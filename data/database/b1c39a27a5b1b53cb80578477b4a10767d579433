        "headline":"Sonny Bill Williams: 'All those troubles made me the man I am today'",
        "body":"<p>Sonny Bill Williams describes the moments of fear that have shaped him in a surprisingly quiet voice. On a rainy morning in Liverpool the world's most famous rugby league player wears a grey beanie and a vest that allows his tattooed muscles to shimmer beneath the stark hotel light. His inky skin tautens as Williams searches for the right words to explain his past emotions as an excruciatingly shy teenager and as a feted but controversial icon who crisscrosses the codes amid accusations of arrogance and treachery.</p><p>Williams has won the union World Cup with the All Blacks, two Grand Finals in Australia's NRL and the Super Rugby championship in New Zealand. Apart from playing as a forward in league and \"doing [his] hair with the pretty boys\" as a back in union, Williams is also a professional boxer who has won all of his six heavyweight bouts. Yet he is most expressive when reflecting on vulnerability – whether it is the terrible apprehension he experiences before a fight or remembering how he felt as a boy.</p><p>\"The biggest thing to understand about me is that I moved [from Auckland] to Sydney when I was 15,\" Williams says. \"I was all by myself and that was the hardest thing because I like to stay at home with my family. I went from playing muck-around-footie to training intensely six days a week. I was also working as a labourer. I wake up and it's dark. I get home after training and it's dark. And I wouldn't say boo if I went into a room and two people were there. It took me a long while to get my confidence, bro.\"</p><p>Three years later, in 2004, Williams won his first Grand Final as a rookie. His scintillating play, peppered with gorgeous off‑loads, speed and brutal physicality, made him a star to people who did not understand what he had endured to reach that point at 18. Williams was soon involved in various, as he now refers to them sheepishly, \"alcohol-related indiscretions\".</p><p>In 2008, \"Money-Bill\", as he was tagged, abandoned his team and the sport by walking out on the Canterbury Bulldogs and flying in a private jet to Toulon. His outrageous move to union briefly made him the most reviled man in Australia.</p><p>In Toulon he converted to Islam while learning a very different game alongside Jonny Wilkinson and Tana Umaga. He eventually returned to New Zealand and played 19 times for the All Blacks – and in 2012 became only the third player to have won Super Rugby and NRL titles. After a triumphant return to league this year, capped by a Grand Final win with the Sydney Roosters three weeks ago, Williams agonised over returning to union before finally opting to stay on for one last league season.</p><p>The flip-flopping emotions continued. Williams declared himself unavailable for the Rugby League World Cup and yet, just after the squad was announced, he called Stephen Kearney, the New Zealand coach and his boyhood hero, to stress how much he wanted to play. Tohu Harris had to be dropped to accommodate Williams and the usual Sonny Bill tumult ensued.</p><p>Now, with the World Cup under way, this intriguing sporting wizard is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/09/sonny-bill-williams-new-zealand-world-cup\" title=\"\">bent on helping New Zealand retain the trophy they won in 2008</a>. And for a superstar who apparently dislikes interviews, Williams is  engaging and revelatory in this rare encounter. Sonny Bill can clearly turn on the charm – for he's good at calling me \"boss\", \"bro\" and \"cuz\" – but he also voices some raw emotions.</p><p>\"After that first month in Sydney I went home for two weeks,\" Williams says. \"I didn't want to ever go back because it was so hard. But my old man kicked my arse and I was also pretty driven to try and make it for my family because we didn't have much. That's the cliche for people who come from nothing. But that's how I was in central Auckland. I grew up in a housing-commission house. My parents were always living from pay cheque to pay cheque. They were always struggling. I thought that if I could play rugby on TV I'd be able to get my mum a house. That was the driving factor.\"</p><p>Williams was a brilliant athlete – but he was also insecure. \"By the end of my first year at the Dogs we'd won the competition and I'd played some pretty good footy. But, back then, it was a real drinking culture and I was just a sheep. Now, with reflection, I can say those troubles made me the man that I am today.\"</p><p>What was his state of mind when he left Sydney for Toulon? \"I was young, brash. I get that attitude from my mum's side – if I've been done wrong then I'll make a stance. I thought the whole world was against me and I needed to run away from things. But France was such a humbling experience because I finally understood that footy is just a little speck in the scheme of things. Who am I to think I'm special because I play sport? I found my faith in France, even if I always had Islam in my heart. I grew up as Christian but now I've found the right God. In my second year at Toulon I really devoted myself to Islam.</p><p>\"Over there I played with Jonny Wilkinson, [Juan Martín] Fernández Lobbe, Tana Umaga, the list was crazy. You couldn't have a better apprenticeship than under those guys – especially Jonny. He's pretty spiritual, Jonny, and he said I was one of the best players he'd played with.</p><p>\"To hear it from a guy like that gives you confidence. Jonny was one of the big factors in me deciding to go back to New Zealand and give it a crack with the All Blacks. League is much more demanding physically. But, mentally, rugby is more testing. I had to help the No10. He's calling the game and you have to look for space and defensive weaknesses. You're always thinking. But in league I play in the forwards and love it.\"</p><p>He is the unequivocal star of this World Cup – offering an irresistible blend of glamour and gravitas – but it was more difficult at rugby union's equivalent tournament in 2011. Williams has his winner's medal but, in the final, he only came on as a late substitute in the nervy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/23/rugby-world-cup-richie-mccaw-new-zealand-france\" title=\"\">8-7 victory over France</a>. \"It was tough. I understand that they had their team for a few years leading up to it but I felt I had played well enough to get a regular start. But we won and that's all that matters. I trained as hard as I could and when I played, I did well. But a driving factor is to have another good season of league and then to go back and get in that All Black squad again.\"</p><p>The ferocious ambition in Williams, as he moves between sports, is often greeted with disdain. \"I understand the criticism. The rugby guys and the league guys are both staunch. They believe rugby is the game or league is the game. You're a traitor to leave either. But I just do what I feel is right in my heart. I try to be a good man, first and foremost, and then commit 120%.</p><p>\"You have to be humble with your team-mates. I always say: 'Get the boys' respect, work your arse off and then the flash play, your talent, comes out.' In the last two seasons, at the Chiefs and the Roosters, I got players' player of the year. That matters more than anything – because who knows more than those guys? When I go into different situations the pressure is all on me and I don't know if people appreciate it. I have everything to lose – but also everything to gain. The Chiefs came 13th the year before [he joined] and then we won it.  I then came to Sydney and the Roosters after five years of not playing rugby league – not even watching it. So I copped it. But in the end I got to play really well, have my best season and win the competition.\"</p><p>Williams takes off his beanie and ruffles his hair. He looks suddenly amazed. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\" title=\"\">I could not have had a worse start in the Grand Final</a>. I dropped a couple of balls which led to tries and then I went in at half-time and my mental strength blocked everything out. I was really low on confidence but I said to the boys: 'I'm gonna run hard and work as hard as I can. I expect you to do the same.' This came from me, a guy who's had the worst half of his year, telling the boys that this is what I was going to do. So I went out in the second half and did exactly that and we won. I put pressure on myself to do it.\"</p><p>He is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/01/new-zealand-sonny-boy-williams\" title=\"\">more modest fighter</a> but his words ring true as he reflects on all he has learned in the ring. \"Boxing taught me mental strength and knowing I could go to places I never thought I could. I'm never going to be the world heavyweight champion but it's taught me so much. I came from not even being able to throw a punch to slowly improving to sitting in the changing rooms and not wanting to go out. I was that scared.\"</p><p>He listens intently when I describe interviewing formidable fighters, such as Mike Tyson, who spoke lucidly about the fear that almost consumed them before a fight. \"Exactly. Think of Tyson, at the peak of his powers, and me, an average Joe Blow, who hasn't even had an amateur career. And lots of people are watching because of my profile outside the ring. All six fights were hard but the toughest was when I won the New Zealand title. It was my fifth fight. I felt like I'd improved as a boxer and the opportunity was there to fight for the vacant title.</p><p>\"My manager said: 'Are you crazy? You haven't fought more than six rounds.' I can be pretty confident but before the fight it was the worst thing ever. You've been training so intensely and then it's four days out, three days out. It's such a lonely feeling. You're just scared, feeling: 'I hate this … what am I doing?' But the boxing drug gets you. There is so much pressure and you're that scared but when you come through the other side it's the best feeling in the world.</p><p>\"I <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6CFkeWpNhg\" title=\"\">knocked [Clarence Tillman] out</a> in the first round to win the title. Even I couldn't believe it. I clipped him with a sweet left hook and his legs wobbled. All the technique I'd been learning just went out the window. It was like a street fight. I thought I was going to kick him. But the jubilation when it's over is like nothing I've ever experienced. It was me facing the darkest moment, alone, and coming through. So boxing's taught me I can face anything – even as a very average bloke in the ring.\"</p><p>Sonny Bill is the opposite of an \"average bloke\" on the rugby field. His awareness of all that he can achieve forced him to change his mind about this World Cup. \"After the Grand Final I was 70-30 thinking I was going back to rugby. I didn't want to take anyone's [World Cup] spot. It's ironic because I ended up doing that. But I couldn't sleep the night I said I was unavailable. The next morning the team was named and I knew I wanted to play. I'd fallen in love with league again – and I knew if I didn't play I'd have regrets the rest of my life. I honestly didn't think a player would have to be dropped. I sent a text to Tohu [Harris] – and tried to get hold of him but he was upset. I want to repay everyone by working hard and playing some good footy.\"</p><p>Williams's grandest ambition is to win this World Cup with New Zealand, have one last searing season of NRL with the Roosters before returning to the Chiefs and All Blacks. He would love to play a full part in New Zealand retaining the rugby union World Cup in 2015, before winning a gold medal in sevens rugby at the 2016 Olympics. \"It sounds a lot, bro, but that's exactly what I'd love to do. There's a lot of hard work and stiff competition ahead. But it's good to be honest and put it all out there as to what I want to achieve. It's going to be intense – but I'm ready for everything.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421135374|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|de5f932763621f3b0ea633a8b821da3d1c1cc36c -->",

        "headline":"Sam Burgess' band of brothers back home to give England extra muscle",
        "body":"<p>\"I love this feeling,\" Sam Burgess says of the emotion that has been uncorked inside his huge frame. Even the darkening sky on a rainy afternoon in Salford is a source of pleasure for Burgess as he returns home after three years amid the sunshine and brutality of the NRL. \"I love being back in England, walking around and soaking up the whole place. It means a lot after I've been away so long.\"</p><p>Over coffee at Salford City Stadium, he seems entranced at first by the familiar old grey weather of home. It allows Burgess to remember the previous six extraordinary years which have been underpinned by the loss of his father to motor neurone disease, moving to Australia in 2009, his emergence as an authoritative presence in the NRL and a subsequent story of brotherly success.</p><p>He was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/04/sam-burgess-bradford-bulls-russell-crowe\" title=\"\">lured to the South Sydney Rabbitohs from Bradford by Russell Crowe</a>, the movie-star owner who charmed the young Yorkshireman with tales of the club's working-class roots and his plans to revitalise a winning heritage stalled for more than 40 years. There has since been a sweeping Hollywood backdrop to the Burgess saga, for having been joined by his three brothers in adding family-reared British beef to the team, the Rabbitohs appeared on course to become NRL champions this season. The involvement of the Burgess boys has been irresistible, especially as they are cheered on by their mother, Julie, in Sydney.</p><p>A World Cup twist has deepened their impact, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/01/england-burgess-brothers-world-cup\" title=\"\">three of the four brothers have been picked for the England squad</a>. Sam Burgess will be England's key player, particularly in the opening match against Australia on Saturday at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. His younger brothers, the twins George and Tom, will also help England attempt to buck history by winning the tournament for the first time since Great Britain lifted the World Cup in 1972. Only Luke, their eldest brother, has been left behind in Sydney.</p><p>Yet, beyond their family breakthrough, Burgess's poignant memories of his father resonate. He talks in moving detail about his death – and of all they shared in the last shattering 18 months when, while still a teenager, he helped care for his dad as he wasted away. \"Dad was a big guy,\" the 24-year-old says of his father, Mark, once a typically tough front-row forward in semi-professional rugby league. \"You never want to see your dad being sick but it was even harder because he was a very proud man who liked to be active. Motor neurone disease is horrible. And it's so tough to watch it bring down your own dad …\"</p><p>Burgess's voice trails away for, eventually, his father could not even talk, let alone walk. \"When dad deteriorated he couldn't get to bed at night. I would carry him up the stairs. I was only 18 [in 2007] and we had a little technique to get through it. We would count the stairs, and there were 21 of them. It was easier carrying him down, I'll tell you that. But, carrying him up, we had a little laugh. It was our way of getting through it – laughing and counting the stairs.\"</p><p>He looks up with touching restraint when I suggest that, despite the terrible debilitation, at least he had time to treasure his father in a way that would not have been possible if he had lost him suddenly in a car accident. \"It's a tough one to answer. We always valued dad. He was our biggest hero and a great father. We enjoyed every day with dad but probably more so when we found out he was ill.</p><p>\"My dad enjoyed just going to Morrisons. We'd push him round Morrisons in his wheelchair. He also liked sitting in our conservatory, at the back of the house, listening to the rain on the roof. He loved that sound. So we'd sit in the conservatory and listen to the rain together. Or my dad's mates from rugby league would come round. They'd sit there for hours, telling stories, laughing. There were obviously challenging days. My dad hated being looked after because he was so proud but when I look back now the memories are more of the fun we had. I get joy in remembering that.\"</p><p>Burgess describes the process of reliving such raw and contrasting emotions as \"confronting but rewarding; they also make me understand what a fantastic woman my mum has been\".</p><p><a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/meet-the-magnificent-mrs-burgess/story-fni0cvc9-1226690449682\" title=\"\">Julie Burgess might cut a formidable figure while watching her sons at the Rabbitohs</a> but she once had a different plan for her boys. Her famous son shakes his head shyly. \"Mum's dream was for all of us to go to university. Unfortunately I went straight into playing full-time after school but I'm studying small business management so I do a bit to keep my brain working. But mum speaks five languages. She's fluent in French and Spanish and she can talk German and Italian too. She's an impressive woman.</p><p>\"She used to work as an assistant principal at Swallow Hill in Leeds. It was quite a tough school but she loved it. Mum did really well to get this new position in Sydney. At Scots College, which is quite an exclusive school, she's teaching French and English. She actually messaged me this morning. Her school have auctioned us off. All four of us brothers are off to a barbecue with whoever wins the auction.\"</p><p>Burgess's passion for the Rabbitohs, whom he joined in 2010, is also plain. \"I had this strong feeling for the club right away. Russell spoke a lot about what the club stood for and it sat very well with me. And I loved the history. The club are [among] the oldest in Australian rugby league and were formed in 1908. They've won the most Premierships of anyone – 20 – but not since 1971. Russell wants to bring back the glory days and his vision makes you understand what it means to South Sydney.  I put my trust in him.\"</p><p>Apart from being one of the best players in the NRL and described regularly as being among Sydney's \"most eligible bachelors\", Burgess loves appearing alongside his brothers. Luke signed for the Rabbitohs in 2011, with George following a year later while, this season, Tom completed the Burgess quartet. \"Luke's my older brother and we were always very close. So playing with him is fantastic. But George is my younger brother and to see him work so hard to get into the first team and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/08/nrl-end-of-season-awards\" title=\"\">become [the NRL's] rookie of the year </a>was special.</p><p>\"The three of us played together for the first time against the [Canterbury] Bulldogs [in June 2012]. Me and George walked out for the warm-up and Luke was behind us in the tunnel. He said it was a great feeling watching the two of us. He stood back and enjoyed that moment. That really hit home and now when all four of us play together I try to watch the boys and see what they're doing. It's a cool thing to play with all my brothers.\"</p><p>Tom made his Rabbitohs debut 12 months later but the most evocative moment occurred in late August when all the Burgess boys were on the field together against Wests Tigers. It was the first time in more than 100 years that four brothers had played in the same NRL side. \"It was crazy,\" Burgess says. \"We were top of the table and Wests were struggling but in the first few minutes I got sin-binned for a professional foul. I was off for 10 minutes and you have to go to the dressing room and I was watching it in there on TV.</p><p>\"We were soon 18-0 down. That's a lot in the NRL. But, once I got out there again, I knew if we scored one try we'd eventually claw back before half-time. We managed to get the win in the end [32-18 as Sam and Luke scored tries]. There was a period of the game when we had the ball one after the other. It was a great experience and something I'll look back on in 10 years and really value. We'll have a few beers and a yarn about that day.\"</p><p>A romantic continuation of the story would have seen the Rabbitohs win their first championship in 42 years and all four brothers play in the World Cup but expectations that they would reach the Grand Final imploded when they lost to Manly. \"Hmm,\" Burgess says, scrunching up his face. \"That wound is still open. Let's not rub salt in it.\"</p><p>There was family disappointment, too, when Luke was not picked for England. \"He's certainly devastated,\" Burgess says. \"He dislocated his shoulder in pre-season and only managed to play 10 games and that hindered his chances but Luke has done amazingly well. He came through the back of the whole league system and succeeded purely on attitude. People might have doubted him but he worked hard to improve his game. He's our starting front-rower and has been very good.\"</p><p>Luke has the consolation of spending an off-season with his newly-born daughter in Sydney while his brothers prepare for the World Cup. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/19/england-italy-rugby-league-world-cup-warm-up\" title=\"\">The embarrassment of losing a friendly last Saturday to Italy</a> can be attributed to the fact that England have been thinking ahead for weeks to the tournament opener against Australia. If Burgess has done more than anyone in recent memory to overcome most Australians' traditional scepticism towards British rugby league he is aware that doubt remains. Even though the great Australian coach, Wayne Bennett, picked Burgess for the All-Stars before he had played a single NRL game, he faced initial disdain from less knowledgeable fans.</p><p>\"I don't know how much they respect the English Super League so you're always going to get that but it didn't bother me. I was lucky Wayne Bennett wild-carded me into the All-Stars. He said: 'I want this kid to play.' So I started in the front row and did OK.\"</p><p>Burgess is far more famous in Australia than England – and his celebrity in Sydney is such that he delights in his relative anonymity at home. \"We went round the Trafford Centre the other day for a walk and it was great. No one stopped us – until a couple of Aussies spotted us.\"</p><p>He is so immersed in Australian rugby league that Burgess talks longingly about his desire to play in the compelling State of Origin series – an annual best-of-three showdown between New South Wales and Queensland. \"I go and watch the Origin games and get goosebumps every time. I'd love to do it but it would probably dilute the purity of the game. I know there're some Kiwis in there – but it also dilutes the history. Of course I'd love to be on that stage and if the opportunity ever arose I'd want to do it. You can tell there's a real mix of opinion – certainly judging by social media. Some people say they would love to see me play – others think it's a joke. There has been a lot of controversy about some of the players who've made it but me and Sonny Bill Williams are in the same boat. We'd love to play State of Origin but probably will never get a chance to do so. I understand the reasons.\"</p><p>This season two Englishmen have been named player of the year for their respective NRL clubs – Burgess for South Sydney and James Graham for the Bulldogs. \"It's good for English rugby league,\" Burgess says, \"and Sam Tomkins is going to be a great force in the NRL [for New Zealand Warriors] next year. But there will always be doubters until we can become a consistent force that can match and beat the Aussies.\"</p><p>Australia will be overwhelming World Cup favourites and the prospect of a Hollywood ending for England is unlikely. \"I'm aware that we last won the World Cup in 1972,\" Burgess says. \"That's almost as long as South Sydney's drought in the NRL. If we could pull it off and win the World Cup at home, with me playing alongside two of my brothers, it would be amazing. But, whatever happens, we just feel good being home again.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420554745|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|8f5134c563603dd5886c687d7d6e6ac02bed68e6 -->",

But I understand, with the situation of staying in league, that might not be an option. </p><p>\"But it's good to have made my intentions clear for the next three years. I wanted to put it all out there as I am overhearing what I am going to do as everyone else.\" </p><p>Controversy is never far from Williams and even his decision to play in the upcoming league World Cup involved a backflip on his original plan and another player being dropped.</p><p>With Williams also hoping to feature in the New Zealand sevens team at the 2016 Olympics, he said he had decided to put his boxing career on hold. </p><p>\"I won't have the time to box in the next three years,\" he said.  The NZRU had better luck in their negotiations with All Blacks No8 Kieran Read and lock Sam Whitelock, who on Sunday announced they had committed to playing on with the national team and Canterbury Crusaders until 2017.<br /> <br />\"The fact that two world-class players in Kieran and Sam have re-signed for four more years is a huge positive for the All Blacks,\" All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said in a news release. </p><p>\"Not only are they part of the current success of the team, but it means we have a nucleus of experienced players to take the team into the future beyond 2015, which is fantastic.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419814857|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|3fbf035ee69f23ad63c929a87a22054061605bd4 -->",

It is likely he will be playing for the Roosters,\" it wrote. \"Disappointing but we put our best foot forward, &amp; in the end @SonnyBWilliams made his decision, NZ Rugby's Neil Sorensen said.\"</p><p>Sorenson, the NZRU general manager of professional rugby, indicated they would leave the door open for Williams to return in 2015 ahead of that year's Rugby World Cup.</p><p>\"We obviously worked pretty hard to bring Sonny home, and we have had some really good conversations with him,\" he said. \"As we do with many players who leave New Zealand, we will continue to keep the lines of communication open with him about his playing career.\"</p><p>The Chiefs coach Dave Rennie took a similar line after failing to get Williams back to the club  where he won a title in 2012.</p><p>\"While we are disappointed that Sonny won't be with us in 2014 now, well be keen to keep talking to him about future options,\" said Rennie.</p><p>Williams and his agent Khoder Nasser were on Thursday filmed having lunch with Sorenson, Rennie and his assistant coach Wayne Smith in Sydney, fuelling speculation he was returning to rugby union.</p><p>The 28-year-old looked set to walk away from the NRL when he made himself unavailable for the Rugby League World Cup on Monday.</p><p>However, later that day he contacted Kiwis coach Stephen Kearney to say he had changed his mind and wanted to help New Zealand defend their title in Britain later this month.</p><p>Williams was subsequently added to the squad at the expense of Melbourne back-rower Tohu Harris.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419665044|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|fa61e5406457ce6452bb03eacc81aaa2a0cd32a0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Wigan have welcomed suggestions from Australia that they will be offered the chance to become the first British team to play a World Club Challenge fixture in Sydney for almost 40 years.</p><p>The Super League champions have enjoyed home advantage in each of the 14 games against Australasia's champion club team since the challenge was revived in 2000. But now the Sydney Roosters, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\" title=\"\">won the National Rugby League Grand Final by beating Manly last weekend</a>, are said to be receptive to the idea of hosting the fixture.</p><p>\"We would love to go to Sydney,\" said Wigan's chairman, Ian Lenagan. \"Wigan were the last British club to play in Australia, with that great win against the Broncos in Brisbane in 1994, so this would be an elegant way to celebrate the 20th anniversary. The practicalities aren't marvellous, but we would be delighted to find a way around them.\"</p><p>The Roosters were the last Sydney team to stage the challenge, when they were known as Eastern Suburbs and beat St Helens 25-2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground in June 1976.  That was the first World Club Challenge, and since then it has been held only once in Australia – when Wigan claimed their famous victory in Brisbane in 1994.</p><p>English clubs – most often Leeds, who have played in five of the last six games – have regularly urged the Australian authorities to show more enthusiasm for the concept, rather than complaining about the odds being stacked against them when they swapthe southern-hemisphere summer for a one-off game in February in the north of England.</p><p>That has not stopped Australian dominance of the fixture, with four wins in the last five years. But Andrew Hill, the NRL's general manager, told the Sydney Daily Telegraph: \"There is a strong consideration for the game to be played in Australia.\"</p><p>Hull have made a rare signing from English rugby union, recruiting Tom Biggs, a Bath wing who has played for the England Saxons and Sevens team but was born in east Yorkshire, on a three-year contract.</p><p>Sam Burgess has welcomed the surprise inclusion of Sonny Bill Williams in New Zealand's World Cup squad. The South Sydney forward, who is currently in South Africa with his younger twin brothers Tom and George at England's training base in Potchefstroom, has relished <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-dhEcvkY7U&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">two clashes with Williams in derbies between the Rabbitohs and the Roosters this season</a>.</p><p>\"He's one of the best players in the world so I'm certainly looking forward to that,\" said Burgess. \"I'll stick within the structure here and hopefully not go stray far out and go looking for him. But if it arises in the middle of the game, I'm sure neither me nor him will shy away from the confrontation.\"</p><p><em>• England will kick off their Rugby League World Cup 2013 campaign against Australia on 26 October at the Millennium Stadium.

        "body":"<h2>Team of the year: Roosters</h2><p>A no-brainer this one. The Roosters were by comfortable margins the best attacking team all year and the best defensive team. Accordingly they won 18 of their 24 matches and secured the minor premiership. Then, in order to win their first grand final since 2002, they beat seasoned pros Manly twice in the finals (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sydney-roosters-win-nrl-grand-final\">despite entering the last half hour of the decider 18-8 down</a>). The Tricolours proved a perfect storm of big money well spent (Sonny Bill Williams, James Maloney and Michael Jennings), hardened regulars (eight of whom suffered through the Roosters' 2010 grand final defeat), and the ability of rookie coach Trent Robinson to pull all these components together and make them tick.</p><h2>Players of the year: Daly Cherry-Evans and Andrew Fifita</h2><p>Before his injury in State of Origin, Souths' fullback Greg Inglis was on track to win this award and any other award ever invented (Miss North Dakota? Why not?). He'll be gutted to miss out on this gong, no doubt, but his relatively quiet second half of the year – conducted on one-and-a-half knees – saw him slip out of contention.</p><p>For my money (about $4.25 in change) Manly's Daly Cherry-Evans was the year's best back with Cronulla's Andrew Fifita pipping Sonny Bill Williams and Jared Waerea-Hargreaves as best forward. Cherry-Evans is one of the game's best first receivers and he was the WD40 that kept Manly's right-side attack lubricated. An astute kicker, dangerous with the ball in hand, and always willing to test the defence himself, Cherry-Evans has really matured as a footballer and any New South Welshmen who were waiting for Cooper Cronk to go off the boil so NSW could win another Origin <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDolu85Dfvs\">will now have to wait out Cherry-Evans's term as well</a>.</p><p>Fifita, meantime, was NSW's best player, and though he played an average of 50-odd minutes a game for the Sharks he averaged huge metres (about 150-a-game) and was so much more than a battering ram. He's got a step, he's evasive, he's got good hands and genuine speed. And in further good news for the Sharks (a team always in need of good news, particularly this Asada-affected year), <a href=\"http://www.sharks.com.au/news-display/Fifita-a-fan-favourite/85507?pid=sharks_around\">he's also got a twin brother, David</a>.</p><h2>Try most likely to make you sit up and go 'wow!': David Nofoaluma</h2><p>The Wests Tigers were like idiot savants this year. Though bad enough on the field to finish second last they provided more than their fair share of spectacular tries, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IildDyAahHE\">from a length-of-the-field effort against the Storm</a>, to a piece of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg9G8GEHZuE\">individual brilliance from youngster Tim Simona</a>. The try of the year, however, was scored by the Tigers' other winger, David Nofoaluma, against Manly. Leaping for a Benji Marshall cross-field bomb Nofoaluma took the ball above Jorge Taufua but in doing became inverted at the same time his body was drifting over the sideline in-goal. No matter. As if he had all the time in the world to think about the problem and find a solution to it, Nofoaluma calmly reached out and grounded the ball. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61iHH5z0zlw\">But words are inadequate</a>.</p><h2>Most entertaining press conference: Geoff Toovey</h2><p>You've got to enjoy Manly coach Geoff Toovey. In a game of increasingly bland interviews and scripted sound bites the angry ant wears his heart on his sleeve. When Manly lost 22-10 to South Sydney in August, Toovey, believing Manly had been hard done by, wasn't about to be put off by the threat of a $10,000 fine. His querulous tone, his bulging eyes, his well-chosen words (\"C'mon, that's ridiculous! That's <em>ridiculous</em>! There's gotta be an investigation into this! Someone's gotta be accountable for this!\") <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2pkS_TW3a8\">capped a perfect performance</a>.</p><h2>Best rookie: George Burgess</h2><p>Raiders rookie fullback Anthony Milford was a gun this season making 17 line-breaks in 18 matches and helping those in Canberra forget the man he replaced, <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/josh-dugans-management-fear-nrl-will-face-calls-to-deregister-canberra-raiders-star/story-e6frexnr-1226596729134\">the Rooftop Recalcitrant, Josh Dugan</a>. In a mediocre team who were worse travellers than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pilkington\">Karl Pilkington</a> he was a real ray of light. So too was Penrith's dynamic fullback Matthew Moylan who had old timers tilting their hats back and whistling after his man-of-the-match debut against the Eels in April. But for me, the rookie of the year was George Burgess, the 21-year-old South Sydney colossus who arrived at Redfern very much in the shadow (figuratively speaking… for he's far too big to be cast in anyone's actual shadow) of his older brother Sam. Before long, however, George was making his own name, and from a bench player he became a significant member of Souths' pack, racking up 30-odd tackles a game and taking his sledgehammer frame to opposition defensive walls. And there's more to come. On the back of his stellar season he's in the England squad for the World Cup.</p><h2>Curious decisions that look worse in hindsight: Ricky Stuart's cleanout at Parramatta and Steve Price's re-signing</h2><p>Back in June, Parramatta's coach Ricky Stuart, believing a major cleanout was needed in order to rebuild the team, told 12 players they had the remainder of the season to clear out their lockers and find gainful employment for 2014. Already in a hole the Eels preceded to dig themselves a deeper one, finishing wooden spooners. In September, not long after the Eels were beaten 64-4 by the Storm, Stuart activated a get-out clause in his contract and signed a three-year deal to coach at his alma mater, Canberra, from 2014. That rebuilding project? No longer Stuart's problem. Unfortunate timing to say the least. </p><p>Steve Price, meantime, struggled with St George Illawarra through 2012 and you felt he had 2013 to prove his credentials. After the Dragons lost their first three matches, they won their next three. It was a spirited, if unspectacular return to equilibrium, but then, <em>during</em> the Dragons' next game, one against the Roosters on Anzac Day, it was announced that Price had been granted a contract extension to coach until the end of 2014. To celebrate, the Dragons were duly thumped 34-10 and won just four of their next 17 games including losses to the last placed Eels, and second-last placed Tigers. Given this form Price will surely start 2014 as favourite for the unwanted book kept on coach most likely… to be sacked.</p><h2>Most expensive wee: Russell Packer</h2><p>When school children need to go to the toilet they either put their hands up and asked to be excused or they do it in their pants, whatever's more convenient. When faced with a similar decision against the Broncos at Suncorp, New Zealand Warrior Russell Packer chose Option B and, with hands on hips, relieved himself where he stood, giving himself away by staring into the middle distance (like he was thinking about puppies frolicking in a sprinkler on a warm summer's day) and by rigorously shaking his legs dry when he was done. Only a professional offense taker would have been offended by it but, still, the NRL can't allow carte blanche when it comes to such things (talking about opening Pandora's Box) so it had little choice but to fine Packer $15,000. A golden stream indeed.</p><h2>Most frustrating team: New Zealand Warriors</h2><p>With footballers like Shaun Johnson, Kevin Locke, Manu Vatuvei, Konrad Hurrell, Thomas Leuluai and Feleti Mateo in the squad, the Warriors were, on their day, the best team to watch by some distance. Exciting, chancy and adventurous, they played with childlike joy at times, as if there were no consequences if things went wrong. On other days, however, they just didn't seem interested; or at least you questioned their willingness to roll up the sleeves when a grind was the most prudent course of action. Oh Warriors, you coulda been a contender.</p><h2>Most comical interview that wasn't an interview: Blake Ferguson</h2><p>Raiders winger Blake Ferguson was brilliant when he made it on to the field this year and he earned himself a Blues jersey. Off the field, however, he brought himself into disrepute, if such a thing can be done. During his enforced convalescence he was taken under the wing of his well-intentioned, clean-living uncle, Anthony Mundine, who became Ferguson's spokesperson; even when Ferguson was sitting right next to him. Given Mundine isn't exactly Martin Luther King in the oration stakes it was like calling for a runner in cricket but picking one on crutches. <a href=\"http://www.triplem.com.au/sydney/sport/nrl/news/2013/9/video-blake-ferguson-anthony-mundine-hilarious-press-conference/\">Classic stuff</a>.</p><h2>Best promotion of a game that would never be played: Channel Nine</h2><p>Nothing like being prepared for all eventualities but, like text messages from someone you're having an affair with (or so I imagine, sweetheart), you've got to destroy the evidence at the earliest opportunity or it'll come back to bite you. Whatever you do, don't broadcast it on TV. What's that, Nine?<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=2JwdCAlV8hI\"> A Knights v Rabbitohs grand final, you say?</a></p><h2>Most spectacular display of contempt for your audience: Channel Nine</h2><p>A double win for Nine, well done! This award goes to Nine for its grand final coverage in Melbourne. Minutes after the conclusion of the grand final (after some on-field interviews and lingering shots of Sonny Bill Williams) coverage abruptly ended. What on earth would cause Nine to miss the awarding of the Provan-Summons trophy to the winning team, the equivalent of the kissing scene at the end of a rom-com? It would have to be huge news, right? A military coup in Washington DC? Live coverage of a wet and wild brawl between Clive Palmer and Gina Reinhart at a Korean bathhouse? An interview with Buddy Franklin about what he had for dinner? No. The Hangover II. Nine has form in this area (it's been denying fans of the winning team their due for years… and if your team wins the premiership but you don't see them lifting the trophy did it really happen?) but still. What the hell, Nine?!</p><h2>Team of the Year</h2><p>1. Greg Inglis, 2. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, 3. Jamie Lyon, 4. Michael Jennings, 5. Jorge Taufua, 6.  John Sutton, 7. Daly Cherry-Evans, 8.

But in what was a gripping grand final (a shade off a classic, I'd argue, given the number of errors) they found a way to win. That's premiership quality. Their resolve – which netted coach Trent Robinson a premiership in his rookie year, won nice-guy captain Anthony Minichiello a long-awaited second title, and showed Sonny Bill Williams is either a common denominator in success (All Blacks, Chiefs, now Roosters) or has a knack for knowing which ride to hitch his wagon to – looked even more impressive when the final stats came out. The Roosters made more errors (12-6), missed more tackles (27-22), completed fewer sets from more possessions (22/35 or 63% to Manly's 23/28 or 82%), made fewer line breaks (3-5), fewer tackle breaks (22-27), and they lost the penalty count 2-5.</p><p>So how did they win? David Williams's horror night helped (see below) but it was in the back end of the game that they scored the bulk of their points suggesting Manly's grueling final series, and the extra 37 tackles they had to make on Sunday night, became a factor. But still the Roosters had to find holes and capitalise. And that's what they were able to do, with the three players who made the difference late on being their three new signings: Sonny Bill Williams, James Maloney and Michael Jennings. Nice bit of business, that.</p><h2>James Maloney had a great claim for man of the match</h2><p>Manly's Daly Cherry-Evans had a wonderful grand final but it's surprising to say the least that he won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground ahead of Maloney. The Roosters' five-eighth was instrumental in his team winning the premiership, which you'd have to think is the main criteria in selecting the Clive Churchill medallist. His pinpoint cross-field bomb set up the Roosters' opening try to Daniel Tupou, his midfield burst following a Williams offload helped create the Roosters' third, and it was his grubber kick into the Manly in-goal that Jennings swooped on in the 73rd minute to score the match-sealer. Throw in his four out of four conversions and a penalty goal and his being overlooked becomes baffling. Still, if he's actually bothered, he should be consoled by his premiership ring. </p><h2>Manly were unlucky</h2><p>Plenty will argue that Manly used up their allocation of luck when awarded a penalty try just after half-time. Perhaps they're right. Jamie Lyon was certainly tackled without the ball but could you say without any doubt that he would have scored after collecting the bouncing ball (which at this time was grubbering surreptitiously away to his left, like someone trying to sneak out of a party before his mates see him)? I couldn't. <br /> <br />Nevertheless many other decisions went against Manly, some critical. An early knock-on from Mitchell Pearce on his own 20m was let go; Kieran Foran was called for a knock-on with the refs missing Pearce's strip; Jared Waerea-Hargreaves's head-butt (though gentle, like a horse nuzzling for affection) was not deemed worthy of penalising (meaning Maloney kicked a penalty goal from in-front for Manly holding the player down too long); Jennings's touch on a Lyon grubber kick should have resulted in a Manly ball 10m out from the Roosters' line a minute from half-time; and Maloney's pass to Minichiello prior to the Shaun-Kenny Dowall match-leveller was clearly forward. It would have for made compelling TV but Geoff Toovey did well to stop his head from exploding in a rain of goop against the Perspex walls of his viewing box.</p><h2>Williams and Jennings made timely interventions</h2><p>Given he makes hairy-eared commentators swoon like girls at a One Direction concert it feels almost blasphemous to say that for the first 60 minutes of the grand final Sonny Bill Williams was close to the worst player on the field. Up until that point his contributions included a collection of passes that hit the turf, a knock-on 15m out from his own line (which gifted Manly possession which they used to score their opening try), and a bad read in defence that created space for Manly's third try. It seemed that all his earnest conversations with the heavens were being ignored. Perhaps God was watching Big Momma's House on Nine's digital dumping ground, Go! </p><p>Or perhaps not. Because on the hour mark Sonny Bill's fortunes changed. First he angled a hit-up back inside at Cherry-Evans and his half-bust made room for his big right paw to finesse the ball into Maloney's midriff. It put Maloney on the long run that set up the Kenny-Dowall try and regain the lead for the Roosters. Later, Williams burst through the guts of the Manly line like a bird's eye chilli and it was soon after that Jennings – who'd been anonymous in attack – scorched through the in-goal before diving full-length to brilliantly touch down Maloney's kick. Cometh the hour etc etc.</p><h2>Tupou and Williams: it was the best of times, it was the worst of times</h2><p>If the AFL aren't scared off after the Israel Folau debacle they could do worse than look at Roosters winger Daniel Tupou. Unlike Folau, whose enormous frame was put on breeze blocks by Greater Western Sydney's trainers and stripped back to bare bones, Tupou already has the feline lines of an Aussie Rules footballer. And he can leap and mark  (with grace) as he showed with his try over his opposite winger David Williams on Sunday, which was a carbon copy of his try last week over Akuila Uate. Oddly, however, Williams didn't even attempt to jump. Instead he looked up at Tupou like he was an eclipse of the sun. And as we all know you're not supposed to look at an eclipse.<br /> <br />The scenario almost repeated itself 13 minutes into the second half when a high ball plummeted Williams's way with Tupuo preparing his leap. Utterly rattled, Williams only had eyes for Tupou and the ball hit the Sea Eagle without him even attempting to catch it. This led to a drop out and in the next set Mitchell Pearce put Aidan Guerra into a hole and the Roosters clawed the score back to 18-14. Finally, with the game on the line, when Maloney's grubber was bobbling through the Manly in-goal, Jennings ran an opponent who seemed to pull up, as if believing the ball was going to run dead. What player? David Williams. Sport can be cruel.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419203200|2013-11-05T11:03:51Z|238908516e42a46783339b6c906e2a8e0b640192 -->",
