Knockout’s nine-width, four-weight family offers a range of options that cannot be achieved with even the best modern sans serifs. Most fonts begin their life with maybe just a regular, bold and italic version. If a design is successful then more weights are added as required over the years.

Unlike other more functional sans serifs, Gill was imbued with distinctive characteristics – look at the cap “R”, for instance. Used extensively by many, including the BBC – Gill also made sculptures for the facade of Broadcasting House in London.
