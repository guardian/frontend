Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning’s release. The one-time imam of south London’s Brixton mosque has been a fervent online champion of Isis, even supporting the kidnapping and rape of Yazidi minority women in Iraq. In the video released on Wednesday morning, Faisal begged for Henning’s life and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law. There are growing signs that the kidnap of Henning is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis’s tactics. Faisal’s intervention is the clearest example so far. With previous kidnappings some Isis-supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but, according to reports, Isis’s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of any such charge. In the 2 min 40 sec video the Jamaican preacher, who was jailed in 2003, says: “This is a message to my brothers in the Islamic State. It is well known to the world that you have a hostage by the name of Alan Henning and that his life is in jeopardy. “I’ve spoken to many people about Alan Henning and everyone spoke well about him.

Henning, 47 was kidnapped by Isis militants in Syria in 2012 when his aid convey was stopped by masked gunmen and he was forcibly separated from his party. “I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate,” Barbara Henning said in a statement.\n“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.” Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system.

During his 45-minute talk delivered from Jamaica, Faisal was heard saying: “Instead of embracing the Islamic State, supporting the Islamic State and doing everything humanly possible for the success of the state … all they do is slander the mujahideen,” he said. The scholar, who has a reputation for describing many Muslim groups as heretics who should be condemned to death, recently tweeted that Isis was a punishment from Allah for “all fake Muslims who don’t want Islam”. He has described women captured by Isis militants during the conflict as the “spoils of war”. Towards the end of the video, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, Faisal warns Isis of the consequences of killing Henning: “Killing him has no blessing, it will backfire on the Islamic State in a very bad way, the damage will not be able to be repaired.”","bodyHtml":"<p>A radical Islamic preacher who spent four years in a UK jail for soliciting murder and hate speech has made a video plea for Islamic State (Isis) to spare the life of British hostage Alan Henning.</p> <p>Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning’s release.</p> <p>The one-time imam of south London’s Brixton mosque has been a fervent online champion of Isis, even supporting the kidnapping and rape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\" title=\"\">Yazidi minority women</a> in Iraq.</p> <p>In the video released on Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\" title=\"\">Faisal begged for Henning’s life</a> and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law.</p> <p>There are growing signs that the kidnap of Henning is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis’s tactics.

He is a sympathiser to Muslims.”</p> <p>Sitting behind a desk with the Qur’an in his hands, Faisal continues: “So to kill someone like that, an aid worker, is un-Islamic … the sharia law doesn’t allow you to kill someone like Alan Henning.</p> <p>“Because Alan Henning is not antagonistic towards Muslims, it is un-Islamic to kill such a person … Therefore I plead, I beg of you in the name of God to set this good Samaritan free.”</p> <p>The video came after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Henning’s wife pleaded on Tuesday</a> for her husband to be released.</p> <p>Henning, 47 was kidnapped by Isis militants in Syria in 2012 when his aid convey was stopped by masked gunmen and he was forcibly separated from his party.</p> <p>“I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate,” Barbara Henning said in a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-87964392-116d-403d-959d-125c41bfc9c5\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411554442256/e53ad63e-f201-4996-bf11-b08a17eb2492-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Henning, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family Handout/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.”</p> <p>Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/08/radical-preachers-isis-islamic-state-online-conference\" title=\"\">the Guardian recorded a live online talk</a> in which Faisal condemned others for not supporting Isis. During his 45-minute talk delivered from Jamaica, Faisal was heard saying: “Instead of embracing the Islamic State, supporting the Islamic State and doing everything humanly possible for the success of the state … all they do is slander the mujahideen,” he said.</p> <p>The scholar, who has a reputation for describing many Muslim groups as heretics who should be condemned to death, recently tweeted that Isis was a punishment from Allah for “all fake Muslims who don’t want Islam”.</p> <p>He has described women captured by Isis militants during the conflict as the “spoils of war”.</p> <p>Towards the end of the video, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, Faisal warns Isis of the consequences of killing Henning: “Killing him has no blessing, it will backfire on the Islamic State in a very bad way, the damage will not be able to be repaired.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\"

The prime minister also disclosed that, as the Guardian revealed on Thursday, the RAF 2 squadron based in Cyprus is to operate for longer than April next year, the date they were due to be replaced. The decision represents a minor triumph for the air force, which has been arguing about the importance of air power in conflicts in the Middle East. Tornados brought into service in 1991 during the first Gulf war are due to be disbanded by 2019 in a staged process, but some squadrons due to be taken out of service earlier are now to be reprieved. A new class of Eurofighter Typhoon is to replace the current fleet, but the new class is not yet able to load Brimstone missiles effective against small- and medium-sized targets such as Isis vehicles. Britain is believed to be considering whether to help train the moderate Syrian opposition, a plan proposed by former chief of defence staff Lord Richards before he retired last year but previously rejected by ministers. Strengthening Syrian forces allied to the moderate opposition, as well as Iraqi troops, is seen as a vital step towards defeating Isis, and to this end the government is planning to send British troops to train the Iraqi army. It is unclear whether they will be trained in Iraq or neighbouring countries such as Jordan, or the Gulf states. A small number of British military personnel are already on the ground in northern Iraq supporting Kurdish peshmerga. Cameron’s decision to fly to the airbase suggests he believes the campaign is not likely to end soon. He said he had come to Cyprus to thank the pilots personally for the dangerous work they were undertaking, and went on: “Less than a week into combat operations in Iraq, I wanted to come here to thank our troops for the vital work they’re doing to defeat these barbaric Isil terrorists who threaten security not just in Iraq, Syria and the region, but on the streets of Britain too.” The air strikes by US and UK aircraft are understood to have forced a change of behaviour in Isis fighters, who now have much less freedom of movement. However, intelligence gathering on Isis has shown they are extremely well-organised, with their own shura – or councils of elders – regional governors, and welfare networks. Britain currently has seven combat capable air squadrons compared with the 15 the French air force has. The RAF had 30 combat squadrons at the time of the first Gulf war, and for years has been protesting its contribution to military conflicts in uncontested air space is invaluable. The ageing Tornados – some older than 30 years – have flown as many as 30 surveillance operations over Iraq since mid-August, but were only given political clearance to launch air strikes against Isis forces, mainly in northern Iraq, after MPs voted a week ago for the use of force so long as it does not extend to Syria. The RAF has so far launched strikes on four sorties against Isis assets such as pickup trucks, normally on the advice of Kurdish forces on the ground. The planes may be old, but they are equipped with modern radar and infra-red sights capable of giving highly detailed information on targets. Government sources said the dispatch of the extra Tornados did not signify an increase in the tempo of attacks, but was a move to build the overall resilience of the strike force now that it is clear that the air campaign may be a long one. The prime minister added: “Obviously, these operations are just one element of our strategy. We are also working hard to deliver a training package for Iraqi forces with advisers in Iraq now to assess their needs.” The RAF has argued that the precision of the Brimstone missile is unique as it is capable of hitting a car moving at 70mph from seven miles away. RAF Akrotiri is the UK’s Permanent Joint Operating Base that supports ongoing operations in Afghanistan and has been in service 30 years, used as a forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East and for modern radar infrared sights jet training. Cameron has visited Akrotiri before during RAF operations to enforce a no-fly zone in Libya three years ago. As many as 20 Tornados were operating during the Libya campaign where the US took a more backward role and focussed on air surveillance. Britain and Saudi Arabia are the only two countries that operate Brimstones, that are thought to cost £100,000 each. RAF 2 Squadron is normally based at RAF Marham, Norfolk. It has 12 crews based there.","bodyHtml":"<p>David Cameron has flown to the RAF base in Akrotiri, Cyprus, from which British pilots are launching air strikes against Islamic State (Isis) targets in Iraq, announcing that he was to send a further two Tornado GR4 planes to supplement the six currently operating.</p> <p>The prime minister also disclosed that, as the Guardian revealed on Thursday, the RAF 2 squadron based in Cyprus is to operate for longer than April next year, the date they were due to be replaced.

It is unclear whether they will be trained in Iraq or neighbouring countries such as Jordan, or the Gulf states.</p> <p>A small number of British military personnel are already on the ground in northern Iraq supporting Kurdish peshmerga.</p> <p>Cameron’s decision to fly to the airbase suggests he believes the campaign is not likely to end soon. He said he had come to Cyprus to thank the pilots personally for the dangerous work they were undertaking, and went on: “Less than a week into combat operations in Iraq, I wanted to come here to thank our troops for the vital work they’re doing to defeat these barbaric Isil terrorists who threaten security not just in Iraq, Syria and the region, but on the streets of Britain too.”</p> <p>The air strikes by US and UK aircraft are understood to have forced a change of behaviour in Isis fighters, who now have much less freedom of movement. However, intelligence gathering on Isis has shown they are extremely well-organised, with their own shura – or councils of elders – regional governors, and welfare networks.</p> <p>Britain currently has seven combat capable air squadrons compared with the 15 the French air force has. The RAF had 30 combat squadrons at the time of the first Gulf war, and for years has been protesting its contribution to military conflicts in uncontested air space is invaluable.</p> <p>The ageing Tornados – some older than 30 years – have flown as many as 30 surveillance operations over Iraq since mid-August, but were only given political clearance to launch air strikes against Isis forces, mainly in northern Iraq, after MPs voted a week ago for the use of force so long as it does not extend to Syria.</p> <p>The RAF has so far launched strikes on four sorties against Isis assets such as pickup trucks, normally on the advice of Kurdish forces on the ground. The planes may be old, but they are equipped with modern radar and infra-red sights capable of giving highly detailed information on targets.</p> <p>Government sources said the dispatch of the extra Tornados did not signify an increase in the tempo of attacks, but was a move to build the overall resilience of the strike force now that it is clear that the air campaign may be a long one. The prime minister added: “Obviously, these operations are just one element of our strategy. We are also working hard to deliver a training package for Iraqi forces with advisers in Iraq now to assess their needs.”</p> <p>The RAF has argued that the precision of the Brimstone missile is unique as it is capable of hitting a car moving at 70mph from seven miles away.</p> <p>RAF Akrotiri is the UK’s Permanent Joint Operating Base that supports ongoing operations in Afghanistan and has been in service 30 years, used as a forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East and for modern radar infrared sights jet training.</p> <p>Cameron has visited Akrotiri before during RAF operations to enforce a no-fly zone in Libya three years ago. As many as 20 Tornados were operating during the Libya campaign where the US took a more backward role and focussed on air surveillance.</p> <p>Britain and Saudi Arabia are the only two countries that operate Brimstones, that are thought to cost £100,000 each.</p> <p>RAF 2 Squadron is normally based at RAF Marham, Norfolk. It has 12 crews based there.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9596728","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-03T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2169047","internalRevision":"29","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"British PM flies to Cyprus in move that reveals extent to which he recognises Isis campaign is likely to take time","allowUgc":"false","headline":"More Tornados to join Iraq mission says Cameron on visit to Cyprus airbase","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Patrick Wintour in Akrotiri and Richard Norton-Taylor","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-02T20:00:08.108+01:00","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412273784960/An-RAF-Tornado-GR4-return-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"542d93b1e4b075120190c4ee","newspaperPageNumber":"28","internalStoryPackageCode":"81281","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-05T19:00:08Z","standfirst":"British PM flies to Cyprus in move that reveals extent to which he recognises Isis campaign is likely to take time","linkText":"More Tornados to join Iraq mission says Cameron on visit to Cyprus airbase","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-10-03T01:34:47.000+01:00","internalContentCode":"448759429"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/02/tornados-iraq-mission-cameron-visit-cyprus-airbase","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/oct/02/tornados-iraq-mission-cameron-visit-cyprus-airbase","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-3fe2ee32-87c8-41b2-80d0-6181987d7df7","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/2/1412273791657/An-RAF-Tornado-GR4-return-011.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*47201329","altText":"An RAF Tornado GR4 returning to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus","caption":"An RAF Tornado GR4 returning to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.

The mandate, submitted on Tuesday by the prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, also allows for foreign troops to transit through Turkey and calls for the establishment of a so-called security zone of up to 20 miles inside neighbouring Syria, in what is being cast as a pivotal moment in a war threatening three countries.

Kurdish groups in Turkey and Syria also accuse the ruling Justice and Development party of wanting to use the buffer zone as a means to occupy Kurdish-Syrian enclaves across the border. Others, however, believe President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is determined to move against Isis, but will do so only if pressure on the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, is also increased. Also central to Turkish calls for a buffer zone is the fate of the tomb of the founder of the Ottoman Empire Osman I, marked as Turkish territory by the 1921 Turkey-France border accord and now protected by Turkish troops on Syrian soil near the town of Manbij.\nFor the past year, the tomb has been surrounded by Isis forces, who have faced up to about 50 Turkish special forces troops that were deployed more than six months ago when security concerns moved Ankara to recall the comparatively inexperienced conscripts that had been guarding the shrine. While Isis units have not advanced, they have sprayed graffiti over checkpoints leading towards it. In March, Isis warned in an internet message that they would “raze the tomb” but no such attack has since been launched. The tomb of Osman has been a ready barometer of the accommodation reached between Turkey and Isis since it first gained a foothold in Syria and then Iraq. It is also symbol of a relationship now at a crossroads, with Erdoğan suggesting repeatedly in the past week that the country’s military would get directly involved, possibly with ground troops. Kurds on both sides of the border have warned that such a move might imperil the ongoing peace process between the Turkish government and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party, with Cemil Bayik, co-chair of the Kurdish political umbrella organisation KCK, saying it would spell the end of the peace efforts. “The [peace] process would be over, war would restart,” Bayik told the Turkish daily Radikal. “Because a buffer zone is directed against us.

Strongly advised by the Foreign Office (FCO) not to issue any public appeals, they were forced to keep their grief private.

They’re terrified and thought, ‘well, if the Foreign Office say we shouldn’t say anything then we won’t,’” said a friend of Henning’s, who asked not to be named.</p> \n<p>He said the family had even been discouraged from attending a vigil on Wednesday night in Bolton, organised by Henning’s friends, the Bolton Interfaith Council and the Bolton Council of Mosques. They wanted to attend, it is understood, but were told it wasn’t worth the risk.</p> \n<p>Though Henning lived in Eccles, Salford, he had many friends in Bolton. At the vigil, attended by around 100 people of all faith groups, two of Henning’s youngest supporters urged the terrorists to release the man they call “Uncle Gadget” because he is good at fixing things. Ayesha Majid, 11, said: “He is nice, kind and funny. He used to help us pack the ambulances for the convoys.” Aliyah Amir, also 11, said: “Please pray for him, and Uncle Gadget, if you are listening to this, we hope you will return to us safe and sound. Please free Uncle Gadget.”</p> \n<p>Many members of the congregation, including one baby, were wearing white T-shirts saying “Free Alan ‘Gadget’ Henning”.

We become better humans through our actions and our deeds alone.

They’ll have said, ‘you’re playing into the terrorists’ hands, you’re giving them the publicity they crave, it’s counterproductive’ and so forth,” said the expert, whose firm has extensive experience in kidnap response. But by Saturday, the 47-year-old’s wife, Barbara, appeared to have had enough. She issued her first statement, via the Foreign Office, saying her husband had gone to Syria as an aid volunteer with his Muslim colleagues: “When he was taken he was driving an ambulance full of food and water to be handed out to anyone in need,” she said. “His purpose for being there was no more and no less.

Faisal’s intervention is the clearest example so far. With previous kidnappings some Isis-supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but, according to reports, Isis’s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of any such charge.</p> \n<p>In the 2 min 40 sec video the Jamaican preacher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/24/race.world\" title=\"\">who was jailed in 2003</a>, says: “This is a message to my brothers in the Islamic State. It is well known to the world that you have a hostage by the name of Alan Henning and that his life is in jeopardy.</p> \n<p>“I’ve spoken to many people about Alan Henning and everyone spoke well about him. He loves people. He’s a good Samaritan. He’s a philanthropist. He is a sympathiser to Muslims.”</p> \n<p>Sitting behind a desk with the Qur’an in his hands, Faisal continues: “So to kill someone like that, an aid worker, is un-Islamic … the sharia law doesn’t allow you to kill someone like Alan Henning.</p> \n<p>“Because Alan Henning is not antagonistic towards Muslims, it is un-Islamic to kill such a person … Therefore I plead, I beg of you in the name of God to set this good Samaritan free.”</p> \n<p>The video came after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/23/wife-isis-alan-henning-release-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Henning’s wife

Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning’s release. The one-time imam of south London’s Brixton mosque has been a fervent online champion of Isis, even supporting the kidnapping and rape of Yazidi minority women in Iraq. In the video released on Wednesday morning, Faisal begged for Henning’s life and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law. There are growing signs that the kidnap of Henning is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis’s tactics. Faisal’s intervention is the clearest example so far. With previous kidnappings some Isis-supporting scholars have made the case that they could be spies but, according to reports, Isis’s own sharia court has cleared the aid worker of any such charge. In the 2 min 40 sec video the Jamaican preacher, who was jailed in 2003, says: “This is a message to my brothers in the Islamic State. It is well known to the world that you have a hostage by the name of Alan Henning and that his life is in jeopardy. “I’ve spoken to many people about Alan Henning and everyone spoke well about him. He loves people. He’s a good Samaritan. He’s a philanthropist. He is a sympathiser to Muslims.” Sitting behind a desk with the Qur’an in his hands, Faisal continues: “So to kill someone like that, an aid worker, is un-Islamic … the sharia law doesn’t allow you to kill someone like Alan Henning. “Because Alan Henning is not antagonistic towards Muslims, it is un-Islamic to kill such a person … Therefore I plead, I beg of you in the name of God to set this good Samaritan free.” The video came after a Henning’s wife pleaded on Tuesday for her husband to be released. Henning, 47 was kidnapped by Isis militants in Syria in 2012 when his aid convey was stopped by masked gunmen and he was forcibly separated from his party. “I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan’s fate,” Barbara Henning said in a statement.\n“We are at a loss why those leading Islamic State cannot open their hearts and minds to the facts surrounding Alan’s imprisonment and why they continue to threaten his life.” Barbara Henning said she had been told that her husband had been found innocent of being a spy by a sharia court. “I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan.” Earlier this month, the Guardian recorded a live online talk in which Faisal condemned others for not supporting Isis. During his 45-minute talk delivered from Jamaica, Faisal was heard saying: “Instead of embracing the Islamic State, supporting the Islamic State and doing everything humanly possible for the success of the state … all they do is slander the mujahideen,” he said. The scholar, who has a reputation for describing many Muslim groups as heretics who should be condemned to death, recently tweeted that Isis was a punishment from Allah for “all fake Muslims who don’t want Islam”. He has described women captured by Isis militants during the conflict as the “spoils of war”. Towards the end of the video, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, Faisal warns Isis of the consequences of killing Henning: “Killing him has no blessing, it will backfire on the Islamic State in a very bad way, the damage will not be able to be repaired.”","bodyHtml":"<p>A radical Islamic preacher who spent four years in a UK jail for soliciting murder and hate speech has made a video plea for Islamic State (Isis) to spare the life of British hostage Alan Henning.</p> <p>Abdullah el-Faisal, who is said to have played a part in radicalising the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is one the most radical English-speaking preachers to publicly call for Henning’s release.</p> <p>The one-time imam of south London’s Brixton mosque has been a fervent online champion of Isis, even supporting the kidnapping and rape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\" title=\"\">Yazidi minority women</a> in Iraq.</p> <p>In the video released on Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNKt1UqDPL4\" title=\"\">Faisal begged for Henning’s life</a> and said that to kill him would be against Islamic law.</p> <p>There are growing signs that the kidnap of Henning is controversial even among Islamic extremists who have been sympathetic to Isis’s tactics.

Colin Livesey said on Tuesday he was concerned that the action could prompt Isis to move Henning and make his whereabouts unknown once more. “I don’t want to lose the faith in knowing he’s coming home,” he told ITV News. The United States had made the first air strikes on Syria overnight, with one of the areas reportedly hit being Raqqa – the Isis stronghold where Henning is believed to be held. Livesey described his brother-in-law as an “amazing bloke … a genuine, down-to-earth guy” who was a loving husband and father to his two children. “He thought he was doing the right thing by going up there and helping other people in another country, to give them aid, because that’s the sort of guy he is … he doesn’t deserve what’s happening to him now,” he said. “He’s so passionate about what he does and that makes us so proud of him. To do it at Christmas, to miss his own family Christmas to go to Syria, speaks volumes of what a man he is.” David Cameron, who is in New York attending the United Nations’ annual gathering of world leaders, has backed the air strikes. They were ordered by the US president, Barack Obama, after intelligence reports indicated that an attack by an organisation linked to al-Qaida called the Khorasan group was “imminent”. The prime minister is using the two-day meeting to muster support for international action against Isis and to discuss Britain’s contribution to the US-led coalition. Cameron is also expected to speak with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani – the first meeting between a British prime minister and a leader of Iran since the revolution of 1979 – in an attempt to enlist Tehran’s support. Obama has said the US will “do what’s necessary” to tackle the militants. Support for the campaign by five Arab states – Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates – underlined the support he was building for international action against Isis, the president said.","bodyHtml":"<p>The brother-in-law of Alan Henning, the British aid volunteer kidnapped by Islamic State in 2012, has spoken of his fears over US air strikes in Syria aimed at the militants’ strongholds.</p> <p>Colin Livesey said on Tuesday he was concerned that the action could prompt Isis to move Henning and make his whereabouts unknown once more. “I don’t want to lose the faith in knowing he’s coming home,” he told ITV News.</p> <p>The United States had made the first air strikes on Syria overnight, with one of the areas reportedly hit being Raqqa – the Isis stronghold where Henning is believed to be held.</p> <p>Livesey described his brother-in-law as an “amazing bloke … a genuine, down-to-earth guy” who was a loving husband and father to his two children.</p> <p>“He thought he was doing the right thing by going up there and helping other people in another country, to give them aid, because that’s the sort of guy he is … he doesn’t deserve what’s happening to him now,” he said.</p> <p>“He’s so passionate about what he does and that makes us so proud of him.

It then depicts Haines' murder by beheading.</p><p>The killer's voice and his distinctive London accent suggest that he is the man who was previously responsible for the video-taped murders of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. At the end of the two-and-a-half minute film, the killer is shown holding a distraught Henning by the collar of the orange jumpsuit in which he is dressed. Indicating towards his captive with his knife, the killer says: \"If you, Cameron, persist in fighting the Islamic State, then you, like your master Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands.\"</p><p>His abduction is said to have distressed members of the group of amateur aid workers who organised the convoy, and angered some members of the Muslim communities in which they live, with accusations that a non-Muslim should never have been allowed to join the mission because of the risk. It was his second trip to Syria – a first visit nine months earlier had been trouble-free.</p><p>Henning was among a group of volunteers who raised money to purchase medical equipment, including defibrillators, stethoscopes and oxygen, and former NHS ambulances, for a hospital at Idlib, in north-west Syria.</p><p>After helping to raise the funds, he is said to have insisted on joining the convoy rather than spend Christmas with his wife and two teenage children at their home in Eccles, Greater Manchester.</p><p>One of the organisers, Kasim Jameel, a taxi driver from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said \"Alan is a man who is full of compassion and we are just praying to Allah that he is released safe and sound.</p><p>\"We are liaising with the authorities and we do not want to say anything which might put him in any further jeopardy or which will inflame the situation. I could tell a lot of stories about the good that Alan has done and about how, as a non Muslim, he has helped Muslims who have suffered in the conflict.</p><p>\"He is motivated to help others – not just by helping the convoy but by loads of other things as well.</p><p>\"He is the nicest of nice guys who has done so much to help other people. He is just a normal bloke, an everyday taxi driver who wanted to do good. We are thinking about him all the time and praying that he will be allowed home to his family.\"</p><p>The convoy set off from Bolton on 20 December, last year, with Jameel, <a href=\"http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/10895378.Convoy_in_mercy_trip_to_war_torn_Syria/\" title=\"\">telling his local newspaper</a>, the Bolton News, that they had been inspired by the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/20/abbas-khan-death-syria-family\" title=\"\">Abbas Khan</a>, an orthopaedic surgeon from London, who died in Syrian government custody earlier that year.</p><p>It was the second convoy organised by the same group: the previous March its members joined a group of Muslims from Scotland to take seven ambulances, medical equipment and baby milk to Idlib.</p><p>A BBC journalist who met Henning while making a documentary about aid convoys to Syria described him as a likeable and amusing man.</p><p>Catrin Nye said he told her that he had been deeply moved by his first trip to Syria. \"It had been a life changing experience,\" she said. \"He had handed out the goods. He described holding the children ... and how that really affected him. He told me he had to go back.\"</p><p>This year, however, British Muslims carrying aid to Syria have fallen under some suspicion, and the UK government is warning against travel to the country under any circumstances.</p><p>Jameel has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28104499\" title=\"\">been advised</a> by police at Dover, Kent, against travelling to Syria, while the Charity Commission has warned that material carried by aid convoys may be abused for non-charitable purposes. Police have been distributing leaflets to volunteers suggesting that they should make contributions instead to established charities, and have visited some volunteers at their homes, asking them not to travel.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9522408","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2158291","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<p>Henning was taken by gunmen after joining a group of Muslim friends on an aid convoy to Syria to deliver medical equipment</p>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Alan Henning: Isis hostage described as 'a big man with a big heart'","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Ian Cobain","commentable":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/14/1410723078570/Iraq-conflict-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"1","internalStoryPackageCode":"78950","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-17T19:31:47Z","standfirst":"Henning was taken by gunmen after joining a group of Muslim friends on an aid convoy to Syria to deliver medical equipment","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-09-15T14:05:41Z","internalContentCode":"447151411"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/14/alan-henning-isis-syria-hostage-aid-worker","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/14/alan-henning-isis-syria-hostage-aid-worker","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-447224795","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/14/1410723070809/Iraq-conflict-001.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","displayCredit":"true","source":"PA","photographer":"Family Handout","altText":"Iraq conflict","suppliersReference":"POLITICS_Terror_161922.JPG","height":"54","credit":"Family Handout/PA","caption":"Alan Henning is being held hostage by Isis - his life was threatened in the cvideo in which they beheaded David Haines.

Obviously, if we knew where he was, we would be able to look at all sorts of options but we don't know where he is.</p><p>\"We have considered every possible option to support these kidnap victims – both British and others – and if we knew where they were, it would be a different story.\"</p><p>Hammond said officials had explained to Henning's family the limited options open to the UK government, whose policy is not to pay ransoms: \"They understand, because we have explained to them in detail, the limitations of our abilities. We are dealing with a very barbaric organisation whose values are completely different from ours.\"</p><p>Analysts said the admission by Hammond may also mean that intelligence services do not know the location of the masked man with a British accent who has fronted the videos showing the beheading of two American journalists and of British aid worker David Haines, which was released on Saturday.</p><p>On Monday, Haines's teenage daughter, Bethany, posted a Facebook message saying she had been touched by the support she had received. She wrote: \"Hi, I'm David's daughter who lives in Perth I was really touched by the messages of support during this hard time I know my dad would be really touched and grateful.\"</p><p>Michael Scheuer, whose service with the CIA saw him lead its Osama bin Laden unit and serve with its directorate of intelligence  and directorate of operations, said the British-speaking militant responsible for Haines's death was likely to be close to the hostages.</p><p>Scheuer said: \"If they are going to use him as a prop, if the hostages are still alive, he probably will be close by for when they next want to kill somebody. My guess is they don't know where 'Jihadi John' is, or the other hostage takers.\"</p><p>British officials have said they were making progress on identifying the masked militant with the London accent seen in the last three videos.</p><p>The hunt to locate Henning, and to track down his captors, is being led by the UK's foreign intelligence service, MI6, with GCHQ, the UK's centre for eavesdropping on electronic communications, assisting. Western human intelligence assets on the ground near Raqqa in Syria, where the hostages may be being held, are sparse.</p><p>A previous US attempt to rescue hostages led to a raid which failed to locate the captives. It came about from details provided by hostages whom Isis had released after ransoms were paid, and this fact became public.</p><p>Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said: \"Hostage rescue, deep in enemy-held territory, is very difficult. This is needle in a haystack stuff.\"</p><p>Scheuer said the Isis hostage takers had proved themselves to be disciplined in not providing electronic clues that US and UK intelligence could use to identify where the captives are being held.</p><p>In the UK, counter-terrorism investigators are trying to locate associates of the militant with the British accent, and Scheuer believes they are likely to know his identity. But, Scheuer pointed out that in recent times those behind public beheadings have rarely been captured and brought to justice.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9525254","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-09-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2158918","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Defence secretary says officials have spoken in depth to the family of 47-year-old, whom group has threatened  to murder","allowUgc":"false","headline":"MI6 does not know where Isis hostage Alan Henning is held, says UK","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Vikram Dodd","commentable":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/15/1410807322449/Alan-Henning-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"13","internalStoryPackageCode":"78950","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-18T19:05:51Z","standfirst":"Defence secretary says officials have spoken in depth to the family of 47-year-old, whom group has threatened  to murder","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-09-15T23:47:27Z","internalContentCode":"447252588"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/15/mi6-isis-hostage-alan-henning-uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/15/mi6-isis-hostage-alan-henning-uk","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-447252933","relation":"thumbnail","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/15/1410807322449/Alan-Henning-004.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","displayCredit":"true","source":"AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Alan Henning","suppliersReference":"DV1866970","height":"84","credit":"AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Alan Henning's family have been told that the options open to the UK government, whose policy is not to pay ransoms, are limited.
