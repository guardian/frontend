        "body":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyslapper/status/374940323115327488\" title=\"\">'Can somebody just put me out of my misery and tell me if this is a made-up name,</a>\" tweeted Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, after an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/03/40-days-of-dating-date-a-friend\" title=\"\">article on dating</a> I wrote last week. Suzanne Moore, more charitably, though possibly sarcastically,  said I had a \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suzanne_moore/status/374923115706339328\" title=\"\">dream byline</a>\". As a young writer trying to scramble into some kind of recognition, appearing on Comment is free should have been a thrilling experience. However, a significant chunk of the online conversation I had sparked was about my name.</p><p>Yes, I am a Slapper. And after nearly 25 years of being one, I have to admit that I love it, even though it does get me into trouble every now and then. I am of course talking about my surname, and not my lifestyle. If you're wondering where Slapper comes from, it's not entirely clear. I've delved into it, but my grandparents reckon it was a classic case of immigration misspelling. My great great grandfather moved to Britain from mainland Europe in the early 20th century. We speculate that the original name was something like <em>Schleperovski</em> – from the Yiddish word \"<em>schlepper</em>\" – a person who carries something laboriously. People still use the word \"schlep\" in that context, to haul something with difficulty.</p><p>My grandmother was pretty lucky. She says that up until about 30 years ago people would only poke very gentle fun at the fact it sounded like \"slap her\". Apparently neither of my grandparents realised that the definition had shifted until they heard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mitchell\" title=\"\">Phil Mitchell</a> use it on an episode of EastEnders. I imagine them sitting there, devastated that our family name was being used to describe, as the Collins dictionary delicately puts it, \"a promiscuous woman\". I can't help but laugh at our misfortune.</p><p>You can just about get away with a name like this if you're male, but unfortunately fate gifted my parents with three daughters. There were some awkward conversations growing up. I remember a particular occasion when, in a crowded restaurant, my father boomed: \"Be proud to be Slappers. you are all Slappers and that is a wonderful and unique thing.\" Not a single head remained unturned.</p><p>In the style of an 80s sitcom protagonist, when introducing myself I often use the catchphrase \"by name, and not by nature!\", with added jazz hands to dispel the awkwardness. Most people  crease up laughing when they hear it. Any semblance of professionalism is immediately abandoned when speaking to bank cashiers, hairdressers, shopkeepers, waiters, publicity teams. The worst is when people actually strain&nbsp;not to laugh, and you worry they'll burst a blood vessel.</p><p>We've all had issues with it. A frazzled teacher threw my sister out of school for wearing a hoody with SLAPPER emblazoned on the back. I also remember baffling a series of substitute teachers who thought I was messing around when I signed the register. My sisters and I have a pretty impressive list of undeserved name-related school punishments. Emails we send are sometimes reported as offensive spam.</p><p>More positively, being a Slapper definitely does make me stand out from the crowd. I've heard from previous bosses that my CV \"popped\" due to the ridiculousness of my name. People remember me more easily, so it's great for building contacts. Unfortunately being taken seriously is another matter entirely.</p><p>When I feel down about it, I try to remember people who are less fortunate than me. American baseball player <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Kuntz\" title=\"\">Rusty Kuntz</a>, for instance, and all the Ben Dovers and Mike Hunts in the world&nbsp;(and let's not forget Jeremy …). There's also Misty Hyman and the Dicks,&nbsp;Cocks, Shitzers, Boners, and something-bottoms who will join me in simultaneously lamenting and yet celebrating our monikers.</p><p>So here is my declaration to the doubters: I am a Slapper, and I am proud. If you're still not convinced, just&nbsp;be thankful that my mother abandoned her plans to name me Fanny.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417404497|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|b73b995063b7ab08b1b4bb0a468535e321dfd878 -->",

The chief medical officer, Janis Orlowski, said one police officer had multiple gunshot wounds to his legs and was undergoing complex surgery. It was unclear whether he would walk again, she said. Two other civilian patients were women: one shot in her shoulder, the other in her head and hand. The second woman's head wound was not serious: \"She is a very, very, lucky young lady,\" Orlowski said.</p><p>There was no indication of a motive. Addressing questions about whether it had been a terrorist attack, the mayor of Washington, Vincent Gray said: \"We don't have any reason to think that at this stage.\"</p><p>On Monday night, officers from the New York police department cordoned off a section of the tree-lined street in Brooklyn, where relatives of Alexis lived in a brownstone apartment.</p><p>The navy yards incident began at about 8.15am, in building 197 of the complex, when many people were having breakfast in the basement cafeteria. A witness, Rick Mason, said a gunman was shooting from a fourth-floor overlook in the hallway outside his office. He said the gunman was aiming down at people in the  cafeteria. Mason said he could hear the shots but could not see a gunman. He said there were multiple levels of security to reach his office. That \"makes me think it might have been someone who works here\", he told the Associated Press.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417501347'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/9/16/1379354019681/Washington-navy-yard-010.jpg' alt='Washington navy yard' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Staff are led to safety from the Washington naval yard. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>A lockdown remained in effect for hours after the shooting. Sailors and civilians assigned to the Washington navy yard, as well as all personnel assigned to the nearby joint base Anacostia-Bolling, were advised to stay put while authorities continued to investigate the scene.</p><p>In the confusion after the attack, police initially feared two other men dressed in \"military-style\" uniform had been involved, and launched a huge manhunt. They issued descriptions of two suspects, one said to have been a white man wearing a navy-style khaki uniform and carrying a pistol, the second described as black and wearing a drab olive military uniform and carrying a rifle.</p><p>One of the suspects was quickly identified and ruled out of the investigation. The second was not eliminated from inquiries until later in the evening. At a 10pm press conference, police said the manhunt was over and lifted remaining restrictions on residents.</p><p>Police in Seattle said Alexis was arrested in 2004 after an incident that he described to detectives as an anger-fuelled \"blackout\". <a href=\"http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2013/09/16/suspect-in-navy-yard-attack-previously-arrested-in-seattle-for-anger-fueled-shooting/\" title=\"\">Two workers on a construction site told police that Alexis walked out of a next-door home on 6 May 2004, pulled a pistol from his waistband and fired three shots into the rear tyres of their parked car</a>.

He had been an \"active participant in rescue attempts on 11 September 2001\", the Seattle police statement said.</p><p>Alexis signed up for the reserves in 2007. In 2010, while he was based at Fort Worth in Texas, he was arrested after discharging a firearm into the ceiling of his upstairs neighbour. Police accepted his explanation that it was an accident, but it appears that the incident led to Alexis's discharge from the navy in 2011.</p><p>After leaving the reserves, Alexis worked as a waiter and delivery driver at the Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement, a suburb of Fort Worth, according to Afton Bradley, a former co-worker, quoted by the Associated Press.</p><p>A former acquaintance, Oui Suthametewakul, said Alexis lived with him and his wife from August 2012 to May 2013 in Fort Worth, but that they had to part ways because he was not paying his bills. Alexis was a \"nice guy\", Suthametewakul said, though he sometimes carried a gun and would frequently complain about being the victim of discrimination.</p><p>Suthametewakul said Alexis had converted to Buddhism and prayed at a local Buddhist temple. Ty Thairintr, who attended Wat Budsaya, a temple in Fort Worth, said: \"We are all shocked. We are nonviolent. Aaron was a very good practitioner of Buddhism. He could chant better than even some of the Thai congregants.\"</p><p>Thairintr said that Alexis told him and others at the temple that he had taken a job as a contractor and he indicated to them he was going to go to Virginia. He last saw Alexis five weeks ago. \"He was a very devoted Buddhist. There was no tell-tale sign of this behaviour,\" Thairintr said.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417501349'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379347651295/Washington-navy-yard-010.jpg' alt='Washington navy yard' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Police respond to the report of a shooting at the naval yard.

It is the likes of Breaking Bad, The Wire and Homeland that are telling us about modern life now, rather than Hollywood's simplified three-act confections. Grand Theft Auto V, however, <em>hints</em> at a future in which that role is taken by games – or at the very least actively sought by them. Unlike the vast swathe of wondrous entertainment the video game industry produces, this series cannot be safely pigeon-holed or ignored by non-players. For the last decade, Rockstar has wielded a sledgehammer over public perceptions of what video games are or can be; now it has struck with merciless force.</p><p>Set mostly within the glitzily superficial city of Los Santos, a warped mirror of Los Angeles, GTA V is a sprawling tale of criminal maniacs self-destructing on a blood-splattered career trajectory to hell. Michael is the middle-aged thug, obsessed with movies, who pulled a witness protection deal with the feds after a failed heist many years ago. When his old partner Trevor, a sociopath who bakes meth out in the desert, turns up in town, the two join forces with a young black kid, Franklin, who's set on leaving his gang-infested neighbourhood behind. The aim is a few final high-paying jobs, but there's a festering resentment between Trev and Michael that goes back a long way, a fizzing fuse that trails all the way through the carnage.</p><p>This three-character format emancipates the narrative, jettisoning the awkward requirement for one protagonist to be everywhere, witnessing everything in this vast world. Switching between the characters can be done at any time while off mission, and all three have their own little pet projects to get involved with, adding variety and a few amusing surprises: switching to Trevor usually involves some bodily function or weird violent episode, while Michael has his dysfunctional family to manage. And overlaying all this is a huge plot about warring government agencies and corrupt billionaires.</p><p>The result is a freewheeling joyride through genre cinema and literature: there are psychotic mafia bosses, insane motorcycle gangs, xenophobically sketched triads, corrupt secret agents and cynical movie producers – their stories twist and interconnect, slithering around the lives of our protagonists. It's dizzying at times, but also daftly compelling, and the influence of multi-strand dramas such as The Wire is obvious.</p><h2>On a mission</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417505079'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379335926701/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Trevor feels the Heat</figcaption></figure><p>GTA veterans will still recognise how the game underneath it all works. There is a backbone of narrative missions that gamers must complete in order to progress, but beyond them is a vast range of dynamic encounters, side-quests and money-making ventures, from buying property to managing clubs and playing the stock exchange (which cleverly reacts to in-game events, allowing you to make extra cash by buying the right shares at the right time). Most story tasks are variations on one theme – drive somewhere, shoot something, drive back – but as with all video game feedback loops, the joy of the system is in the execution. And boy does GTA V execute.</p><p>To say much more would be to ruin the fun of discovery, but rest assured there are insane stunts, there is massive destruction, there is military-grade weaponry, and you will be required to jump out of planes. And helicopters. Combining the sheer scale of the environment with the excellent physics engine, these escapades throw everything at you, from rural bank-heists to jet-ski chases, to operating huge industrial machinery. The bigger heists require mini-preparatory missions (hiding getaway cars, picking novelty masks) which help build the tension, and subtly add to the feeling that what we're all doing here is acting in our own version of Michael Mann's film Heat. While certain ideas are repackaged and chucked straight back at you several times, you're carried along on a rush of euphoric action and shock – mostly because the world looks and behaves as though all this makes sense.</p><h2>Satirical scope</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417505080'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336812314/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: sharp-suited Michael</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, Rockstar North has built an extraordinary universe that functions not only as an exciting, diverse setting but also as a pulverising, nihilistic satire on western society. Reality TV, celebrity magazines, social media, plastic surgery, pop psychology books – all get savaged via the often hilarious commercials on the game's many radio and TV stations. Even games themselves get hit: an advert for Righteous Slaughter 7 promises \"the realistic art of contemporary killing\".</p><p>This isn't just confined to extraneous detail, it slides into the narrative. At one point we see the offices of a giant social network, Lifeinvader, a spot-on amalgam of Facebook, Apple and Google. The staff all wear cargo shorts, whine on about organic lactose-free dairy products and treat their CEO with religious deference. We also get corrupt FBI and CIA agents (called FiB and IAA in the game), trading drugs and manufacturing terrorist threats to keep their budgets topped up. Everyone is on the make, everyone is psychotic, and the game delights in thrusting us into the middle of it as a willing participant.</p><p>Gunfights, meanwhile, are furious, visceral ballets, fuelled by regular visits to the well-stocked Ammu-Nation stores. while GTA has learned a lot about organic environments from Red Dead Redemption (the rural areas of San Andreas are abuzz with wildlife), it has learned its game systems from Max Payne. The combat is ultra-smooth with a variety of decent, functional aiming options and a cover mechanic that works almost imperceptibly – the greatest compliment you can pay to this concept. Limited more by the player's imagination than by ability, most set-piece encounters are not overwhelmingly challenging, but they are spectacular - and this is the point. You have to understand that Grand Theft Auto V is not really a game about story or mechanics, even if it wants to be – it is a game about spectacle and experience.</p><h2>Forgivable flaws</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417505081'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379334561650/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: there's a lot of driving</figcaption></figure><p>This is really important because it allows us to forgive the game's flaws. You have to do a <em>lot</em> of driving. There are no shortcuts, so every mission involves hitting the highways to get to the trigger point; and yes sometimes you think \"Ugh, not another car ride\". Rockstar North has also developed a slightly irritating narrative trope that I'll call \"the exposition expedition\": there are a lot of long journeys that just seem to be there so that the lead characters can chat about back-story, or engage in meandering expletive-drenched conversations on pop culture and psychology – something we probably have Tarantino to thank for.</p><p>Furthermore, the designers don't always make the rules of the system clear. Some missions will only end successfully if you carry out the correct action after a specific prompt, while others don't provide a prompt at all and then fail you if you miss the mandatory sweet spot. The game also has the habit of simultaneously providing mission instructions via in-game dialogue and an on-screen text prompt, which at the very least means you miss plot details, but at the worst means you can be left wondering what the hell you're supposed to do next because you paid attention to the wrong thing. Or at least that was my experience; others may be better at ludological multitasking.</p><p>Women are, once again, relegated to supporting roles as unfaithful wives, hookers and weirdos. The one successful female character in the story is suspected of just wanting to screw her boss. Of course, GTA is essentially an interactive gangster movie, and the genre has a long history of investigating straight male machismo at the expense of all other perspectives, but it would have been wonderful to see Rockstar challenging that convention. It's fine to parody the idiotic misogyny of violent men, but how about doing it by providing their opposite? It seems Rockstar North's all-male writing team is too in thrall to Tarantino and Brett Easton Ellis to really consider this.</p><h2>Seductive vision</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417505082'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336519788/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: Los Santos is glitzily superficial</figcaption></figure><p>Ah but… The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead.</p><p>The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you. You feel every millimetre of the landscape has been thoughtfully handcrafted with the curious gamer in mind. This seems an odd compliment – surely every video game landscape is crafted in this way. But so often, open worlds are built from architectural filler – bland unending landscapes and cardboard box tenements. San Andreas is a state of contrasts and extraordinary detail, there is always some interesting new nook to chance on, some breathtaking previously unexperienced view across the hills toward the capitalist spires of downtown. Designers often talk about rewarding the player for exploration, but usually do so with facile Easter eggs, hidden away in mundane backwaters. From the raging rivers running through the mountain wilderness parks to the beautiful modernist architecture tucked way in the Vinewood hills, Grand Theft Auto V is – like Fallout and Skyrim before it – a form of virtual tourism.</p><p>The talent too is in the emergent moments the system produces. Driving to a violent heist with Don Johnson's Heartbeat playing on the radio, the freeway clear before you; flying a crop-dusting plane up the contour of Mount Chiliad, so that you reach the peak just as the red sun falls, sending rainbows of lens flare through your cockpit screen; clipping a police car during a chase, sending your sports car spinning off the overpass onto the roof of an liquor store. All fun, all about you the player.</p><h2>Complicity and culpability</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417505083'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379336675892/GTA-5-screenshot-008.jpg' alt='GTA 5 screenshot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>GTA 5: explosive action</figcaption></figure><p>And however familiar the GTA set-up is, it still works. Blasting your way out of impossible face-offs with private armies, streaking through the city streets in a new car – some will hate the sheer amorality, the relentless seething darkness of the narrative. <strong>[Spoiler]</strong> Many too will be horrified by an interactive torture scene that pushes the player to perform acts of cruelty on a defenceless victim <strong>[spoiler ends]</strong>. But GTA is all about complicity and culpability – what is the player prepared to do in this world? How much are they responsible for? During the game, Michael makes several visits to a shrink, complaining that he feels someone else is controlling him. Rockstar wants to interrogate the relationship between player and game – or at least snigger at the psychopolitics of it all.</p><p>Yes, some people will hate GTA V. Some, like me, will thoroughly enjoy it while acknowledging its complications, its shortcomings as a narrative adventure. Last of Us says more about humanity in five minutes than GTA V does in its 70-plus missions. Five stars for such a troubled proposition? That'll confuse and anger a few people, I know it. But no one constructs worlds like Rockstar and this one is worth many, many hours of exploration. It is fun, so much guilty, ridiculous fun. It is beautiful to look at, it is jammed with ideas, and when the free add-on, Grand Theft Auto Online, comes out in October, it will offer a compelling multiplayer experience, where participants combine and face off in gigantic turf wars.</p><p>And then GTA V is also a monstrous parody of modern life – our bubbling cesspit of celebrity fixation, political apathy and morose self-obsession. I half expected it to end with the Houser brothers dressed as Papa Lazarou from League of Gentlemen staring into the camera and whispering seductively, \"you all live in Los Santos now\". But they don't need to, of course. This misanthropic masterpiece says it all for them.</p><p><em>Tested on Xbox 360.

        "body":"<p><strong>Last week, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/sep/05/russell-brand-nazi-hugo-boss-charles-moore\" title=\"\"><strong>Russell Brand was in hot water again after cracking a Nazi joke</strong></a><strong> at the expense of GQ award sponsors, Hugo Boss. Here, he gives his side of the story:</strong></p><p>I have had the privilege of scuba diving. I did it once on holiday, and I'm aware that it's one of those subjects that people can get pretty boring and sincere about, and sincerity, for we British, is no state in which to dwell, so I'll be brief. The scuba dive itself was nuministic enough, a drenched heaven; coastal shelves and their staggering, sub-aquatic architecture, like spilt cathedrals, gormless, ghostly fish gliding by like Jackson Pollock's pets. Silent miracles. What got me, though, was when I came up for air, at the end. As my head came above water after even a paltry 15 minutes in Davy Jones's Locker, there was something absurd about the surface. How we, the creatures of the land, live our lives, obliviously trundling, flat feet slapping against the dust.</p><p>It must have been a while since I've attended a fancy, glitzy event, because as soon as I got to the GQ awards I felt like something was up. The usual visual grammar was in place – a carpet in the street, people in paddocks awaiting a brush with something glamorous, blokes with earpieces, birds in frocks of colliding colours that if sighted in nature would indicate the presence of poison. I'm not trying to pass myself off as some kind of Francis of Assisi, Yusuf Islam, man of the people, but I just wasn't feeling it. I ambled into the Opera House across yet more outdoor carpets, boards bearing branding, in this case Hugo Boss, past paparazzi, and began to queue up at the line of journalists and presenters, in a slightly nicer paddock who offer up mics and say stuff like:</p><p>\"Who are you wearing?\"</p><p>\"I'm not wearing anyone. I went with clobber, I'm not Buffalo Bill.\"</p><p>Noel Gallagher was immediately ahead of me in the press line and he's actually a mate. I mean, I love him: sometimes I forget he wrote Supersonic and played to 400,000 people at Knebworth because he's such a laugh. He laid right into me, the usual gear: \"What the fook you wearing? Does Rod Stewart know you're going through his jumble?\" I try to remain composed and give as good as I get, even though the paddock-side banter is accompanied by looming foam-tipped eavesdroppers, hanging like insidious mistletoe.</p><p>In case you don't know, these parties aren't like real parties. It's fabricated fun, imposed from the outside. A vision of what squares imagine cool people might do set on a spaceship. Or in Moloko. As we come out of the lift there's a bloody great long corridor flanked by gorgeous birds in black dresses, paid to be there, motionless, left hand on hip, teeth tacked to lips with scarlet glue. The intention, I suppose, is to contrive some Ian Fleming super-uterus of well fit mannequins to midwife you into the shindig, but me and my mate Matt just felt self-conscious, jigging through Robert Palmer's oestrogen passage like aspirational Morris dancers. Matt stared at their necks and I made small talk as I hot stepped towards the pre-show drinks. Now, I'm not typically immune to the allure of objectified women, but I am presently beleaguered by a nerdish, whirling dervish, and am eschewing all others. Perhaps the clarity of this elation has awakened me. A friend of mine said: \"Being in love is like discovering a concealed ballroom in a house you've long inhabited.\" I also don't drink, so these affairs where most people rinse away their Britishness and twitishness with booze are for me a face-first log flume of backslaps, chitchat, eyewash and gak.</p><p>After a load of photos and what-not, we descend the world's longest escalator, which are called that even as they de-escalate, and in we go to the main forum, a high ceilinged hall, full of circular cloth-draped, numbered tables, a stage at the front, the letters GQ, 12-foot high in neon at the back; this aside, though, neon forever the moniker of trash, this is a posh do, in an opera house full of folk in tuxes.</p><p>Everywhere you look there's someone off the telly; Stephen Fry, Pharrell, Sir Bobby Charlton, Samuel L Jackson, Rio Ferdinand, Justin Timberlake, foreign secretary William Hague and mayor of London Boris Johnson. My table is a sanctuary of sorts; Noel and his missus Sara, John Bishop and his wife Mel, my mates Matt Morgan, Mick and Gee. Noel and I are both there to get awards and decide to use our speeches to dig each other out. This makes me feel a little grounded in the unreal glare, normal.</p><p>Noel's award is for being an \"icon\" and mine for being an \"oracle\". My knowledge of the classics is limited, but includes awareness that an oracle is a spiritual medium through whom prophecies from the gods were sought in ancient Greece. Thankfully, I have a sense of humour that prevents me from taking accolades of that nature on face value, or I'd've been in the tricky position of receiving the GQ award for being \"best portal to a mystical dimension\", which is a lot of pressure. Me, Matt and Noel conclude it's probably best to treat the whole event as a bit of a laugh and, as if to confirm this as the correct attitude, Boris Johnson – a man perpetually in pyjamas regardless of what he's wearing – bounds to the stage to accept the award for \"best politician\". Yes, we agree: this is definitely a joke.</p><p>Boris, it seems, is taking it in this spirit, joshing beneath his ever-redeeming barnet that Labour's opposition to military action in Syria is a fey stance that he, as GQ politician of the year, would never be guilty of.</p><p>Matt is momentarily focused. \"He's making light of gassed Syrian children,\" he says. We watch, slightly aghast, then return to goading Noel.</p><p>Before long, John Bishop is on stage giving me a lovely introduction, so I get up as Noel hurls down a few gauntlets, daring me to \"do my worst\".</p><p>I thanked John, said the \"oracle award\" sounds like a made-up prize you'd give a fat kid on sports day – I should know, I used to get them – then that it's barmy that Hugo Boss can trade under the same name they flogged uniforms to the Nazis under and the ludicrous necessity for an event such as this one to banish such a lurid piece of information from our collective consciousness.</p><p>I could see the room dividing as I spoke. I could hear the laughter of some and louder still silence of others. I realised that for some people this was regarded as an event with import. The magazine, the sponsors and some of those in attendance saw it as a kind of ceremony that warranted respect. In effect, it is a corporate ritual, an alliance between a media organisation, GQ, and a commercial entity, Hugo Boss. What dawned on me as the night went on is that even in apparently frivolous conditions the establishment asserts control, and won't tolerate having that assertion challenged, even flippantly, by that most beautifully adept tool: comedy.</p><p>The jokes about Hugo Boss were not intended to herald a campaign to destroy them. They're not Monsanto or Halliburton, the contemporary corporate allies of modern-day fascism; they are, I thought, an irrelevant menswear supplier with a double-dodgy history. The evening, though, provided an interesting opportunity to see how power structures preserve their agenda, even in a chintzy microcosm.</p><p>Subsequent to my jokes, the evening took a peculiar turn. Like the illusion of sophistication had been inadvertently disrupted by the exposure. It had the vibe of a wedding dinner where the best man's speech had revealed the groom's infidelity. With Hitler.</p><p>Foreign secretary William Hague gave an award to former Telegraph editor Charles Moore, for writing a hagiography of Margaret Thatcher, who used his acceptance speech to build a precarious connection between my comments about the sponsors, my foolish answerphone scandal at the BBC and the Sachs family's flight, 70 years earlier, from Nazi-occupied Europe. It was a confusing tapestry that Moore spun but he seemed to be saying that a) the calls were as bad as the Holocaust and b) the Sachs family may not've sought refuge in Britain had they known what awaited them. Even for a man whose former job was editing the Telegraph this is an extraordinary way to manipulate information.</p><p>Noel, who is not one to sit quietly on his feelings, literally booed while Charles Moore was talking, and others joined in. Booing! When do you hear booing in this day and age other than pantomimes and parliament? Hague and Johnson are equally at home in either (Widow Twanky and Buttons, obviously) so were not unduly ruffled, but I thought it was nuts. The room by now had a distinct feel of \"us and them\" and if there is a line drawn in the sand I don't ever want to find myself on the same side as Hague and Johnson. Up went Noel to garner his gong and he did not disappoint: \"Always nice to be invited to the Tory party conference,\" he began, \"Good to see the foreign secretary present when there's shit kicking off in Syria.\"</p><p>Noel once expressed his disgust at seeing a politician at Glastonbury. \"What are you doing here? This ain't for you,\" he'd said. He explained to me: \"You used to know where you were with politicians in the 70s and 80s cos they all looked like nutters: Thatcher, Heseltine, Cyril Smith. Now they look normal, they're more dangerous.\" Then, with dreadful foreboding: \"They move among us.\" I agree with Noel. What are politicians doing at Glastonbury and the GQ awards? I feel guilty going, and I'm a comedian. Why are public officials, paid by us, turning up at events for fashion magazines? Well, the reason I was there was because I have a tour on and I was advised it would be good publicity. What are the politicians selling? How are they managing our perception of them with their attendance of these sequin-encrusted corporate balls?</p><p>We witness that there is a relationship between government, media and industry that is evident even at this most spurious and superficial level. These three institutions support one another. We know that however cool a media outlet may purport to be, their primary loyalty is to their corporate backers. We know also that you cannot criticise the corporate backers openly without censorship and subsequent manipulation of this information.</p><p>Now I'm aware that this was really no big deal; I'm not saying I'm an estuary Che Guevara. It was a daft joke by a daft comic at a daft event. It makes me wonder, though, how the relationships and power dynamics I witnessed on this relatively inconsequential context are replicated on a more significant scale.</p><p>For example, if you can't criticise Hugo Boss at the GQ awards because they own the event, do you think it is significant that energy companies donate to the Tory party? Will that affect government policy? Will the relationships that \"politician of the year\" Boris Johnson has with City bankers – he took many more meetings with them than public servants in his first term as mayor – influence the way he runs our capital?</p><p>Is it any wonder that Amazon, Vodafone and Starbucks avoid paying tax when they enjoy such cosy relationships with members of our government?</p><p>Ought we be concerned that our rights to protest are being continually eroded under the guise of enhancing our safety? Is there a relationship between proposed fracking in the UK, new laws that prohibit protest and the relationships between energy companies and our government?</p><p>I don't know. I do have some good principles picked up that night that are generally applicable: the glamour and the glitz isn't real, the party isn't real, you have a much better time mucking around trying to make your mates laugh. I suppose that's obvious. We all know it, we already know all the important stuff, like: don't trust politicians, don't trust big business and don't trust the media. Trust your own heart and each other. When you take a breath and look away from the spectacle it's amazing how absurd it seems when you look back.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417226011|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|086679234af7ef216057405fa7dab9631eb3a651 -->",

He's a unique talent,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>\"I'll take the Scholes of 2004-2010/11 as the very best: comparable to the Xavis, the Pirlos in his ability to control the tempo of a whole match. It is not just about scoring the goals. People used to ask why Manchester United scored so many late goals, it was because they used to knacker teams for 85 minutes by keeping possession and wore them out.</p><p></p><p>\"To be fair, Steven Gerrard added this to his game over the past two years, but you can't compare. It's like comparing Messi and Ronaldo.\"</p><p></p><p>Carragher responded by asking why Sven Goran Eriksson decided to move Scholes out to the right for England to accommodate Gerrard and Lampard, to which Neville replied it was the \"easy option because Scholes could play there\".</p><p></p><p>Carragher then appeared to hit the winner by asking why Sir Alex Ferguson felt the need to go and buy Juan Sebastián Verón if Scholes was so important, a question Neville could only laugh off.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417503069|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|42aa831cb26f81fb0b0b69dcdc933220fe2926b4 -->",

Ever??!!\" asked another.</p><p>Davuluri, however, brushed aside the negative comments.</p><p>\"I have to rise above that,\" she said. \"I always viewed myself as first and foremost American.\"</p><p>Her grandmother told the Associated Press that she cried when she saw the news on television.</p><p>\"I am very, very, happy for the girl. It was her dream and it was fulfilled,\" 89-year-old V Koteshwaramma said by phone from her home in the city of Vijaywada, in southern India.</p><p>In the run-up to the pageant, much attention was given to Miss Kansas, Theresa Vail, an army sergeant believed to have been the first contestant ever to openly display tattoos. She has the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer\" title=\"\">Serenity Prayer</a> on her rib cage, and a smaller military insignia on the back of one shoulder.</p><p>Vail won a nationwide \"America's choice\" vote to advance as a semi-finalist, but failed to make it into the top 10.</p><p>In a Twitter message on Sunday before the finals began, Vail wrote: \"Win or not tonight, I have accomplished what I set out to do. I have empowered women. I have opened eyes.\"</p><p>The pageant pitted 53 contestants – one from each state, plus Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands – in swimming wear, evening gown, talent and interview competitions.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417380150|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|b63367585afbfa34295dda7fcdc6a4f6784fe016 -->",

        "headline":"Champions League 2013-14: 10 things we are looking forward to",
        "body":"<h2>So just how special are you this time, José?</h2><p>José Mourinho has spent the first few months since his return to Chelsea stressing how he is overseeing a young team in transition, as if offering the world a reminder that any silverware claimed this term should constitute a bonus rather than a necessity. Yet, as a manager who has claimed all the domestic trophies on offer, the chance to claim a European Cup for the London club will be enticing. It would be his third, after those won with Porto and Internazionale, and he would surely delight in achieving at Stamford Bridge what he could not quite manage with Real Madrid. Chelsea appear to have a formality of a group, and will remember what can be achieved in this competition against the odds after their own triumph in 2012. They will draw encouragement, too, from their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/30/chelsea-bayern-munich-super-cup\" title=\"\">display in the Super Cup against Bayern Munich</a>. Yet whether they would be able to impose their fluent, attack-minded style on another of Europe's heavyweights – rather than seeking solely to soak up opposition pressure and hit on the counter, as they did in Prague against Bayern – remains to be seen. Expect Mourinho to play down their chances at first. \"The Champions League cannot be an obsession for me,\" he said in pre-season. \"I've won it twice, and would be happy to win it again, but Chelsea have won it too. So it's not an obsession. Let's work and, with the quality we have, we'll be there fighting for that objective.\" Come the spring, that outlook may alter. <strong>DF</strong></p><p></p><h2>Manchester City: surely they can't make such of a mess of it again?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Manuel Pellegrini signalled the intent of Manchester City to push through the Champions League group stage for the first time in three years with the side he selected for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/15/stoke-mark-hughes-manchester-city\" title=\"\">Saturday's goalless draw at Stoke City</a>. The Chilean rested Sergio Agüero, Joleon Lescott, Fernandinho and Jesús Navas as he looks to plot a path past Bayern Munich, CSKA Moscow, and the Czech champions Viktoria Plzen, whom City encounter on Tuesday evening at the Doosan Arena. Pellegrini claims no particular mention was made of the competition in which City have bombed in their first two attempts before he was named as Roberto Mancini's successor as manager. Yet his pedigree in leading an unheralded Villarreal to the 2006 semi-finals (where Arsenal defeated them) and Málaga to last year's quarter-finals, before Borussia Dortmund <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/09/borussia-dortmund-malaga-champions-league\" title=\"\">eliminated them so dramatically</a>, was a prime factor when the club's grandees considered his candidacy. So far City have stuttered, losing at Cardiff City and dropping those two points at Stoke. Against the Gambrinus Liga champions, a draw would be acceptable, but a defeat would recall the unwanted memories of those past two Champions League failures. <strong>JJ </strong></p><p></p><h2>No Özil but how will Bale and Isco fare at the Bernabéu?</h2><p>At the start of the 2009-10 season, Real Madrid sold Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder. The decision was taken over the head of the coach, Manuel Pellegrini, but the headline on the cover of one newspaper did the president's bidding for him and declared: \"Well sold.\" At the end of the season, the European Cup final was held at the Santiago Bernabéu. Real Madrid were not there; Sneijder and Robben were. Like Samuel Eto'o, another man Madrid let go, they have won trebles but Madrid have not. At the time, Arsène Wenger joked that it was worth hanging round outside the Bernabéu to pick up who they had thrown out. Prophetic words. Arsenal are entitled to be hugely excited about Mesut Özil. Madrid's fans did not want him to be sold and nor did Madrid's players, and the decision is questionable to say the least, but there is a certain logic to it. His departure pays half of Gareth Bale's arrival fee and this year there is someone else in his position whose promise is gigantic. Creative, clever and growing in importance, Isco could prove to be one of the players in Europe in his second season in the Champions League, having helped Málaga to within 30 seconds of last year's semi-final. <strong>SL</strong></p><p></p><h2>Arsenal always get out of the group – maybe not this year</h2><p>Arsène Wenger's record with Arsenal, not only in reaching the Champions League but also in negotiating a passage out of the group stages, remains remarkable even if it is hard to contemplate his current squad having the depth of quality to break the manager's own personal duck in terms of European trophies this season. Indeed, so daunting does Group F appear that even progress from the section would constitute an achievement. Borussia Dortmund, last season's runners-up, and Napoli represent considerable threats, and it says much that Marseille – no mugs themselves – appear to be the whipping boys elect. Wednesday night at the Stade Vélodrome will go a long way towards determining whether that is an accurate assessment, particularly with Wenger's options limited by early season injuries. Yet this is an intriguing group, the type to draw the focus with every collision so enthralling. Should Arsenal emerge into the second phase, the resultant boost in confidence could conceivably propel their domestic challenge. <strong>DF</strong></p><p></p><h2>Rafael Benítez is back in the tournament he loves the most</h2><p>Even in their late-1980s Diego Maradona inspired heyday, when they won two Serie A titles in four years, Napoli made little impression in Europe's elite competition. They are hoping that will change this season, having appointed a manager in the summer whose love affair with European is well-documented. Rafael Benítez led Valencia to Uefa Cup success in 2004, and then improbably took Liverpool to their Champions League victory a year later. Two seasons on Liverpool lost to Milan in Athens but the way the Spaniard masterminded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/15/chelsea-benfica-europa-league-final-live\" title=\"\">Chelsea's Europa League triumph back in May</a> provided plenty of evidence to suggest his magic touch in European competition has not waned. Having finished second in Serie A last season, when manager Walter Mazzarri's defection to Internazionale was followed by the sale of Edinson Cavani to PSG for £55m it seemed the Stadio San Paolo was set for a season of transition. But Benítez has reinvested the Cavani cash wisely, most eye-catchingly on tempting Gonzalo Higuaín from Real Madrid for £34m from under the noses of Arsenal, but also on two more players from the Bernabéu, Raúl Albiol and José Callejón.  Add in the talents of Croatian playmaker Marek Hamsik and the on-loan Pepe Reina, and Benítez has a squad to compete in what will be a fiercely contested Group F. They have won all three games in Serie A to top the early-season table. Arsenal, and Dortmund, who travel to Naples on Wednesday, have been warned. <strong>PC</strong></p><p></p><h2>New Spanish kids on the block</h2><p></p><p>Few teams have been as fun to watch as Real Sociedad over the past year and, although they lost their midfield playmaker Asier Illarramendi to Real Madrid for €39m (£33m) and spent the final days of the transfer window fearing the continent's biggest clubs coming to take  their best talents, he was the only significant player to depart. Up front they have a dynamism and daring about them that few sides can match. They went to Lyon and scored two ridiculously good goals to cruise through the qualifier. Imanol Agirretxe now has competition from Haris Seferovic in the centre-forward position – he it was who belted in the second at the Stade Gerland – Carlos Vela and Antoine Griezmann are swift and skilful on either side of the attack and then in the middle there is the captain, Xabi Prieto, the man whose coach claimed he should have been a Spain regular even when he was playing in the second division. Smooth and seemingly slow, mentally he is faster than anyone. Class. <strong>SL</strong></p><p></p><h2>Moyes's big test: how will United play in Europe?</h2><p></p><p>For obvious reasons, Manchester United's Champions League campaign is one heaving with intrigue. Sir Alex Ferguson is no longer around and in his place comes a man with no experience whatsoever at this level. In the circumstances, a club that has reached three of the past five finals are not expected by many to go so far this year, yet there remains pressure on Moyes to make an impact. United's group is not the easiest, containing as it does Bayer Leverkusen, who finished a point behind the much-heralded Borussia Dortmund in last season's Bundesliga, the Ukrainian champions, Shakhtar Donetsk, who reached last 16 of last season's Champions League, and a very talented Real Sociedad side. United's players have what it takes to finish above all three teams but the big question is how their manager sets them up to play, both home and away. Moyes often displayed caution an naivety when leading in Everton in Europe – he now must be bolder and wiser. <strong>SN </strong></p><p></p><h2>PSG: Contenders or big-money pretenders?</h2><p>It would feel perverse to describe a club who have spent as lavishly as Paris Saint-Germain as dark horses, even in this competition, so PSG should now be considered contenders for the Champions League this term. Laurent Blanc has seen the Parisians' Qatari owners recruit a mouth-watering array of forward options: the reputations of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani precede them, though incorporating that pair with a supply line constructed from a combination from Ezequiel Lavezzi, Lucas, Marco Verratti, Jérémy Ménez and Javier Pastore will represent a tantalising selection challenge. The former France manager has wonderful players from which to choose, and a more experienced defence upon whom to rely, and will aspire to better last season's hugely encouraging campaign which stretched into the quarter-finals, when Carlo Ancelotti's team only exited on away goals to Barcelona. This year, with Monaco emerging as a rival moneyed force in the domestic game, expectations are raised at the Parc des Princes. PSG, with a relatively comfortable looking group ahead, can hope to prosper. <strong>DF</strong></p><p></p><h2>Can Kaká revive Milan's glory days?</h2><p>The news that Kaká has damaged his thigh and is likely to be out of action for at least a month is a blow for those excited by his return to Milan and keen to see how he would perform for them in Europe. The Brazilian inspired the Italians to the 2005 final in Istanbul – where for the first 45 minutes he was simply too brilliant for Liverpool to handle – and then to ultimate victory in Athens two years later, when Liverpool were again the opponents but this time defeated. The playmaker could well be back for Barcelona's visit to San Siro on 22 October and until then Milan-watchers can take delight from watching Robinho, Mario Balotelli and Alessandro Matri, who returned from Juventus last month, perform for the Rossoneri. <strong>SN</strong></p><p></p><h2>Guardiola at Bayern: a tough act to follow</h2><p>Pep Guardiola knows a thing or two about managing expectations – and defeating Chelsea and Mourinho to win the Super Cup was not a bad start – but just how does he go about matching Bayern's Wembley triumph from last season? The fact that Jupp Heynckes' side also completed a domestic double has only increased the pressure on Guardiola, but  Bayern have started the Bundesliga season well, winning four out of five, and the holders will be expected to see off CSKA Moscow at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday. While the acquisition of Mario Götze from Dortmund was their headlining summer arrival, the capture of Guardiola's former Barcelona prodigy Thiago Alcântara was perhaps equally significant, even if knee ligament damage suffered on his debut has ruled the Spaniard out until November. With trusted members of the squad who reached successive finals such as Luiz Gustavo, Mario Gomez and Ukraine's captain, Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, allowed to leave, Guardiola will hope his resources are not too stretched in a group where the two games with Manchester City, and another former rival in Manuel Pellegrini, are the most eye-catching. In some senses not much has changed for Guardiola since his Camp Nou days: anything short of lifting the trophy in Lisbon next May will be regarded as failure. <strong>PC</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417423547|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|f6b944f1f813feb96049ea0aae6bdcc0ae502544 -->",

        "headline":"Liverpool confounded as Jonjo Shelvey is Swansea's sinner then saint",
        "body":"<p>Liverpool lost their 100% record but Daniel Sturridge kept his and the England striker's fourth goal in as many games helped to take his team back to the summit of the Premier League after a thrilling rollercoaster ride against improving Swansea.</p><p>Sturridge will be the focus of media attention, a week after missing England's World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Ukraine, but he was joined in the spotlight last night by Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey who, playing against his old club, scored the first goal after only two minutes, gave away two with ruinous passes and was booked for clashing with the equally competitive Lucas Leiva, with whom he once shared the same midfield.</p><p>While the red legions were still digesting the changes to their lineup, which brought in Mamadou Sakho in place of Daniel Agger in central defence and Victor Moses to the exclusion of Iago Aspas in attack, both teams scored, leaving it 1-1 after just four pell-mell minutes.</p><p>Swansea thought they had the initiative after two, when Shelvey got away from Sakho, only for the Frenchman to get in a recovery tackle that blocked the initial shot.</p><p>Unfortunately for the defender, the ball fell back at Shelvey's feet and he took maximum advantage, driving it handsomely past Simon Mignolet, right to left, from 12 yards.</p><p>Some initiative. Liverpool were level within a matter of seconds, with Shelvey's night taking a horrible turn for the worse. His dreadful backpass gifted possession to Sturridge, who made it four goals in as many games with a crisp finish from 15&nbsp;yards.</p><p>How England could have done with him against Ukraine. That said, too much was made of the fact that Sturridge was playing after missing last week's World Cup qualifiers for England. Brendan Rodgers had a simple rebuttal for the club v country conspiracy theorists.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417507682'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2013/9/16/1379360333767/Swansea-Citys-Jonjo-Shelv-008.jpg' alt='Swansea City's Jonjo Shelvey' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Swansea City's Jonjo Shelvey had a very mixed evening. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA</figcaption></figure><p>Given a week in which to recover, the striker's thigh strain had responded to intensive treatment and he was sufficiently restored to take his place as the focal point of the Liverpool attack. It is a role he has performed with distinction in the continued absence of Luis Suárez, who completes his 10-match suspension at the weekend.</p><p>The last of these matches, at home to Manchester United, sparked familiar talk of an overdue renaissance at Anfield, which has more to do with impatience than genuine belief. Even after investing the thick end of £50m on reinforcements, Liverpool remain less than convincing as title aspirants.</p><p>Shelvey, the erstwhile Liverpool midfielder now with Swansea, opined before the game that England should play more like the Swans. To which Roy Hodgson could reply that he would rather be on top of the table, as England are, than in the bottom three, where the Welsh club currently languish.</p><p>Simplistic? Maybe, but are not we for ever being told that football is a simple game?</p><p>For its audience, however, it must be said that this had everything the Ukraine borefest lacked. Almost absurdly open, play switched from end to end with a regularity more commonly associated with tennis, offering a glut of chances at both ends.</p><p>Wilfried Bony had Mignolet at full stretch from 25 yards, then the Ivorian fired over close in, Jordan Henderson saw a goalbound shot blocked by Ben Davies and Sturridge might have struck again when Moses's left-wing cross set him up for a firm, downward header from six yards, which Michel Vorm repelled with his legs.</p><p>The next goal was therefore delayed until the 37th minute, when Shelvey was again left clutching his head in despairing hands.</p><p>Another misplaced pass by Shelvey, this one in midfield, let in Moses, who ran on with confident purpose to the edge of the D, from where he thumped the ball past Vorm's right hand. The goalkeeper appeared to be unsighted by Ashley Williams's unavailing attempt to block the&nbsp;shot.</p><p>Cut and thrust, punch and counterpunch. Mignolet's save denied a Michu attempt from distance, Nathan Dyer was thwarted at whites-of-the-eyes range by Martin Skrtel's bruising goalline intervention</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417452499|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|182f9eb65f459b4cb760a5e184ed828b0982a304 -->",

One is plastic (or&nbsp;\"beautifully, unapologetically plastic\", in Apple-speak) and comes in five colours, which you can admire for a minute before popping it into its case for all eternity. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/iphone/10307062/iPhone-5C-available-for-pre-order-UK-operators-announce-pricing.html\" title=\"\">At £549 a pop</a>, that's still cheaper than the other model. The iPhone 5s can read your fingerprint, is faster than the previous model and comes in different hues, including grey (officially, \"space grey\") and gold (sadly not \"oligarch gold\"). This makes it the most \"forward-thinking phone\" on the planet, claimed the Californian tech overlords.</p><p>Yet even those hacks who queued up for a few minutes alone with the precious object felt let down. Not '\"wow\", but \"meh\"', <a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57602264-233/five-disappointing-things-about-the-iphone-5s/\" title=\"\">wrote leading gadget blog CNET</a>. No doubt I've missed a few mind-melding features. The fanboys can remind each other what those are as they queue up this weekend, in that traditional consumerist doomloop where the media report on a new Apple product, whipping up punters to buy the product, allowing the media to report on the crowds baying for the product. And in fairness, the new iPhones are updates rather than bold new steps (albeit pricey updates). Then again, treading water is what Apple has done ever since, sadly, it<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/06/steve-jobs-apple-cofounder-dies\" title=\"\"> lost Jobs</a>. Under the turtlenecked-one, we got the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, one after another. Since Cook took over as boss in 2011, there has been reiteration rather than innovation. The iPad, except smaller. Now with a sharper screen. In pink. Ho hum.</p><p>Perhaps the firm will bounce back with some new thing. I'm more inclined to agree with Hartmut Esslinger, an early 80s designer of the Mac, who said this weekend that Cook's company now resembles late-period Sony: <a href=\"http://qz.com/123388/hartmut-esslinger-says-apple-no-longer-innovative-helped-steve-jobs-design-the-mac/\" title=\"\">its executives no longer pioneering</a>, but concentrating on refining products and extracting maximum profit. And if that's right, it's not just tech heads who should be concerned how Britain, America and the west are going to pay their way in the world.</p><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/13/lehman-brothers-collapse\" title=\"\">five years since Lehman Brothers fell over</a>, mainstream politicians of all stripes – Cameron to Obama to Miliband to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/30/mitt-romney-man-behind-permasmile\" title=\"\">Romney</a> – have all agreed on innovation as a kind of economic elixir. Only by designing new products and finding new sources of wealth will the west get out of this slump, runs the standard stump speech. With its combination of newness and private-sector sorcery and job creation, the i-word has become practically a political intoxicant. Yet if the world's richest and most famously innovative company is no longer pumping out the novelties, that suggests governments need to think harder about how and when this wave of innovation is going to burst forth.</p><p>Jobs, remembered Esslinger last weekend, \"stubbornly insisted on trying new things\". In other words, he was a believer in research and development. How else would his team make new products? But where Jobs's  Apple used to spend a lot on R&amp;D, that has now tailed off. According to Colin Haslam at Queen Mary University of London, between 8% and 10% of all the money Apple made from sales would regularly go towards research and development. That's now nearer 2%. This decline is partly the law of large numbers: Apple now sells a load more stuff than it did in the early noughties, so R&amp;D spend would need to go up a lot to keep pace. But, as Haslam points out, the other behemoths of Silicon Valley such as Intel and Microsoft still spend around a 10th of their sales revenue on research. And he notes that Cook's Apple is spending increasing amounts on marketing what it does have rather than coming up with new gizmos.</p><p>That's one big change to the Apple business model. The other is structural. In the early days, Jobs laid a lot of emphasis on making his goods in the US. That's barely the case now: Apple has morphed into a design and retail business that orders in its manufactures from a network of more than 150 companies, usually based abroad. That makes it a more profitable enterprise but it also means that Apple is effectively outsourcing its thinking about production and components to others. In 1999, a pair of organisational academics noted that there was something curious about Jobs's employees: \"People were recruited to Apple with the idea that they would be helping to change the world. Apple was more than a company; it was a cause.\" But what happens to a cause when most of its parts and its software come in from a variety of points scattered far, far away from the Cupertino HQ?</p><p>None of these changes happened overnight in the summer of 2011. It was under Jobs that Cook came to prominence. What seems to be happening to Apple now is a culmination of trends that have been in play for years, and which&nbsp;are no longer being offset.</p><p>But one thing Steve Jobs wouldn't have done is what his successor did this spring: cave into pressure from hedge funds and give the company a $100bn cashpile. When a tech firm starts buying back shares from investors, it's as good an indication as any that it's run out of ideas and oomph. William Lazonick at the University of Massachusetts Lowell says that Apple is no longer a design and product firm, driven by engineers and designers, but a \"financialised\" company focused on returning money to Wall Street. It is, he and a team of academics conclude, \"becoming a typical American corporation\". That's a damning verdict for the company that Jobs built. But it's also worrying in its implications for modern, financial capitalism to deliver innovation.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417444655|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|95e0a8b0fd9b73a42177225ab540aba18c20fa3e -->",

Young received a yellow card after a dive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/15/marouane-fellaini-wayne-rooney-manchester-united\" title=\"\">against Palace on Saturday</a> and Moyes confirmed he had reprimanded his player, just as Sir Alex Ferguson had done when he was manager. \"You can never be sure it won't happen again but I have had a word with him privately,\" Moyes said.</p><p>Moyes has previously fined players at Everton for diving, including Phil Neville, now a member of his backroom staff at Old Trafford, and was outspoken in his criticisms of Luis Suárez – like Young, another with a history of diving – before the Merseyside derby last season.</p><p>\"I have said for many years that we should have retrospective video action against diving,\" Moyes, preparing for United's game against Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday and his first experience of managing in the Champions League, said. \"That would help referees no end. My views haven't changed from when I was&nbsp;at Everton to when I was at Manchester United.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-417459356'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/9/16/1379358935004/David-Moyes-at-Manchester-008.jpg' alt='David Moyes at Manchester United training in preparation for the game against Bayer Leverkusen' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>David Moyes at Manchester United training in preparation for the Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen.  Photograph: Matthew Peters/Man Utd via Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Ferdinand spoke out as a centre-half who believes defenders have had to modify their game because of the increased willingness of forwards to go to ground under any form of contact. \"The forwards are cute. They know how to do this kind of stuff. It is quite a difficult thing to look at and say: 'He dived.' But retrospective viewings and punishments may be the way to go.\"</p><p>The former England international added: \"If it happens, it has to happen across the board. It has to happen across Europe. We are going into the Champions League and, if we are being told we can't dive in our league and then you come across people in other countries who simulate … you don't want people to feel they can con the referee.\"</p><p>Young's yellow card was followed by the same player being involved for the penalty that led to the referee, Jon Moss, sending off Kagisho Dikgacoi. Robin van Persie scored from the spot to put United on their way to a 2-0 win.</p><p>Parish said: \"If preventing a goalscoring opportunity is a straight red then trying to create one by cheating should be a straight red. Ashley Young's dive and the appeal before [involving Patrice Evra] put pressure on the ref to give a subsequent penalty that was certainly outside the area and probably wasn't even a foul.</p><p>\"Ashley Young has a yellow card and three points and we've no points and one less player to pick from for the next game. [It] might have cost us a point that might keep us up. [We] need to get some momentum behind a straight red for a dive.\"</p><p>Young's habit of exaggerated falls has led to widespread criticism of the winger, in particular because of the way he jutted out his leg to try to initiate contact with Dikgacoi. Ashley Cole, another England international, appeared to dive during Chelsea's game at Old Trafford last month and Ferdinand, speaking generally, said it was now commonplace. \"It's become a part of our game that, as defenders we are used to.\"</p><p>Moyes was asked whether he agreed with Parish that the punishment should be upgraded to a red card. \"We can make up all the punishments we like but the rules are there and they are the ones the referees have to abide by,\" he said. \"The referee did what he had to do and gave him a yellow card. The referee got the decision correct, called it right and gave him what punishment he could.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417447679|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|12d8b5b88ae41e20e3cff18b2ac069f83cb1a167 -->",

        "headline":"The Fried Chicken Shop – TV review",
        "body":"<p>One of my favourite London restaurants is Roosters Spot on Clapham High Street. Not sure about the name (something of chickenpox about it, no?) Not sure about the food either to be honest, I've never actually eaten there. I've just looked in once before, when it was the setting for a one-off Cutting Edge film earlier in the year. I liked it then though; other people must have too, because they've come back and we're being served up three more portions of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-fried-chicken-shop\" title=\"\"><strong>The Fried Chicken Shop</strong></a> (Channel 4)</p><p>It's less about the chicken, more about the people of course, both sides of the counter. Like lovely, sweet Imran who's worked there for two years and likes it when the customers behave badly, \"throwing chicken to each other, chips to each other, ketchup. It's very good when the people are doing this<strong> </strong>...\"</p><p>And Imran's best friend Harris, also from Pakistan, also charming. It hasn't worked out exactly the way Harris's mother planned; she wanted him to be a commercial pilot. Yeah, well, flying, frying, what's the difference? And Harris plans to open his own restaurant, an Italian one. Because, it emerges later, he very much likes – loves in fact, and plans to marry – a beautiful Italian waitress called Faviola. All that remains to do is to tell her.</p><p>There's extra love all over Roosters Spot today. Lovey-dovey customers Leah and Tyrone are in love. \"Aren't we?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Love you too.\" They've got plans for roosts and broods of their own, even though they only look about 15 to me. A word of advice: there's plenty of time for that … oops, too late, number one's on its way. Maybe it's something in the chilli sauce.</p><p>CeeCee's been less lucky in love lately. It's been a while, five months, she tells her best mate Lulu. Fast food is frowned on in their \"Arabic kind of homes,\" says Lulu (drinking too, I imagine, which they've been doing all afternoon). But they just love the chicken, everyone does. And next time they're in, CeeCee has got someone in her life again! I'm telling you, this place sorts you out. If you're single and you're in the south London area, you need to get down to Roosters Spot. Well,&nbsp;I am. It may not be the best place to go for an actual date though, because, as someone here says, fried chicken is \"mad unflattering to eat\".</p><p>\"Ah, Indian birds man,\" a posh boy says to his posh friend, eyeing up a group of Asian girls. \"Any day of the week.\" I think they're posh boys. It's hard to tell these days, even in Kingston Upon Bloody Thames they sound like they come from Kingston Jamaica. These ones look posh though, the hair's usually a giveaway.</p><p>One of them is having trouble with the chilli sauce. \"It feels like I'm having a baby, One Born Every Minute,\" he says. And then they too are discussing when they going to settle down and have babies of their own. It's definitely the sauce. Indian-bird-any-day-of-the-week man wants to end up with a nice little four-bed detached place in Suffolk. Maybe he'll keep chickens of his own.</p><p>Last time round I was uncertain about the location of The Fried Chicken Shop. Clapham's too smart, I&nbsp;was thinking. But it's good to have the&nbsp;posh boys (there are other more annoying ones later), for twattery and range. Actually it's perfect, about as wide a spectrum of society as you'll find anywhere. In Clapham, everyone eats&nbsp;chicken – school kids and students, recording artists and buskers,&nbsp;clubbers, shoppers, drinkers, chancers, dancers, jokers, stockbrokers. And Jessie, a 60-year-old cross-dresser in a tiny lime-green miniskirt that doesn't go low enough to cover her pants or high enough to cover her builder's crack. More like a belt than a skirt. And&nbsp;she moans about&nbsp;what other people are wearing!</p><p>It can't have cost very much to make&nbsp;– rigging up a few fixed cameras&nbsp;in a fast-food place, then leaving them to roll for three weeks. Followed by the mother of all editing jobs, to turn it&nbsp;into something, with stories. (I'd like&nbsp;to know a bit more about the making of it actually, like at&nbsp;what point did people know they were being filmed, and how they got&nbsp;consent etc.)</p><p>Anyway, the result is brilliant – not&nbsp;really about what we eat, but about&nbsp;who we are in Britain today. Well, in London certainly. Who we are,&nbsp;the language we use (mad, spicy&nbsp;language mostly, innit), and what&nbsp;we use that language to talk about. Love, mostly.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417418949|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|291baddc488d96e3bb925933f74308f7bdf76f12 -->",

        "body":"<p>Should Britain follow France and Belgium in a general ban on wearing the full-face veil in public? Using threats and coercion to force a Muslim woman to adopt a full-face veil is already a criminal offence in the UK, and our schools, workplaces and courts already have wide powers to impose restrictions or bans if they deem it necessary – only yesterday a judge ruled that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/16/muslim-woman-niqab-judge-ruling\" title=\"\">defendant should remove her veil in the witness box</a>. So those who have detailed knowledge of the facts on the ground are already able to balance the freedom of Muslim women with other important interests such as the education of children, workplace efficiency and fair trial.</p><p>But should we go further? Should there be a general ban on adult British Muslim women who freely choose to wear the full-face veil? And if so, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/16/debate-muslim-veil-lib-dem-minister\" title=\"\">should senior politicians lead this public debate</a>, as some in Britain suggest? The French and Belgian experience suggests caution.</p><p>In Britain we need a debate within the Muslim communities. The Islamic tradition contains many routes rather than just one for women who want to preserve modesty or affirm their spirituality. Alternatives to full-face veils should be actively explored by responsible Muslim leadership with women's involvement, thereby shifting normative religious practices. Religious leaders could, for example, voluntarily introduce a ban on the full-face veil in Muslim schools to safeguard the interests of girls too young to give consent. A debate led by politicians will inhibit such a discussion.</p><p>Recent empirical evidence shows that very few French, Belgian and British women wear the full-face veil. Those who do have a range of reasons, and their decision changes with life experiences: sometimes the full-face veil goes on, but it frequently comes off again.</p><p>Crucially, the first-hand testimony of the women themselves confirms that they are not coerced, but freely adopt the full-face veil. They are often intelligent, autonomous and articulate. Yet French and Belgian politicians did nothing to listen to Muslim women before passing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/11/france-bans-burqa-and-niqab?INTCMP=SRCH&amp;guni=Article:in%20body%20link&amp;guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\">criminal laws</a> that restrict their freedom. The French commission (led by the communist politician, Andre Gérin) allowed just one Muslim woman to address them, but they also insisted she take off her full-face veil before doing so.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/22/belgium-burqa-ban\" title=\"\">Belgium, too, adopted a criminal ban</a> without any attempt to consult Muslim women, let alone invite them to participate in the creation of laws that would have such an impact on their personal freedom. French and Belgian Muslim women have bitterly complained that they experience this as a breach of their democratic rights and an example of double standards by politicians who urge them to be integrated as equal citizens. Rather than serving the goal of integration, the French and Belgian debates left these women feeling alienated, defiant and isolated from mainstream democracy.</p><p>In contemporary debates, the full-face veil is frequently presented as a medieval practice. And yet, in a supreme irony, the contemporary European response to the full-face veil can itself be seen as \"medieval\". Today's debates about, and treatment of, veiled Muslim women are akin to the way heretics, lepers and Jews were talked about and treated in medieval Europe when, according to the historian <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CEAQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.euroculture.upol.cz%2Fdokumenty%2Fsylaby%2FMedieval_Moore-Persecuting-society_(3).pdf&amp;ei=aD43Ur3vD4bF7Ab8h4G4Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6yCAHHRHXuC26XKSgdFX8S77qIA&amp;sig2=vp8NgZq2XPzGddIJ3b3xDg&amp;bvm=bv.52164340,d.ZGU&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">RI Moore, Europe became a \"persecuting society\"</a>.</p><p>In Moore's account, European identity was formed through the persecution of vulnerable groups, especially non-Christians such as Jews or heretics, who did not fit into emerging definitions of what it meant to be European. Even where no actual harm had been caused, or individual victim, and no anti-clerical sentiment overtly expressed, the governing authorities began to actively initiate prosecutions – thereby extending their reach deeper into the beliefs and private lives of \"heretic\" individuals and communities.</p><p>The response to the full-face veil in Belgium and France displays many of these features by extending a ban in specific spheres, such as schools, the workplace and courts, to all appearances in the public sphere, and by constructing certain Muslim religious practices as so \"radical\" as to be incompatible with full democratic citizenship and what it means to be a \"European\".</p><p>In medieval Europe, this legal shift towards persecution was supported by a false public rhetoric created by political elites rather than the populus. Moore shows that the production of false knowledge about the victims of persecution, such as heretics and Jews, as well as the destruction of their actual identities, was a crucial feature of Europe's \"persecuting societies\".</p><p>Again, there are parallels today. Post 9/11 and 7/7 discussions of Muslims in Europe have generated an anti-Islam ideology that has now been adopted by the far right throughout Europe. Political elites have exaggerated rather than alleviated understandable popular anxieties about Muslim religious difference in ways that often make reasonable debates impossible. French and Belgian politicians debating the full-face veil, for example, played a crucial role in legitimising far right ideologies and converting popular anxieties into criminal law. British political elites need to learn lessons here and take greater care in their discussion of Muslims.</p><p>In the case of Muslim women, gender equality has played a crucial role in the creation of a false identity that silences their voices, excludes them from democratic processes and leads to their persecution. On the one hand, Muslim men's treatment of \"their\" women is seen as a sign of their backwardness and barbarity. On the other, Muslim women are represented as a threat because of their refusal to take off their veils and adapt themselves to modernity. This paradoxical process represents Muslim women as victims of patriarchy who need to be rescued, but also – simultaneously – symbols of radical Islam who deserve to be criminalised \"for their own good\".</p><p>The full-face veil is a perfectly proper subject for discussion and legislation in a liberal democracy. The voices of Muslim women themselves, as well as non-Muslims who have understandable anxieties about the full-face veil, deserve to be heard. It is also right that the full-face veil should be regulated by local decision-makers like teachers or judges in certain situations, and Muslims must accept these reasonable limits on their freedom.</p><p>But it is crucial to distinguish such legitimate debate, and reasonable legal regulation, from political and legal responses such as those in France and Belgium that construct Muslim religious difference as barbaric – thereby targeting veiled Muslim women as the latest victims in Europe's long history of persecution.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417447057|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|1052f26781faa03379081483eb1ded07ebabe008 -->",

        "body":"<p>Whenever the pro-cannabis lobby starts agitating for legalisation, there is one crucial question that is always glossed over. They trot out the evidence proving that legalisation will hurt the drug cartels, help the terminally ill and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/15/legal-cannabis-market-worth\" title=\"\">even boost the economy</a>.</p><p>I understand the logic behind those arguments. I accept there are sick people who claim cannabis is the only analgesic in existence that will give them pain relief, despite there being literally hundreds of alternatives . I accept that if you taxed drugs you would&nbsp;generate billions for the economy. I even&nbsp;listen sympathetically to what the \"give-a-spliff-a-chance\" brigade say about not criminalising \"recreational\" users who are, apparently, perfectly normal, functioning citizens who should not be&nbsp;labelled criminals.</p><p>What I don't understand at all is what decriminalisation of drugs will do for addicts. I mean not only active addicts who are locked in compulsive drug use, but also those millions of potential addicts, most of them children, who have not yet picked up their first drug and could go either way.</p><p>Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/amanda-feilding\" title=\"\">Amanda Feilding</a>, Countess of Wemyss and March, can explain it to me. She heads the <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Beckley Foundation</a>, a thinktank that exists to change drugs policy and which will this week publish a 143-page costed analysis of what would happen if cannabis were licensed and regulated in England and Wales. To me, it jars more than a little that Feilding sits in an Oxfordshire country house called Beckley Park and tells the rest of us that she wants to unleash more cannabis on our streets.</p><p>I don't live in a stately home built during the reign of Henry VIII. I live in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balham\" title=\"\">Balham</a>, south-west London, and I remember very well how in July 2001 they started a 13-month decriminalisation trial in Lambeth. During that time, you couldn't walk to the station in the morning without getting high on the smoke being puffed out all over the place by every Nike-wearing hoodlum.</p><p>It didn't lure me astray – I'm done with my youthful experimenting – but it did occur to me that it was not all that helpful to parents trying to warn their kids not to try skunk when they could sample it just by breathing the air.</p><p>But let's give the countess a hearing. The <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/2013/09/cannabis-market-in-england-and-wales-cost-benefit-analysis/\" title=\"\">study</a> has been conducted by the Institute of Social and Economic research is advertised as \"a model of rigorous academic analysis\". It will set out three possible scenarios of what it thinks is most likely to happen following decriminalisation. The fact that they don't know any more precisely than saying \"well, it will be one of three things\", ought to cause enough alarm, but there we are. The scenarios apparently focus on the likely market shares for illegal and legal cannabis.</p><p>The report will call for cannabis to be taxed at 70%, the level of the mind-altering substance <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol\" title=\"\">tetrahydrocannabinol</a> (THC) limited to 10% and a substance that balances out the THC, called cannabidiol, increased somewhat. This, it says, would counter the explosion of super-strong skunk, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8386344.stm\" title=\"\">linked to psychosis</a>.</p><p>They estimate the revenue generated for the exchequer would be up to £1.25bn. Feilding says it is all about allowing the state to protect the young better than the drugs cartels will.</p><p>I am sure the countess is right that the move would bring in revenue. Before long the exchequer would be doing a booming trade in misery, although at £1.25bn that's still only one eightieth of the possible cost of HS2. I also note what she and others say about the street drugs being traded illegally being stronger and more harmful than those that could be sold \"safely\" over the counter. But I suspect young drug users won't want the cannabis they can get legally. If it's a case of buying something they are allowed or looking for something that is more illicit, they will still seek out a dealer to buy some of the super-strength stuff.</p><p>The countess is also fond of quoting statistics showing that cannabis kills far fewer people than tobacco. She claims 200,000 people around the world die from illegal drugs compared with five million from tobacco.</p><p>But if that is so, it is probably because so few do cannabis. And given that nice low figure of cannabis deaths, wouldn't it be better to keep the numbers down, rather than boost them up to levels commensurate with drink and cigarettes by making it more acceptable to do it?</p><p>The legalisation lobby is right to point&nbsp;out the inconsistency in some substances being banned and some not. It is a messy compromise, but it is the best compromise we have.</p><p>It is a misconception to say you have to either legalise everything or ban everything. What is needed, more than ever in our \"everything goes\" society, is a bit of restraint every now and again. If the only thing we ever achieve with drugs policy is to make sure our kids don't get the idea to try drugs after inhaling secondhand skunk while they are walking to school, we can at least look ourselves in the mirror.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417437510|2013-09-17T11:10:03Z|2f034d6a4a7d6286c774ebcc1fbbd1c0a5aa8f12 -->",

        "body":"<p>A \"flat Earth love-in\". That's how one MP described <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091045000001\" title=\"\">the debate&nbsp;he witnessed in parliament last week</a>. The politics with which citizens of the United States, Canada and Australia are now wearily familiar, in which elected representatives denounce both scientific evidence and the researchers who produce it, have arrived in Britain.</p><p>A couple of years ago I decided to stop arguing with climate change deniers. It was driving me mad. Spend too much time grappling with the convolutions of people like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nigel_Lawson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10&amp;editintro=Template:BLP_editintro\" title=\"\">Nigel Lawson</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Monckton,_3rd_Viscount_Monckton_of_Brenchley\" title=\"\">Christopher Monckton</a>, Mail and Telegraph columnists <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&amp;authornamef=David+Rose\" title=\"\">David Rose</a> and Christopher Booker, and some of it rubs off on you. I began to feel like the man in the celebrated cartoon: \"<a href=\"http://twitpic.com/zrbzl\" title=\"\">I can't come to bed yet, dear. Someone is wrong on the internet</a>.\"</p><p>But this, in Westminster, is something new: a group of parliamentarians, some of them, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Redwood\" title=\"\">John Redwood</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lilley\" title=\"\">Peter Lilley</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tyrie\" title=\"\">Andrew Tyrie</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Stringer\" title=\"\">Graham Stringer</a>, senior and experienced, prepared to abandon all caution and declare an all-out war on the evidence. Listening to <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2013-09-10a.235.1\" title=\"\">the debate on Tuesday</a>, I had the sense that they were undergoing an initiation test, like Mara gang members acquiring a facial tattoo. To show you are a true believer, you must disfigure your political record by reciting a ream of nonsense in parliament. So, with a heavy heart, I find myself going in again.</p><p>They appeared to have two aims: to torpedo the report being published next week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and to strike down the UK's <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/27/contents\" title=\"\">Climate Change Act</a>. Were it not for the fact that they now represent a powerful current of opinion within parliament, in which the environment secretary swims, I would bang my head three times against the wall then move on. But their power and reach, their clanking certainties and outrageous misrepresentations demand a response.</p><p>The debate was proposed by a Conservative MP named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Davies_(Welsh_politician)\" title=\"\">David TC Davies</a>, who used his speech to produce a long list of conspiracy theories and zombie myths: claims that have been repeatedly debunked but keep resurfacing. Here are a couple of examples, to give you a sense of the distance some of our elected representatives have established between themselves and the evidence.</p><p>\"It is not proven,\" Davies said, \"that the carbon dioxide that has gone into the atmosphere is responsible for the relatively small amount of warming that has taken place since industrialisation.\" Well, of course it's not proven – nothing is. But the evidence is impressive. Perhaps Davies is unaware of the <a href=\"http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=%22climate+change%22%2C+attribution&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_vis=1\" title=\"\">mountain of scientific work on the subject</a>, investigating the likely contribution of sunspots, volcanoes and other natural causes, and measuring changes in the amount of <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm\" title=\"\">radiation reflected back to the Earth's surface by greenhouse gases</a>. These <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spms2.html\" title=\"\">studies attribute most of the warming of the past few decades to us</a>.</p><p>Davies insisted that \"in the 1970s everyone was predicting a forthcoming ice age\". But a study of the peer-reviewed literature on climate change published between 1965 and 1979 found just <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1\" title=\"\">seven articles suggesting that the world might be cooling, and 44 proposing that it was likely to get warmer</a>. The \"emphasis on greenhouse warming\", it concludes, \"dominated the scientific literature even then\". There were several stories in the popular press suggesting an impending ice age but scientists cannot be blamed for that, any more than they can be blamed for Davies's claim that \"it is an ice age that we should be worried about\".</p><p>On he went, churning through familiar fables and wild conspiracies about the role of the Met Office, which \"did everything possible to withhold its evidence and calculations\" by, er, publishing them on its website. The bastards. But one statement stands out. Davies maintained that according to a parliamentary answer he'd received, \"every person in the country will be paying between £4,700 and £5,300 a year towards the government's climate change policies\". I looked up the answer. It says nothing of the kind.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130902/text/130902w0011.htm\" title=\"\">figures he was given are the average per person for all energy costs between 2010 and 2050</a>: \"all capital, operating and fuel costs for the whole energy system including cars, trains, planes, power stations, boilers and insulation\". Climate change policies account for a very small part of the total. The answer was provided just eight days before the debate. It is hard to understand how Davies could have remembered the figures but forgotten what they represented.</p><p>He's not the only one who mangled the evidence like this. The Labour MP Graham Stringer joined the witch-hunt by claiming that the Met Office's research department – the Hadley Centre, based in Exeter – had been discredited by an inquiry led by Lord (Ronald) Oxburgh. But Oxburgh's inquiry investigated (and largely exonerated) a completely different body at the other end of the country: the <a href=\"http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/crustatements/sap\" title=\"\">University of East Anglia's climatic research unit</a>. What makes this really odd is that Stringer, as a member of the Commons science and technology committee, conducted a parallel inquiry into the unit, during which he was noted for his <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/387/387i.pdf\" title=\"\">aggressive questioning</a>. How could he have forgotten which body was the subject of these investigations?</p><p>Even if we are to believe that these elected representatives have such poor memories or such feeble powers of comprehension, Davies and Stringer both owe the House of Commons a correction.</p><p>It was cheering to see a Conservative minister, <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2294544/greg-barker-calls-for-new-conservative-green-narrative\" title=\"\">Greg Barker</a>, mount a robust defence of the science, especially as one of his colleagues, the environment secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/sep/07/owen-paterson-climate-change-sceptic\" title=\"\">Owen Paterson, has now publicly rejected it</a>, siding with the fossil fuel lobbyists <a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/paterson-on-climate.html\" title=\"\">against the evidence</a>. But for how much longer will the government hold the line against the flat-Earthers in its own ranks? Will we soon find ourselves in the position of Australia, with a prime minister who once described manmade global warming as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/07/australia-election-tony-abbott-liberal-victory\" title=\"\">absolute crap</a>\"?</p><p>Never underestimate the willingness of powerful people to ignore the evidence they find inconvenient. Never&nbsp;underestimate their willingness to appease industrial lobbyists by repeating the nonsense they generate. Never underestimate their readiness to sacrifice the common interests of humankind for the sake of a belief they refuse to abandon.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a><em>.
