        "body":"<p>The former boss of Northern Rock, Adam Applegarth, has left the private equity firm he joined four years ago with the hope of rehabilitating himself following the banking crisis.</p><p>Applegarth had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/01/disgraced-northern-rock-boss-job\" title=\"\">joined Apollo Global Management in the autumn of 2009</a>, two years after the run on the Newcastle-based lender that eventually led to the bank's nationalisation. He had presided over the first run on a bank since 1866 and later described 9 August 2007 as the \"day the world changed\", marking the start of the credit crunch which froze the bank out of the wholesale markets on which it relied for financing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/banking/article3896776.ece\" title=\"\">According to the Times</a>, he has now resigned as an advisor to Apollo after causing controversy by becoming involved in bids for parts of Northern Rock and the 314 branches which Royal Bank of Scotland needed to sell, and are now being sold to a consortium involving the Church of England.</p><p>Officials from Apollo were not available for comment but the resignation of Applegarth comes as the roles of former bankers during the crisis have been subjected to fresh scrutiny following the report into the collapse of HBOS. James Crosby, the former boss of HBOS, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/11/hbos-james-crosby-formally-stripped-knighthood\" title=\"\">gave back his knighthood after criticism by the parliamentary commission on banking standards</a>.</p><p>Applegarth quit Northern Rock in December 2007 – two months before Alistair Darling stepped in to nationalise the former building society – with a payoff of around £760,000, ending a 20-year  areer with the bank which he had joined as graduate trainee.</p><p>The government later split Northern Rock into two: a \"good\" bank which has been bought by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Money and a \"bad\" bank which is still owned taxpayers and part of UK Asset Resolution which is running down the remaining loans.</p><p>It is not clear how much Applegarth has been paid over the past four years by Apollo which specialises in buying distressed loans and securities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420241190|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|cbf51c2932067be3705493c4ae1ea52492f975af -->",

        "body":"<p>British Gas will raise energy prices by an average of 9.2% next month, piling further financial pressure on 7.8 million households and reigniting the political row over soaring gas and electricity prices.</p><p>Parent company Centrica became the second of the Big Six energy firms to announce a price rise after SSE hiked prices last week. The average annual dual fuel bill with British Gas will increase by £107 to £1,297.</p><p>Centrica blamed the above-inflation hike on higher costs for wholesale energy and delivering gas and electricity to homes, and government's \"social and environmental programmes\" which are paid for through customers' bills.</p><p>Electricity bills will rise by 10.4% and gas bills by 8.4% from 23 November. With usage and regional variations this equates to an average price rise of 9.2%, Centrica said.</p><p>The move escalated the row between energy providers and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who accused SSE of \"ripping off\" customers after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/10/sse-raises-prices-average-annual-bill\" title=\"\">announced an 8.2% price hike for its 7 million customers</a>.</p><p>Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy and climate change secretary, said the latest rise by British Gas showed \"clearer than ever\" why Miliband's proposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/sep/25/centrica-sse-labour-miliband-price-freeze\" title=\"\">20-month energy price freeze</a> was needed.</p><p>British Gas said on Thursday that although it recognised energy bills were a \"real worry for hard-pressed households\", the decision was down to rising costs \"that are not all directly under our control\".</p><p>Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas residential energy, said: \"I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes aren't keeping pace. We haven't taken this decision lightly.\"</p><p>He said the best way to keep bills down was by increased energy efficiency, and urged customers to check whether or not they were eligible for measures such as insulation.</p><p>Tom Lyon, an energy expert at uSwitch.com, said the price rise would leave customers feeling \"betrayed\": \"Today's price hike will be seen by many as a broken promise after the supplier suggested in May that it would use the extra profits it made last winter to hold off from any price hikes.</p><p>\"British Gas customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed.\"</p><p>The company, however, insisted it was making \"fair profits\" for \"keeping homes warm and keeping the lights on\".</p><p>It said it was offering a new tariff which guarantees that prices will not go up until 30 November 2014. If standard prices fall, the fixed tariff will fall too, it said.</p><p>Clare Francis, editor-in-chief at Moneysupermarket.com, said other energy providers were likely to follow the move.</p><p>\"It won't stop there. We can expect the other four major providers – EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – to also announce price hikes over the coming weeks.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420240604|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|493b82738e2b048aed1dc17dad936811b19e19dc -->",

After a short time-lag, the government's Help to Buy deposit insurance scheme and the Bank of England's funding for lending initiative, which has depressed mortgage rates, appear to have pushed up the number of transactions and the demand for homeware.</p><p>The ONS said a look back over the previous three months revealed a period of growth, with retail sales up 1.5% quarter on quarter.</p><p>\"This is the largest quarter-on-quarter rise since March 2008 when the economy as a whole was at its peak, before the economic downturn,\" it said.</p><p>Alan Clarke, UK economist at Scotia Bank, described the figures as solid and unspectacular.</p><p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, said: \"Retail sales showed a welcome revival in September after dipping in August, adding further to mounting evidence that the economy grew strongly in the third quarter. The three months to September have been the best quarter the retail sector has seen the start of 2008, suggesting an encouraging lead-up to the all-important Christmas season.</p><p>He said: \"The upturn corroborates data from Visa, which showed a wider measure of total consumer spending up a buoyant 1.5% during September.\"</p><p>Consumer confidence, which has risen sharply in recent months largely because people have been busier at work, has driven incomes higher and provided greater job security, he said.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/oct/16/employment-growing-wage-slaves-ons-prices-pay\" title=\"\">Employment jumped higher in August</a>, pushing the number of jobless benefits claimants down at the fastest rate since 1997. Rising house prices have added to he feel-good factor,\" he added.</p><p>Clarke said that based on surveys of manufacturing, construction and services industries, GDP should grow by 1.2% quarter on quarter.</p><p>The first estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter is published on 25 October and economists' estimates vary from 0.7% to 1.2%.</p><p>\"It's just that lacklustre industrial production data, the soggy July monthly services reading and mediocre retail sales have undermined faith in a super-strong outcome,\" Clarke said.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/16/bank-of-england-interest-rates-may-rise-next-year\" title=\"\">an interview with the Guardian</a> on Wednesday, Spencer Dale, the Bank of England's chief economist, pointed to a strong GDP number when he said the economy was \"growing at something like 3-4% annualised\".</p><p>Dale said it was possible Threadneedle Street would raise interest rates as early as next year if the strength of the recovery was maintained.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420237666|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|992e6667b2881e56d2a92415da9fa31e4d38902c -->",

        "body":"<p>HMV is relaunching its online strategy seven months after it was bought out of administration. The entertainment retailer, which is now owned by restructuring specialist Hilco, has kickstarted its new digital strategy with a free mobile phone app, which launched on Thursday.</p><p>The app allows shoppers to buy or listen to tasters of tracks by scanning CD covers, posters or adverts in store or elsewhere or by playing songs from the radio into their phone. It will be the first non-iTunes based digital music download app available via Apple phones.</p><p>Users can buy or pre-order tracks from HMV's digital catalogue and store them in an online locker to play on Android or Apple phones.</p><p>The retailer's digital music store will be fully integrated into a revamped website, which is due to launch next week, extending the ability to listen to and buy digital music to other platforms, including Mac OS X, Windows PC as well as BlackBerry 10 and Windows smartphones.</p><p>Paul McGowan, the chief executive of Hilco Capital and chairman of HMV, said: \"HMV's position at the heart of entertainment retail demands that we enable customers to buy their music from HMV in the way that best suits them and to engage more closely with the music, video and gaming worlds.\"</p><p>Hilco's £50m buyout of HMV secured 2,500 jobs at 141 shops, just over half the chain. The buyout was strongly supported by music labels keen to back an alternative to online behemoth Amazon. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/15/hmv-in-administration-key-facts\" title=\"\">HMV fell into administration in January</a> amid tough competition from supermarkets and online stores such as Amazon. It also struggled to cope as shoppers switched rapidly to digital downloads of music, films and computer games and increasingly used online services such as Spotify and Netflix, rather than browsing for CDs and DVDs on the high street.</p><p>HMV's new app and online store is part of a fightback strategy as nearly 30% of music sold in the UK was downloaded last year compared with about 20% in 2010, according to figures from retail analysts Conlumino. By 2015, about 45% of music is expected to be downloaded.</p><p>Alongside the new app and website, McGowan said HMV would also be revitalising its YouTube channel and stepping up the number of live events in its stores.</p><p>Hilco is hoping to repeat the success it has had so far with HMV Canada, which it bought several years ago.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420224541|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|5e924021c890cf19ec81638b1b7aa08431739e05 -->",

        "body":"<p>A former chairman of the Australian Coal Association, who has accused the fossil fuel industry of &ldquo;stuffing up&rdquo; effective action on climate change, is fighting an insurgent battle to gain a seat on the board of the mining giant BHP Billiton.</p> <p>Ian Dunlop, formerly a senior executive in the oil, gas and coal industries, is attempting to gain shareholder support for his bid to challenge what he claims is &ldquo;utter bullshit&rdquo; from a resources industry that has stymied an urgent transition away from carbon-intensive fuels.</p> <p>The board of BHP, which will hold an annual general meeting in London next week and another in Perth on 21 November, has called on shareholders to reject Dunlop, with the chairman, Jacques Nasser, describing him as a single-issue candidate who would add little to the board.</p> <p>But Dunlop, who will fly to London for the meeting, told Guardian Australia that shareholders were &ldquo;curious&rdquo; about his bid and that BHP required a strong advocate for dealing with the challenge of climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;This is an unusual situation, which has created a lot of interest among shareholders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There needs to be a range of perspectives on boards or you get locked into the kind of groupthink that the fossil fuel industry has on climate change.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop has turned to climate change activism after his career in the fossil fuel industry, chairing <a href=\"http://www.safeclimateaustralia.org\">Safe Climate Australia</a> and become a member of the <a href=\"http://www.clubofrome.org\">Club of Rome</a>, which has warned of the limits of sustainable living.</p> <p>He told Guardian Australia that the resources industry had &ldquo;completely ignored the catastrophic risk&rdquo; posed to their business models by climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;The industry hasn&rsquo;t shown any leadership as it hadn&rsquo;t been prepared to admit what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we want to keep below the limit of 2C warming, which is already far too high, we cannot continue ad infinitum in Australia talking about doubling our coal exports and tripling our gas exports.</p> <p>&ldquo;BHP, to be fair to them, is doing more than most but when I look around the boardrooms of Australia, the UK or US I see absolutely no recognition of the strategic implications of climate change.</p> <p>&ldquo;These businesses have got a horrendous problem when it comes to [climate] risk management. Waiting until it is too late and then being forced to do something in a panic isn&rsquo;t risk management in my book.</p> <p>&ldquo;There is a mind block towards it. Some [executives] are in denial while others have this gently, gently approach, whereas the reality is far more urgent. You simply can&rsquo;t do business in a world with 4C of warming. Shareholder value will go down the tubes.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop said governments had abrogated their responsibility to lead on climate change, while the resources industry had failed to take the initiative owing to its focus on short-term profit.</p> <p>&ldquo;The industry used to have nation builders but now it has technocrats with a short-term focus,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Their arguments are utter bullshit. Utter nonsense. We have a global problem and if we all sit on our hands we&rsquo;ll all commit suicide together.</p> <p>&ldquo;[Environment minister] Greg Hunt&rsquo;s approach won&rsquo;t do anything, so we need business leaders capable of articulating the problem. The likes of Rio Tinto and the Minerals Council express great concern about climate change but then allow [others] to whiteant any action.</p> <p>&ldquo;[The industry has been] actively stuffing up carbon pricing for the past decade. That&rsquo;s just not acceptable anymore.&rdquo;</p> <p>Dunlop admitted that it was &ldquo;unusual&rdquo; for shareholders to ignore a board&rsquo;s advice on director appointments but said he was hopeful of winning them around.</p> <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be on the board to destroy the joint,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;BHP is a diversified miner and has got a solid, long future, but it has got to get out of fossil fuels.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420220890|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|700c7937b2e0c6ede81cccbaa5f97454ac1abcf5 -->",

Now, at the 11th hour, a deal has finally been thrashed out and, barring any last minute hiccups, will be approved by Congress.</p> <p>But the US government has been paralysed during a 16-day shutdown that is so far estimated to have cost US$24bn - US$1.5bn a day.</p> <p>The US government will soon reopen and America may have avoided a catastrophic default, but has the problem simply been kicked down the road? And what will be the lasting impact not only on the US, but on Australia and the rest of the global economy?</p> <p>Greg Jericho writes the Grogonomics blog for Guardian Australia. While working as a public servant he wrote the blog Grog’s Gamut which came to prominence during the 2010 federal election.</p> <p>He left the public service in 2011 to write the book, “The Rise of the Fifth Estate” on social media and blogging in Australian politics.

Defence spending is going to play a big role in the next round. The deal done today really just kicks the can down the road till Jan 15 re the Govt shutdown and mid February for the debt ceiling. Not coincidentally Jan 15 is when the next round of sequestration cut kick in, and they are suggested to have a much larger impact than the ones which were somewhat watered down this year.</p> <p>&nbsp;The big issue is defence spending. One report has suggested that if the sequester cuts continue then by 2021, &quot;ground divisions will drop from 20 to six, Air Force fighter and attack planes will drop by 1,632 aircraft, and Navy ships will drop by 338, with the aircraft carrier force declining from 15 carriers to seven in 2021.&quot;</p> <p>Normally Republicans would be getting quite antsy about this, but the political situation regarding the Tea Party and govt spending cuts is such that they have recently toned down their rhetoric on this because they the Tea Party want across the board spending cuts to come in</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009477\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914963\" title=\"View OGriffey’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/08/21/11914963/2b1c14aa-d8d7-4916-9e4d-64a0eafae6cb/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for OGriffey\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914963\" title=\"View OGriffey’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">OGriffey</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28009477\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 2:01am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Should the US debt ceiling be abolished and does Australia have anything similar as Joe Hockey seemed to imply while in opposition?</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yep it should be abolished.

The market doesn't give a stuff about it being raised - the bond yields never go up because it is raised, they only go up when Congress threatens to block move for it to be raised.</p> <p>But I can't see it happening, purely because there are those who view it as a weapon in their arsenal that they can use to force spending cuts etc. But what today has really shown is that if the other side refuses to budge the threat to allow a default up being empty.</p> <p>So logically there is no reason to keep it even politically, but again I think logic isn't much in play. It;s worth noting that Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul still voted against the Bill that just went through the Senate. Now maybe they did so only because they knew it would pass, but it does show that the belief that there is political benefit from forcing a default still remains.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010163\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416941\" title=\"View Katealan’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Katealan\" /> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/12416941\" title=\"View Katealan’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Katealan</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010163\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 3:10am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Would it be possible for the US to buy its own debt and then not demand repayment, as suggested by Terry McCrann today? </p> <p>Why would/wouldn't this work?</p></div> </div> </div> </figure> <p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have seen that view expressed - for eg an article on <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/10/09/ending-the-debt-limit-crisis-dear-ben-bernanke/\">Reuters' website </a>suggested:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>&quot;So a simple solution to the impasse is as follows: Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke should simply cancel the Treasury debt that it owns. The government can just forgive the government’s debt.</p> <p>&quot;This wouldn’t solve the debt problem entirely. The Federal Reserve doesn’t own all U.S. government debt; it owns only roughly $2 trillion of it. (Well $2,076,927,000,000.00, as of last Wednesday, but who’s counting?)&quot;</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What this is is essentially short-term solution to get the govt through any period where they would actually default. Similarly the Treasury could have sold some of its gold to raise some cash. This would stop the US from actually defaulting - ie not being able to pay back money it owes. But for how long could they do this is the issue and the big worry would be how the market would react.</p> <p>It's a bit like you telling your bank when you go to get a housing loan that you will be able to make the mortgage repayments because you can sell your car if things get tight. It doesn't scream confidence, and the system is essentially built on the fact that US will never ever ever default.</p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010445\"> <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914573\" title=\"View Greg Jericho’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2013/05/27/11914573/802e1f94-9505-473c-8d7d-3053588ef311/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Greg Jericho\" /> </a> <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/11914573\" title=\"View Greg Jericho’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Greg Jericho</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/28010445\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">17 October 2013 3:41am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Well that will do us for today. </p> <p>Thanks all for your great questions. </p> <p>It looks like America has avoided financial and economic catastrophe for itself and the rest of us at least until February when the debt ceiling deadline occurs once again - because obviously doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is a smart way to govern a country.</p> <p>No doubt Americans will enjoy Christmas this year knowing that this could all start (or more to the point, stop) again on January 15!</p> <p>Thanks again, </p> <p>Greg</p></div> </div> </div> </figure><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420198102|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|e81429ff86873fa75ddce49102371c38a87d684f -->",

        "body":"<p>The government shutdown has so far cost the US economy $24bn &ndash; or $1.5bn a day, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s said on Wednesday.</p> <p>The argument over the government shutdown, now in its 16th day, and over raising the US&rsquo;s debt ceiling, appeared to have come to a short-term resolution Wednesday as Congress rolled out a plan to fund federal agencies and extend America's borrowing authority into early next year.</p> <p>The news of the deal boosted stock markets. S&amp;P warned, however, that the political impasse had shaved at least 0.6% off US GDP on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2013. The cut is equivalent to taking $24bn out of the economy.</p> <p>S&amp;P triggered selloffs on stock markets around the world in 2011 when it downgraded US debt during the previous row over raising the debt ceiling. This week rival Fitch warned that it, too, had turned negative on US credit and was considering a downgrade.</p> <p>S&amp;P said it expected the Congress would pass the Senate resolution to fund the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the current chatter coming out of Washington suggests that any continuing resolution will be a temporary one, with an early 2014 timeframe for the next set of Washington deadlines. The short turnaround for politicians to negotiate some sort of lasting deal will likely weigh on consumer confidence, especially among government workers that were furloughed,&rdquo; the agency said.</p> <p>&ldquo;If people are afraid that the government policy brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to another humbug holiday season,&rdquo; the agency said. &ldquo;The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the US economy.&rdquo;</p> <p>US markets rebounded on news of a deal in Washington. The Dow closed up 205 points (1.36%), the S&amp;P 500 rose 23.45 points (1.38%) and the Nasdaq 45.42 points (1.2%). Markets had fallen Tuesday when it appeared that a deal was out of reach.</p> <p>In a note to investors Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist at Capital Economics, wrote: &ldquo;Financial markets have been buoyed by media reports indicating that both the Senate and the House are preparing to vote imminently on a bill to reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>\"Once the initial euphoria has worn off, however, we suspect that investors will begin to focus on the short-term nature of the deal, which means that another shutdown is possible early in the New Year.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191944|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|4820ab9840b93c06c69f50a2e9ae261b432ef1b5 -->",

        "headline":"Interest rates may rise next year, says Bank of England chief economist",
        "body":"<p>The Bank of England warned that interest rates might rise as early as next year as its chief economist said Threadneedle Street's desire to keep borrowing costs low for several years could be thwarted by a combination of stronger than expected growth and unusually weak productivity.</p><p>Spencer Dale, one of the nine members of the rate-setting monetary policy committee, said the UK was currently growing at an annual rate of 3-4% and the Bank could not be certain when it might need to tighten policy.</p><p>Following guidance issued by the Bank in August, the City is expecting interest rates to remain on hold at their record low of 0.5% until at least 2015. But Dale said in a Guardian interview that in certain circumstances an increase could happen as soon as 2014.</p><p>\"What we are clear about is what the state of the economy will be like when we raise interest rates. What we are not as clear about is whether that is two years ahead, three years ahead, or one year ahead. But it is clear that we are thinking of years not months,\" Dale said.</p><p>The Bank said in August that unless there was a risk from inflation or an over-heating property market it would only start thinking about raising interest when unemployment had come down to 7% from 7.7% currently, something it did not expect until 2016. But the recovery in the economy seen since the spring has left many in the City convinced that the Bank will be forced to take action before then.</p><p>Dale said that \"forward guidance\" had been useful in explaining how the Bank was likely to behave, and that he was \"nervous that some people may be thinking we are going to raise rates just because we are going to have strong growth\".</p><p>\"By doing that [forward guidance], we reduce the likelihood that people, when they see a few quarters of strong growth, expect us to raise rates. We have reduced the likelihood of a premature raising of rates.\"</p><p>But Dale said he could not say for sure how long the period of 0.5% interest rates would last. \"The economy looks as if it is growing at something like 3-4% annualised. Bank rate is at 0.5%, something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. The big message is that monetary policy is going to remain loose for a considerable period of time. I can't be sure whether that means it will be tightened in 2015 or 2016. It could be 2015. It could be a bit earlier than that or a bit later.\"</p><p>Asked whether the Bank could raise rates as early as next year, Dale replied: \"Conceivably it could be 2014. But it would have to be in a world where you had quite strong growth, perhaps stronger than you have got now, and a recovery in productivity weaker than I would expect.\"</p><p>Dale said the biggest downside risk to the economy was a renewed crisis in the euro area. \"We have seen some of the near term tensions ease, but the fundamental challenges are immense.\"</p><p>But he added that there was also a chance that the economy would grow far more strongly than currently expected.</p><p>\"If you take business surveys at face value and base your view of the economy purely on them it would suggest that the economy is growing in at a rate in excess of 4%. We might be misjudging it. It could be that the economy is coming back more quickly than we think.</p><p>\"I am aiming off of that slightly. I am aware of the fundamental challenges facing our economy. In particular, real incomes remain weak and we are not going to see a strong pick up in consumption until we see that.\"</p><p>Dale said that the economy was still 3% smaller than at its peak before the deep recession of 2008-09 and that the Bank was alive to the risk that a premature increase in borrowing costs could choke off recovery. He added that if markets failed to get the message and pushed up long-term interest rates to a level that impinged on the recovery, the Bank's monetary policy committee would act. \"The natural thing would be to do more quantitative easing and loosen policy to stimulate the economy.\"</p><p>Dale said he welcomed the fact that the housing market was recovering, and saw no immediate threat of a bubble. It was \"great\" for the construction sector that more houses were being built, and the increase in mortgage approvals boosted demand for professional services and led to greater labour mobility. \"It is good for consumption, because there is quite strong evidence that when people move home they go out and change the carpets and buy new furniture. We are moving from a housing market in deep freeze to where it is thawing and helping the recovery.\"</p><p>Dale said that one difference from previous cycles was that there was now a financial policy committee at the Bank of England armed with the tools to tackle any problems from the housing market.</p><p>He said \"bitter experience\" had shown what could happen when the housing market was allowed to overheat. \"I don't think that's where we are now but are very active to that risk. The Bank as a whole is. The monetary policy committee is. Most importantly, the financial policy committee is.\"</p><p>Asked if the Bank was being complacent, he replied: \"We are not being complacent. We are looking at this very closely.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420190744|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|12a5fb384dcdcd867ee2ca742719389d0385d411 -->",

S&amp;P warned, however, that the political impasse had shaved at least 0.6% off US GDP on an annualized basis for the fourth quarter of 2013. The cut is equivalent to taking $24bn out of the economy.</p> <p>S&amp;P triggered selloffs on stock markets around the world in 2011 when it downgraded US debt during the previous row over raising the debt ceiling. This week rival Fitch warned that it, too, had turned negative on US credit and was considering a downgrade.</p> <p>S&amp;P said it expected the Congress would pass the Senate resolution to fund the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>&ldquo;However, the current chatter coming out of Washington suggests that any continuing resolution will be a temporary one, with an early 2014 timeframe for the next set of Washington deadlines. The short turnaround for politicians to negotiate some sort of lasting deal will likely weigh on consumer confidence, especially among government workers that were furloughed,&rdquo; the agency said.</p> <p>&ldquo;If people are afraid that the government policy brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to another humbug holiday season,&rdquo; the agency said. &ldquo;The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the US economy.&rdquo;</p> <p>US markets rebounded on news of a deal in Washington. The Dow closed up 205 points (1.36%), the S&amp;P 500 rose 23.45 points (1.38%) and the Nasdaq 45.42 points (1.2%). Markets had fallen Tuesday when it appeared that a deal was out of reach.</p> <p>In a note to investors Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist at Capital Economics, wrote: &ldquo;Financial markets have been buoyed by media reports indicating that both the Senate and the House are preparing to vote imminently on a bill to reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling.</p> <p>\"Once the initial euphoria has worn off, however, we suspect that investors will begin to focus on the short-term nature of the deal, which means that another shutdown is possible early in the New Year.&rdquo;</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191944|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|4820ab9840b93c06c69f50a2e9ae261b432ef1b5 -->",

This represented a quarter-on-quarter increase of 6.13%, down from 6.9% the previous quarter and an average of over 10% in the previous six quarters.</p><p>Revenue for the nine months to September grew to $422m (£264m), up from $205m the year before. But increased marketing costs meant net losses widened from $71m to $134m.</p><p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/29/nasdaq-10m-fine-facebook-ipo\" title=\"\">bungling Facebook's high-profile float last year</a>, Nasdaq was unable to persuade Twitter to join Google and Apple on its roster of quoted stocks.</p><p>An 11th-hour intervention by the Nasdaq chief executive, Robert Greifeld, who according to Reuters flew to Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on 4 October to make a pitch in person, was ultimately unsuccessful.</p><p>In a statement, Nasdaq said it \"wished Twitter well\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/24/facebook-ipo-mark-zuckerberg-nasdaq\" title=\"\">Computer glitches delayed the start of trading in Facebook shares in May last year</a>, and left many investors with orders processed wrongly or not at all.</p><p>In August, confidence in the robustness of Nasdaq's IT systems was shaken further when it was forced to suspend trading for three hours.</p><p>With its pre-IPO investor roadshow expected to begin on 28 October, Twitter has decided to join professional networking site LinkedIn and internet radio Pandora Media on the NYSE.</p><p>\"This is a decisive win for the NYSE. We are grateful for Twitter's confidence in our platform and look forward to partnering with them,\" said Scott Cutler, head of the exchange's listings business.</p><p>The latest filing shows Twitter's US monthly users accelerated in September, reaching nearly 53 million compared with 49 million in June and 48 million in March.</p><p>Advertising revenues increased 123% during the quarter, said analyst Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research Group, which outstripped his 98% growth forecast. \"This represents a very solid pace of growth,\" he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420112269|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|a8f1814bd0c9678944ac755847b70e5d98a5e715 -->",

        "body":"<p>A former Halliburton manager pleaded guilty Tuesday to destroying evidence in the aftermath of the deadly rig explosion that spawned BP's massive 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Anthony Badalamenti, 62, of Katy, Texas, faces a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a $100,000 fine after his guilty plea in US district court to one misdemeanor count of destruction of evidence. His sentencing by US district judge Jay Zainey is set for 21 January.</p> <p>Badalamenti was the cementing technology director for Halliburton Energy Services Group, BP's cement contractor on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Prosecutors said he instructed two Halliburton employees to delete data during a post-spill review of the cement job on BP's blown-out Macondo well.</p> <p>Last month, a federal judge accepted a separate plea agreement calling for Halliburton to pay a $200,000 fine for a misdemeanor stemming from Badalamenti's conduct. Halliburton also agreed to be on probation for three years and to make a $55m contribution to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, but that payment was not a condition of the deal.</p> <p>The 20 April 2010 rig explosion killed 11 workers and led to the nation's worst offshore oil spill.</p> <p>In May 2010, according to prosecutors, Badalamenti directed a senior program manager to run computer simulations on centralizers, which are used to keep the casing centered in the wellbore. The results indicated there was little difference between using six or 21 centralizers. The data could have supported BP's decision to use the lower number.</p> <p>Badalamenti is accused of instructing the program manager to delete the results. The program manager \"felt uncomfortable\" about the instruction but complied, according to prosecutors.</p> <p>A different Halliburton employee also deleted data from a separate round of simulations at the direction of Badalamenti, who was acting without company authorization, prosecutors said.</p> <p>Halliburton notified investigators from a Justice Department task force about the deletion of data. Efforts to recover the data weren't successful.</p> <p>Badalamenti wasn't the first individual charged with a crime stemming from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but he is the first to plead guilty.</p> <p>BP well site leaders Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine await a trial next year on manslaughter charges stemming from the rig workers' deaths. They botched a key safety test and disregarded abnormally high pressure readings that were glaring signs of trouble before the well blowout, prosecutors say.</p> <p>Former BP executive David Rainey is charged with concealing information from Congress about the amount of oil that was spewing from the blown-out well in 2010. Former BP engineer Kurt Mix is charged with deleting text messages and voicemails about the company's response to the spill.</p> <p>Two floors down from the courtroom where Badalamenti pleaded guilty, US district judge Carl Barbier is presiding over a trial for spill-related civil litigation. For the trial's second phase, Barbier is hearing dueling estimates from experts for BP and the federal government about the amount of oil that spewed into the Gulf.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420045613|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|a28c100b3a6a85f9e82461f86bb09f178343838f -->",

        "headline":"Angela Ahrendts leaves Burberry for new job at Apple",
        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>Angela Ahrendts, the chief executive who led British brand Burberry's transformation into a sexy modern fashion  label, is swapping trenchcoats for a rather different range of macs.</p><p>Ahrendts, who was the highest-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100 last year with a pay package of almost £17m, has been poached by Apple, the world's most valuable company. She is expected to double her income when she becomes the boss of the iPad maker's global retail division next summer.</p><p>Half a billion pounds was wiped off Burberry's stockmarket value as her departure, and the appointment of Burberry's designer Christopher Bailey as her replacement, was announced.</p><p>Yorkshire-born Bailey and Ahrendts, a US fashion executive from Indiana, have worked closely together since her arrival in 2006, with the designer contributing ideas to many aspects of the business. The Royal College of Art graduate is credited with the social media strategy under which Burberry became the first big fashion house to stream catwalk shows live on the internet, but it is almost unknown for a design specialist to lead a company of Burberry's size.</p><p>Ahrendts is moving to a demanding job as Apple's status as the world's most profitable computer and smartphone maker is under pressure from rivals such as Samsung. But earlier this week Apple was named the world's most valuable brand, toppling Coca-Cola, and the stores she will oversee have higher sales per square foot than any other retailer in the world.</p><p>The last person to run Apple's retail empire was also hired from the UK. Former Dixons boss John Browett, was lured to the group's head office in Cupertino, California and handed a \"golden hello\" reported to be worth $56m (£35m). However, Browett never collected the full cash pile as he was fired after less than six months in the role in October last year.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420105261'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381857371581/Burberry-share-price-001.jpg' alt='Burberry share price' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Burberry’s share price before and after Angela Ahrendts resigned. Photograph: theguardian.com</figcaption></figure><p>Ahrendts will be well cushioned from any such risk in her new job by a stockpile of cash and shares gathered at Burberry. She currently owns shares worth £6.2m and will receive another tranche worth £7.34m  next month. Meanwhile, Ahrendts is working beyond her six-month notice period, which would end in April, enabling her to collect a bonus worth up to double her £1.1m salary as well as shares worth £6m due to be handed over in June. Including her basic pay that will take her total pay-out over the next six months to nearly £16m.</p><p>Ahrendts said: \"I'm proud of everything we've built, and the management team we have in place around the world and infrastructure we have put in place will provide a rock solid foundation for all [Bailey's] innovation.\"</p><p>Bailey said: \"We've done a lot of dreaming and made those dreams into solid strategies and built an incredible operational and management team to be able to meet those strategies.\"</p><p>Burberry shares slumped nearly 8% as investors worried that Bailey would struggle to run a £7bn company as well as heading the design operation. There were suggestions that Bailey had been handed the top job to stop him following Ahrendts out of the door.</p><p>Burberry insisted Bailey's appointment was the result of a long-term succession plan, but analysts and investors were sceptical. Rahul Sharma, a luxury goods analyst at Neev Capital said Burberry had little choice but to choose Bailey as Ahrendts most likely successor after former finance director Stacey Cartwright left earlier this year. \"I think Angela's move was a surprise to them. I would question whether they had any plan in place,\" she said.</p><p>While Ahrendts said Bailey, the Royal College of Art graduate who has been Burberry's creative visionary for 12 years, would be backed by \"the industry's most powerful management team,\" all the leading players are new. Finance director Carol Fairweather only stepped into the role in July this year while chief operating officer John Smith joined in March. While the company reported strong sales figures on Tuesday, it is still struggling to absorb the fragrance and beauty business it brought in house this spring and next year must tackle the handover of its key Japanese business from a long-term franchise partner.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive of Apple, said he was thrilled that Ahrendts would be joining his team. \"She has shown herself to be an extraordinary leader throughout her career and has a proven track record,\" he said.</p><p>Cook is banking on Ahrendts' experience building a global network of stores to build Apple's position as a global luxury brand, particularly in China where Burberry has grown rapidly while the tech company has struggled. Apple's store portfolio remains relatively small and in some areas is straining to cope with the demands of millions of new iPad and iPhone owners.Cook is clearly keen to build Apple's style credentials. Ahrendts joins Paul Deneve, the former chief executive officer of Yves St Laurent, who was recently hired by the iPhone maker to work on special projects.</p><p>The departure of Ahrendts will deplete the already-slim ranks of female chief executives at the UK's biggest companies. Her return to the US means there will be just two women running FTSE 100 businesses – Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of Easyjet.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419980276|2013-10-17T10:28:08Z|ecb14e4b98b5389cd448b5b664a06a6a8b6d1559 -->",
