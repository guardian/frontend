There are various ways that the US could play for time -- such as prioritising some payments over others, or&nbsp;delaying payments altogether.</p> <p>But officials would soon be forced to implement measures that would hurt growth badly, in a bid to avoid missing a&nbsp;debt repayment and triggering a downgrade to<strong> Selective Default</strong> status.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here's a flavour of the note:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the debt limit is not raised before the Treasury depletes its cash&nbsp;balance, it could force the Treasury to rapidly eliminate the budget&nbsp;deficit to stay under the debt ceiling. We estimate that the fiscal&nbsp;pullback would amount to as much as 4.2% of GDP (annualized). The&nbsp;effect on quarterly growth rates (rather than levels) could be even&nbsp;greater. If this were allowed to occur, it could lead to a rapid downturn&nbsp;in economic activity if not reversed very quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>And more detail....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A very short delay past the&nbsp;October deadline—for instance, a few days—could delay the payment of some obligations&nbsp;already incurred and would create instability in the financial markets. This uncertainty alone could weigh on growth.</p> <p>But a long delay—for example, several weeks—would likely result in a government&nbsp;shutdown much broader than the one that started October 1. In the current shutdown,&nbsp;there is ample cash available to pay for government activities, but the administration has&nbsp;lost its authority to conduct &quot;non-essential&quot; discretionary programs which make up about&nbsp;15% of the federal budget.</p> <p>By contrast, if the debt limit were not increased, after late&nbsp;October the administration would still have authority to make most of its scheduled&nbsp;payments, but would not have enough cash available to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52527967e4b041f09f138ad5\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:24:41.487+01:00\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">US deadlock hits euro investors</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1b0128f8-a791-467e-8c2f-2c8feb559585\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381137864207/c92997d0-b72a-45e4-b1a7-acc6724d5a32-460x264.png\" alt=\"Eurozone investor confidence\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Sentix</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>The US government shutdown debacle has hit&nbsp;</strong><strong>investor confidence within the eurozone</strong>,&nbsp;according to the latest data from German research firm <strong>Sentix.</strong></p> <p>Sentix's monthly measure of investor sentiment dropped to 6.1, from 6.5 in September.

        "headline":"City optimism highest since mid-1990s as economy recovers",
        "body":"<p>Britain's bankers are feeling increasingly optimistic, as the financial sector reaps the benefits of the upturn in the wider economy.</p><p>In its latest quarterly survey of the industry, business group the CBI says the turnaround in confidence among banks, insurers and City fund managers over the three months to September was the fastest since the mid-1990s. Business volumes at banks fell over the quarter but firms across the sector as a whole told PWC, which compiles the survey, that they expect revenue and profits to increase over the next three months. They are also hiring staff and investing in IT to cope with increased volumes of business.</p><p>Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics, said: \"with optimism rising and jobs and profitability growing, this is an encouraging quarter.\"</p><p>News of the more upbeat mood among City firms echoes a series of other surveys that have added weight to George Osborne's assertion that the UK has, \"turned a corner\".</p><p>City consultancy Capital Economics has revised its UK growth forecasts, upwards after a string of optimistic data. Capital, which expects GDP to expand by 1.5% this year and 2.5% in 2014, rejects the argument that the recovery is based on too much borrowing, or an unsustainable housing bubble.</p><p>\"The housing market has played a minor role in pushing up consumer confidence and consumer spending. And with net mortgage lending close to zero, there is little  evidence that the recovery is built on a renewed accumulation of debt either,\" Capital's analysts say.</p><p>To support the recovery further, the government has announced that it will inject a further £100m into a new batch of Enterprise Zones to boost transport and telecommunications links. The fledgling zones, which began life in 2011 offering tax breaks, looser planning restrictions and infrastructure subsidies, will be consulted from today on the type of infrastructure spending that is most needed over the coming year. New sites in Cheshire, Essex, Cornwall, Gosport, Hereford and the Humber Estuary could bebefit from the extra cash.</p><p>Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: \"The Zones are showing progress with over 180 businesses, £500m of private sector investment and nearly 4,000 jobs, and many more in the pipeline.\"</p><p>\"We want to help them grow further and faster and this extra £100 million investment will ensure they have the infrastructure in place to successfully attract even more businesses and create many more local jobs.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419196150|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|ff7541657e941165a995a7651faa1e872ff86423 -->",

Japan Airlines has the option to buy a further 25.</p><p>It is a significant win for Airbus and the A350, which is designed to be more fuel efficient. The aircraft is a direct competitor of Boeing's Dreamliner, which has been bit by safety and technical issues this year.</p><p>Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines (JAL), said the A350 fleet would allow the company to take advantage of \"new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased\".</p><p>The new JAL Airbus fleet is scheduled to be operational from 2019, gradually replacing its ageing fleet over a six-year period.</p><p>Of the 31 aircraft ordered, 18 will be A350-900s, which typically offer three classes of seating and carry more than 300 passengers.</p><p>The remaining 13 will be A350-1000s, which seat 350 passengers on longer flights.</p><p>Fabrice Bregier, the Airbus president and chief executive, said the order marked a \"new chapter\" for the aircraft maker in Japan.</p><p>Airbus has now received orders for more than 750 A350s from 38 customers worldwide and it is hoped that the first of the new aircraft will be ready for commercial service in the second half of 2014.</p><p>News of the order was also welcomed by British company Rolls-Royce, which will supply its Trent engine for all 31 aircraft.</p><p>In a separate announcement Rolls said it had won two contracts, with a combined value of up to $496m, to support T56 engines on US government aircraft.</p><p>Under the six-year contract the FTSE 100 company will supply parts and field and engineering support for thousands of T56 engines, which have been in production since the 1950s.</p><p>The contract, awarded by the Defence Logistics Agency, will support around 1,000 C-130, P-3 and C-2 aircraft in service with the US Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Customs and Border Control as well as international fleets.</p><p>Rolls was also handed a contract worth up to $90m by the US Navy, involving engine repairs for E-2 Hawkeye aircraft, which are powered by two T56-A-427 engines.</p><p>The five-year contract is renewable annually and is valued at $17m for the first year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419229282|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|937ee8c8013f5013bc14f458bb9212bd9d50a02e -->",

        "headline":"Marks &amp; Spencer slides on sales fears as US shutdown hits FTSE again",
        "body":"<p>With markets nervous again as the US government shutdown continues and the country's debt ceiling deadline edges ever nearer, it is a UK retailer leading the FTSE 100 fallers.</p><p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> is down nearly 3%, 14p lower at 480p after a downbeat note from Credit Suisse. Analyst Simon Irwin put an underperform rating and 425p price target on the shares, saying:</p><p><blockquote>We believe that the second quarter has been slower than expected for M&amp;S's UK general merchandise so we are cutting second quarter like for like forecasts from +0.5% to -1.5%, and with higher mark-down over the summer and an earlier mid- season sale, we now forecast first half general merchandise gross margin -40 basis points (versus full year guidance +30-50 basis points).<br /><br />While the long-awaited autumn/winter ranges show some signs of improvement we don't not believe they are sufficient to transform like for like sales or margins, over the next year given that the slow migration of supply chain and IT continues to constrain the ability to trade the business. In the mean time, the bulk of the planned £350m of benefits continue to swallowed up (including an additional £100m of depreciation over two years) making it increasingly hard for management to surprise on operating expenditure.<br /><br />Having risen 30% year to date, [the shares] look overbought (as does much of the sector), particularly given the likelihood of further pressure on earnings. <br /></blockquote></p><p>He forecast first half profits of £235m, down 20% year on year:</p><p><blockquote>Although we are not cutting full year forecasts (clean pretax profit of £668m, up 0.5% year on year), first half profits would represent 35% of our full year forecast which compares with an average of 46% over the past 7 years, and second half profits will therefore have to increase by 18% year on year. This is just possible, if everything goes right in general merchandise, food and international. However after three years of steady downgrades, and a relatively wide consensus range, the top end of the range (more than £700m pretax profit) looks set to fall even if management maintain guidance on costs and gross margins.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 54.54 points at 6399.34 as US politicians continue to argue over the budget, ahead of the 17 October deadline for resolving the debt ceiling problem. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:</p><p><blockquote>The congressional stalemate shows no signs of progress with House Speaker Boehner adamant that a clean spending bill will not be approved while Treasury Secretary Lew says congress is playing with fire putting the nation's sovereign reputation at risk, on top of President Obama's highlighting of the potential impact on fourth quarter GDP.<br /><br />There are also fears that October could be a lost month for important official US macro data meaning November lacks a comparable and pushes analysis into December, possibly even January. Rating agency Moody's says US default is extremely unlikely with debt payments being made even after the deadline.<br /><br />With the Fed/markets using data to decide/price in policy changes and tapering, the waters may still remain muddied even after a budget/debt ceiling solution.

        "body":"<p>The current<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/us-shutdown-explainer-non-americans\"> US government shutdown</a> has little impact on Australia, but if the US hits the debt ceiling Australia will feel the consequences of a<a href=\"http://voteview.com/images/Senate_means_2013.png\"> bitterly partisan</a> US political system.</p> <p>One of the more ironic aspects of the US government shutdown is that if it goes on for much longer, the government won’t be able to calculate its economic impact because it won’t be able to collect the data.</p> <p>Last Friday was supposed to be the most recent release of US jobs figures, and yet those logging on to the<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\"> BLS website</a> would have seen this:</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e48a67da-eccb-498e-aaeb-cdb553b5e125\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381130287519/a067e7aa-6a52-43b4-bab0-f2d500b5ccd2-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Bureau of Labor Statistics web page\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</figcaption> </figure> <p>During the shutdown the BLS won’t be able to collect the data to calculate the employment figures. Similarly the<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/\"> Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> is also shut down, which rather makes collating data for the GDP figures a tad tricky.</p> <p>But for Australians the big issue is not so much the shutdown. Costly as it is to the American economy – wiping about 0.1% of GDP growth each week – it does not have a great direct impact outside its borders. After all there are not many Australians employed by the US government or about to go to a US national park this weekend. The real bitter pill for the rest of the world (and US) comes in a couple weeks when the US reaches its debt ceiling.</p> <p>The debt ceiling is often lazily referred to as the US government’s credit card limit, but it is not about giving the US government the right to spend more, but the ability to borrow to pay off spending it has already undertaken.</p> <p>The debt ceiling is currently at $US16.699tn, and was actually reached in May but the US treasury was able to employ some “<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44324\">extraordinary measures</a>” to keep borrowing. These measures will run out on 17 October.</p> <p>At that point the US will no longer be able to borrow money to pay its bills. In the short run that is OK, because the US government gets enough cash from tax revenue to cover its expenses. But on 1 November it gets a bill for US$67bn for social security, medicare and veterans benefits. By 15 November the US government will be short about US$108bn. And that means defaulting on its payments.</p> <p>No one really knows what will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised. Views range from,<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfinger/2013/10/04/the-u-s-debt-ceiling-fallacy-agreement-or-not-there-will-be-no-default/\"> it’ll be fine</a>, to<a href=\"http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/economic-armageddon-a-list-of-what-happens-if-the-us-defaults/30828\"> it’ll be Armageddon</a>. The US Treasury for its part has put<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Report-on-Macroeconomic-Effect-of-Debt-Ceiling-Brinkmanship.aspx\"> out a paper</a> that paints a pretty scary picture.</p> <p>After looking at what has occurred in 2011 when the US nearly reached the debt limit, it concluded that a debt default “could have a catastrophic effect on not just financial markets but also on job creation, consumer spending and economic growth”.</p> <p>It also noted that “many private-sector analysts believing that it would lead to events of the magnitude of late 2008 or worse, and the result then was a recession more severe than any seen since the Great Depression”.</p> <p>And just in case you are a glass-half-full kind of person and you still have some optimism, the report ends on this less than upbeat note: “Considering the experience of countries around that world that have defaulted on their debt... [the] consequences, including high interest rates, reduced investment, higher debt payments, and slow economic growth, could last for more than a generation.”</p> <p>Cheery.</p> <p>Thus far the markets have been rather sanguine. The<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield\"> US Treasury 10-year bond yields</a> are lower now than they were a month ago – suggesting investors are not too spooked about the long-term US economy. There is also a sense that investors are a bit jaded – the debt ceiling fight is now becoming an annual event.</p> <p>But in the past few days, investors have become very worried about holding US treasury bonds which mature in the next month.</p> <p>The spread of the six-month to one-month treasury bonds fell off a cliff, to the point where investors are now demanding a higher return for buying a one-month US treasury bond than for a six-month.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0d54abba-d8a0-48f0-8f20-342f478441e1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381130642571/fa3ba318-a8a8-41a3-ac74-da75a585468b-460x248.jpeg\" alt=\"Spread of US six-month to one-month bonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"248\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Source: US Treasury</figcaption> </figure> <p>Should the default actually occur you could expect those jaded investors would suddenly get very alert. A US government default would put the world economy into uncharted waters. Around 87 % of all foreign exchange transactions involve US dollars. If the US government can no longer guarantee it will pay its bills (even for a short time), that rather upsets the integrity of the entire system.</p> <p>In 2011 when the debt ceiling was almost breached, the US’s credit rating was downgraded to AA. It hurt US confidence, put a big hand brake on economic growth, and the turmoil on financial markets reduced American household wealth by around US$2.4tn.</p> <p>For Australia, in 2011 our dollar at the time soared to US$1.10 as the American currency lost value. With the value of our dollar already rising the last thing our manufacturing sector needs is for the dollar to be given a boost.</p> <p>For the moment most expect congress to back down and raise the debt ceiling (or perhaps even suspend it for a few more months like they did<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/22/suspending-the-debt-ceiling-is-a-great-idea-lets-do-it-forever/\"> last year</a>).</p> <p>But Australians should hope that the US gets its act in order soon. While it is nice to think that we are now bound to China, a look over the past 20 years shows that aside from extraordinary circumstances – such as the dotcom bubble and September 11 attack, and our mining boom in 2006 – Australia and the US’s GDP growth is quite closely linked.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-364611b3-ad70-41e8-adde-3e10059319b2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381130825832/724cd7db-e430-448a-8a37-d5b81e01245b-460x245.jpeg\" alt=\"US and Australian GDP growth\" width=\"460\" height=\"245\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Source: OECD</figcaption> </figure> <p>Our economy is like a dinghy in the ocean of the international economy. If the US scuttles itself though political intransigence, without another mining boom, little HMAS Australia would find it tough not to get sucked into the vortex as USS America goes down.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419208785|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|cbd97396f40e6400716ea170486e1941220a62a4 -->",

        "headline":"World Bank cuts China growth forecasts",
        "body":"<p>The World Bank lowered its 2013 and 2014 economic growth forecasts for China and most of developing East Asia on Monday. It cited slower growth in the world's most populous nation as well as weaker commodity prices that have hurt exports and investments in countries such as Indonesia.</p> <p>\"Developing East Asia is expanding at a slower pace as China shifts from an export-oriented economy and focuses on domestic demand,\" the World Bank said in its latest East Asia Pacific Economic Update report.</p> <p>\"Growth in larger middle-income countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand is also softening in light of lower investment, lower global commodity prices and lower-than-expected growth of exports,\" it added.</p> <p>The Washington-based development bank now expects developing East Asia to expand by 7.1% this year and by 7.2% in 2014, down from its April estimate of 7.8% and 7.6%, respectively.</p> <p>On China, the World Bank said the massive, investment-heavy stimulus program supported by credit expansion had run its course, and policymakers must focus on containing the rapid growth of credit and tighten financial supervision.</p> <p>It added local government debt was a concern, given the complexity and opacity of municipal finances, and said they should be reformed \"with clear rules on borrowing, on allowed sources of borrowing, on debt resolution, and on the disclosure of comprehensive financial accounts by local governments\".</p> <p>\"The rapid expansion of shadow banking poses serious challenges, since shadow banking is closely linked to the banking system, is less regulated, and operates with implicit guarantees from banks and local governments,\" the World Bank said.</p> <p>But it added local governments in China had significant assets to meet liabilities as they held land reserves worth 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) as well as shares in state-owned enterprises worth a similar amount.</p> <p>China had shown some progress in rebalancing its economy, it added, with consumption contributing more to quarterly growth than investment in the two years up to the first quarter of 2013 and services accounting for a larger share of GDP.</p> <p>\"Still, the economy has yet to make the decisive turn toward consumer-based growth,\" the World Bank said.</p> <p>It now expects the Chinese economy to expand by 7.5% this year, down from its April forecast of 8.3% and below the International Monetary Fund's most recent forecast of 7.75%.</p> <p>China's 2014 growth is estimated at 7.7%, the World Bank said, down 0.3 percentage point from the previous prediction.</p> <p>The IMF is due to publish its new world economic outlook on Tuesday ahead of the fund's annual meeting.</p> <p>Turning to Indonesia, the World Bank said investment growth reached a three-year low in the second quarter and is likely to face headwinds from interest rate hikes in response to rising inflation and capital outflows as well as from a slowdown in foreign direct investment and regulatory uncertainties.</p> <p>\"Lower global commodity prices have dampened export receipts and slowed private investment in the capital-intensive resource sectors of the Indonesian economy, depressing overall growth,\" the World Bank said.</p> <p>The World Bank cut its growth forecast for Indonesia to 5.6% for 2013 and 5.3% next year, down from its previous estimates of 6.2% and 6.5%, respectively.</p> <p>As for the Philippines, investments slowed in the second quarter after a strong first three months of the year. But remittances from Filipinos working abroad boosted consumption, which contributed three-fourths to growth in the April-June.</p> <p>The World Bank expects the Philippines to grow by 7% this year, much faster than the April forecast of 6.2%. For 2014, the economy would probably expand by 6.7%, better than the previous estimate of 6.4%.</p> <p>The World Bank said its latest regional forecasts faced greater likelihood of being revised downwards than upwards, citing potential headwinds such as a less orderly tapering of the U.S. Federal Reserve's stimulus programme and a prolonged fiscal deadlock in Washington.</p> <p>World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Bert Hofman added, however, that the reversal of capital flows in developing East Asia may be offset by Japan's new strategy to exit deflation and revive growth, commonly referred to as \"Abenomics\".</p> <p>Japan's efforts to reflate its economy could spill over to emerging Asian economies through expanded bank lending, portfolio rebalancing, and increased outward foreign direct investment, he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419211648|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|320ebd3aa12b62a57decba575fe7a5dd5bbb2fa4 -->",

        "body":"<p>The chief executive of Qantas, Alan Joyce, says he is comfortable that new Boeing 787 Dreamliners being delivered to budget carrier Jetstar are extremely safe despite some reliability issues.</p> <p>The first of the high-tech jets for Jetstar's international routes are due to be delivered to Melbourne on Wednesday, only weeks after budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle demanded Boeing take back a plane and fix a faulty hydraulic pump after only 30 days in service.</p> <p>Visiting Boeing's factory in Seattle, Joyce said: \"It's important to distinguish reliability from safety. Sometimes in people's minds they can be really concerned.</p> <p>\"Reliability in new aircraft takes a while to get up there. It's not a safety issue.</p> <p>\"We're very comfortable this is an extremely safe aircraft.\"</p> <p>The Boeing 787 vice-president and general manager, Larry Loftis, said the ambition to build the most technologically advanced aircraft in five decades had been a logistical challenge since production began in 2007.</p> <p>\"From a reliability standpoint ... we're working to make sure the airplane continually improves and becomes more and more reliable,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We put a lot of new technology in this aircraft and over-estimated the ability to bring this new technology to market in the timeframe to which we committed.\"</p> <p>The Dreamliner is 20% more fuel efficient than comparable wide-bodied aircraft with about 300 seats. It uses carbon fibre composite graphite instead of traditional aluminium.</p> <p>But 50 Dreamliner jets were grounded in January when lithium ion batteries caught fire on two Japanese airlines.</p> <p>They returned to the skies in April but an emergency transmitter on a Boeing 787 caught fire at London's Heathrow airport in July on an Ethiopian Airlines plane.</p> <p>Qantas has ordered 14 Boeing 787s for Jetstar, which are being delivered until late 2015.</p> <p>The Dreamliner deliveries will enable Qantas to take 11 Airbus A330s from Jetstar as part of a plan to retire older, fuel-burning Boeing 767s.</p> <p>Joyce said the lighter Dreamliners would reduce fuel costs in the Qantas group, and help enable the airline to have an even younger fleet than Singapore Airlines \"in the next couple of years, which we haven't seen in a long time\".</p> <p>Jetstar expects to begin commercial flights abroad in November, with limited domestic flights for test purposes, following testing by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in Australia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419204928|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|e0731e2f85cb72e973b9927421945fc407f675fa -->",

        "body":"<p>Retail sales growth eased back last month as clothes stores suffered amid volatile weather, according to new figures.</p><p>BDO's monthly high street tracker showed like-for-like sales across the retail sector, excluding grocery and online sales, increased by 0.6% last month - down sharply on the 3.5% surge recorded in August.  Fashion sales fell 2.1% in September in a \"challenging\" month for clothing retailers as they were buffeted by changeable weather conditions, according to the accountancy and business advisory firm BDO.</p><p>It added that sales progress was held back as many firms chose not to launch heavy discounts in favour of protecting their profits.  Retailers were also up against strong comparatives from a year earlier, when widespread discounting saw sales leap 3.5% higher.</p><p>Don Williams, national head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said: \"September saw a game of nerve being played, with bolder retailers driving footfall and conversion imaginatively rather than resorting solely to price led promotion.\"</p><p>BDO added that retail sales were moving back into a \"more regular pattern of growth\".  Homewares retailers continued to enjoy double digit sales growth, up 12.8%, thanks to Britain's housing market revival, helping non-fashion sales overall rise 3.7%.  Online sales growth slipped to 23.7% from 26.7% in August, the report found.</p><p>BDO tracked sales at around 85 non-grocery retailers with annual sales of between £5m and £500m.</p><p>Official figures showed retail sales volumes fell 0.9% month-on-month in August as spend on food slumped after the barbecue boost from July's heatwave.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192019|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|5e12d97d9157b589b2376ae9acfe8bb60fb416e6 -->",

        "headline":"FTSE 100 companies still 66 female directors short of boardroom target",
        "body":"<p>Concerns continue to be raised about the number of female executives at the top of British business after the latest update on progress towards the government's target of a quarter of the seats in the UK's biggest boardrooms being held by women.</p><p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, said appointing non-executive directors was \"not an end in itself\" as data shows that the main area of progress is in non-executive appointments, with much slower improvement in executive posts.</p><p>The latest half-yearly report on the target set by Lord Davies for FTSE 100 boards to be 25% female by 2015 shows that the proportion of women has increased to 19%, up from 12.5% when the former banker first reported in February 2011.</p><p>Data compiled for the government by Professional Boards Forum BoardWatch shows the proportion of non-executive directors has reached nearly 24% – within a whisker of the Davies target and up from 15.6%. But the proportion of women holding executive positions at FTSE 100 companies is 6.1%, compared with 5.5% when the target was set. The number of all-male boards in the FTSE 100 has risen to six in the past six months, although there were&nbsp;21 all-male boards when the target was set.</p><p>Despite the disparity between non-executive and executive appointments, Cable said the overall total was encouraging. \"We have until 2015 to reach our target of 25% of women on the boards of listed companies which Lord Davies set us two years ago. With today's encouraging figures, I am confident we can get over the finish line. But appointing more women as non-executive directors is not an end in itself. This is about more talented women getting executive experience, so that they will not only advise but run this country's great companies,\" he said.</p><p>Heather Jackson, founder of the Women's Business Forum, which holds its fourth meeting this week, said: \"Simply putting women on boards is a short-term, cosmetic solution. What we really need to be concentrating on is fixing and developing the leaking pipeline of female talent at middle management.\"</p><p>In the FTSE 250, the rung below the FTSE 100, the proportion of female directors is 15%, up from 7.8%, but the proportion of executive directors has fallen to 5.4% from 5.7% – and there are 51 all-male boards. Companies in the FTSE 100 would have to appoint an extra 66 women to reach the 25% target, and the FTSE 250&nbsp;would need to attract an extra 202 women.</p><p>The number of female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies is down to just three: Angela Ahrendts of Burberry, Alison Copper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall of easyJet. Their number has been depleted by the departure of Marjorie Scardino from Pearson and Cynthia Carroll from Anglo American.</p><p>The 30% Club, which campaigns for greater boardroom representation for women, has set up a mentoring scheme to try to channel the \"pipeline\" of women in middle management who might reach the top and push forward more women into executive rules.</p><p>Sir Roger Carr, the City grandee who is scheduled to speak at the Women's Business Forum, said : \"After a fast start, the speed of female board appointments has become more pedestrian. We need to pick up the pace if British business is to benefit from diversity by choice rather than enforcement by quota.\"</p><p>Cable has already written to the bosses of the all-male boardrooms in an attempt to convince them to hire more women. He also appointed former banker Charlotte Sweeney to review the voluntary code of conduct adopted by headhunters who have pledged to ensure women account for 30% of the candidates on long-lists drawn up for company chairman.</p><p>But although some companies are still all male, 31 FTSE 100 companies have reached the 25% target – including betting firm William Hill, advertising group WPP&nbsp;and the National Grid – and 13 have achieved 30% or more, led&nbsp;by drinks&nbsp;group Diageo with 44% and&nbsp;consumer goods group Unilever with&nbsp;36%.</p><p>Davies, a former boss of Standard Chartered and lined up to become a non-executive director of a branch network being spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"We have now moved to a place where it is unacceptable for the voice of women to be absent from the boardroom.\" Davies is leading a consortium that includes the Bank of England that is investing in the 314 branches being sold by RBS and which will eventually be floated off. The shadow board of the branch network, which will be known as Williams &amp; Glyn's, does not contain any women although Davies has said this will be addressed. Cable and his ministers are to hold a series of meetings with FTSE 350 companies to try to tackle this issue.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194784|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|feb9bf77fe35592f24eb28ae09c19e4b28762061 -->",

        "headline":"Iceland rises from the ashes of banking collapse",
        "body":"<p>A new mood of proud nationalism is emerging in economically resurgent Iceland after an out-of-control banking system sank the country into financial meltdown exactly five years ago. Riding this wave of confidence is 38-year-old prime minister, Sigmundur Davíd Gunnlaugsson, elected in April on populist promises of mortgage relief for every homeowner.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson earned his spurs in years of outspoken campaigning against the foreign creditors who still haunt Iceland, particularly the British and the Dutch governments, which intervened after the collapse of Landsbanki – the bank behind Icesave – on 7 October 2008.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary British and Dutch savers had previously switched their savings into online Icesave accounts, attracted by market-beating interest rates and promises that: \"You can also rest assured that with Icesave you are offered the same level of financial protection as every bank in the UK.\"</p><p>When the crash came, however, Iceland's deposit guarantee proved worthless, forcing the UK and the Netherlands to use their own taxpayer funds to compensate ordinary savers and sparking a poisonous diplomatic row.</p><p>It was a spat that, against the odds, Iceland won. While many other politicians in Iceland had urged a policy of appeasing the enraged British and Dutch governments, Gunnlaugsson had insisted they should go hang. \"Icelanders, as descendants of the Vikings, are highly individualistic and have difficulty putting up with authorities, let alone oppression,\" he said in one of his first speeches as prime minister on Iceland's Independence Day in June this year.</p><p>\"This was clearly demonstrated in the Icesave dispute, in which the people rejected an agreement they considered unfair. This was later upheld by an international court, which showed that the people's sense of justice was a reliable indicator to follow.\"Having helped win the famous Icesave victory from outside government, Gunnlaugsson has promised to carry that uncompromising approach with him as prime minister, hinting at a new wave of attacks on the interests of foreign creditors to Iceland's three failed banks: Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki. Between them, these institutions had assets more than nine times the size of Iceland's economic output when they failed in 2008.</p><p>From the wreckage, only three modest domestic banks emerged, allowing Iceland to keep functioning. The country was also able to let its overheated currency devalue, and impose capital controls to bring some stability.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, international bondholders and depositors were left out in the cold, waiting to recover what scraps they could from the banks' administration processes. Five years on and they are still waiting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gunnlaugsson's main pre-election pledges were to squeeze these foreign creditors – characterised as \"hedge funds\" or \"vulture funds\" – in order to bankroll a mortgage relief programme for all homeowners and a string of pro-business tax cuts.</p><p>Political opponents savaged the pledge. \"It was like promising to bring back [the boom of] 2007,\" reflects the Left-Green former finance minister Steingrímur Sigfússon. But the Icelandic electorate loved it.</p><p>And with creditors' interests still locked in slow administration processes, and behind tight capital control walls, Gunnlaugsson believes he has a strong hand to play.</p><p>During the election campaign this year, he said: \"This does not revolve around the confiscation of assets. The loss has already been incurred. It was mostly borne by foreign creditors who have recognised the loss and got out. In their place came hedge funds that have profited enormously — on paper — from the collection now of much that was considered lost and written off …</p><p>\"It cannot be accepted that Icelanders should slave away to increase such collections and regain that which had already been lost without getting any share in it.\"</p><p>Creditor groups remain circumspect, keen to get into private discussions with the new administration as quickly as possible. Behind the scenes, however, they are examining their legal options carefully should Gunnlaugsson's aggression go too far. Their goal is to strike a deal that will allow foreign creditors to access more than £9bn of foreign currency assets tied up with the three banks' administrators and barred from exiting Iceland. \"We have been attempting to engage for some time and fail to understand the lack of progress from the authorities,\" said one source close to the creditors.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson's rise to power shocked some observers outside Iceland, who thought the electorate might give their backing to the Left-Green-led coalition that had taken power iafter the banking crash and steered the country through the strictures of an International Monetary Fund programme, and back to growth.</p><p>Instead, the Left-Greens suffered the heaviest defeat in Icelandic history after an election campaign dominated not by economic achievements but by the fallout from the Icesave saga.</p><p>Bouncing back into office came a coalition of the two rightwing parties – the Independence Party and Gunnlaugsson's Progressive party – that had been in charge for much of Iceland's discredited boom years between 2003 and 2008. \"The old rascals are back,\" laughs Geir Haarde, former Independence Party leader and prime minister at the time of the crash.</p><p>The previous government had twice negotiated terms under which Iceland would repay the UK and the Netherlands, with interest, for the cost of bailing out Icesave savers. It was made plain to ministers at the time that continued IMF support depended on such a deal.</p><p>But both proposals, despite being passed by the Icelandic parliament, were overwhelmingly defeated in public referenda thanks in part Gunnlaugsson. Popular opinion in Iceland had railed against what Gunnlaugsson grass roots campaign group InDefence portrayed as bullying forces from overseas, set on extracting reparations from Reykjavik akin to those sought from Germany in the Treaty of Versailles.</p><p>InDefence attacked Britain in particular, accusing Gordon Brown's government of deliberately damaging Iceland's standing in international markets in 2008 by using anti-terrorism laws to freeze the UK assets of Landsbanki. The bank, together with Iceland's finance ministry, was even place on a UK list of financially sanctioned regimes alongside North Korea and al-Qaida.</p><p>As time went on, however, eminent economists began to reassess Iceland's reputation as a pariah state, contrasting it favourably with, among others, Ireland, which had been similarly laid low by an outsized banking sector and forced to seek emergency help from the IMF.</p><p>\"Where everyone else bailed out the bankers and made the public pay the price, Iceland let the banks go bust and actually expanded its social safety net,\" noted Paul Krugman, admiringly. Iceland, he found, had demonstrated the \"case for letting creditors of private banks gone wild eat the losses\".</p><p>Nobel prize winner Joeseph Stilitz agreed. \"What Iceland did was right. It would have been wrong to burden future generations with the mistakes of the financial system.\" For Financial Times economist Martin Wolf too, it was a triumph. \"Iceland let the creditors of its banks hang. Ireland did not. Good for Iceland!\" Less good, of course, for the foreign creditors. And Not all of the foreign creditors are the vulture funds Gunnlaugsson talks of. British and Dutch taxpayers still have significant exposure to the Landsbanki administration. As priority creditors they have had almost 55% of their claims repaid, though the remainder will take a good deal longer to be paid out. There are UK local authorities and charities, too, which entrusted more than £1bn with failed Icelandic banks and are still waiting to get much of their money back. Meanwhile, taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland had been one of the largest investors in Icelandic bank bonds, a position that has left it a non-priority claimant, expecting only minimal returns in its claims.</p><p>Until recently RBS had remained on the banks' creditor lists but sold its positions to distressed debt specialists earlier this year — at a heavy loss — as the outlook for creditors began to look more uncertain in the face of Gunnlaugsson's rising fortunes.</p><p>The Icelandic prime minister has promised to give further details of his populist programme for tax cuts and home loan debt relief next month, and will be under pressure to show how he expects to fund such moves. It remains to be seen if he gains more from squeezing foreign creditors trapped within Iceland's capital controls than he loses in terms of the damage to Iceland's reputation among international investors.</p><p>Last month Gunnlaugsson flew to London to address the Iceland Investment Forum, finishing his speech by declaring: \"Hope to see you, and your money, in Iceland.\"</p><p>The response, from an audience largely of Icelanders and representatives of the foreign creditors, was a ripple of nervous laughter. Gunnlaugsson will not want that laughter to grow any louder.</p><h2>Return to riches</h2><p>Icelanders are fast on their way back to becoming among the richest people in the world, just five years after experiencing one of the most dramatic financial meltdowns in history.</p><p>\"If you say Iceland was a ship, it [the 2008 banking crash] caused a lot of damage to the bridge, but the body of the ship and the engine were still in good order,\" said Geir Haarde, prime minister at the time. He added:  \"Our growth prospects for the future are tremendous.\"</p><p>Haarde's government was ousted three months after the crash in the face of noisy street demonstrations which became known as the \"pots and pans revolution\". A new Left-Green led coalition pushed the country through the strictures of an IMF bailout programme.</p><p>\"We raised almost every tax there was – and introduced new ones,\" recalled the then finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, adding that there were considerable cuts in public spending too as government debt swelled to eye-watering levels.</p><p>By August 2011, Iceland had graduated from its International Monetary Fund bailout programme with flying colours. \"We became a poster child for them,\" suggests Sigfusson, noting how the fund is still struggling to right many other sinking economies on Europe's peripheries.</p><p>Weeks after the IMF exit, a conference was held in Reykjavik, where the mood was close to celebratory. \"As the first country to experience the full force of the global economic crisis,\" the IMF said, \"Iceland is now held up as an example by some of how to overcome deep economic dislocation without undoing the social fabric.\"</p><p>Since then, with government borrowing receding, Iceland has been able to return to the international debt markets, and has begun repaying its emergency loans. Meanwhile, the economy – having shrunk more than 10% in two years – bounced in 2011 and 2012, and will grow by about 1.9% this year.</p><p>Many Icelanders wince at the suggestion that they have escaped lightly from their IMF ordeal. Disposable income fell by a quarter after the crash, and 30,000 people – one-tenth of the population – have fallen into serious loan default; thousands of homes have been repossessed.</p><p>But that is not the whole story. Throughout the crisis, the Icelandic population has maintained the lowest risk of poverty or social exclusion in Europe. Unemployment, which briefly rose to 9.2%, has dropped back to 5.1%. Inflation is falling back to its target range, and house prices in Reykjavik are on the rise. Credit rating agency Fitch gave this assessment of the recovery in February: \"The upgrade reflects the impressive progress Iceland continues to make ... [and] is underpinned by high income-per-capita levels. Rich natural resources, a young population and robust pension assets further support the rating.\"</p><p>Although Iceland has a small population of 317,000, supporting one of the smallest currencies in the world, its resources are mighty in comparison. One in 84 fish caught around the world is caught by Icelandic trawlers in the nation's rich north Atlantic waters. Meanwhile, glacial meltwater powers the nations hydro power stations and, together with geothermal generators, produce electricity five times the requirements of the local population.</p><p>Haarde, who has left politics, says: \"We are used to living quite well. Actually we were only set back a few years. Let's leave aside why this happened, and the blame. When the crisis came to Iceland we were fortunate enough to do what was necessary. The banks never closed, people were able to go to their banks and use their credit cards. There were older people who didn't even realize their had been a crisis.\"</p><p>• This article was amended </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192881|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|061665db362931f0f773e69b86350c23d47cbbd4 -->",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p><strong>• With little traction in Congress for a deal, the 2013 government shutdown appeared ready to barrel into the weekend.</strong> The House was <a href=\"http://reason.com/24-7/2013/10/04/house-to-open-saturday-to-try-to-end-shu\">to convene</a> Saturday. President Obama is speaking to the Associated Press for an interview to air Saturday.</p> <p><strong>• <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/360413/emerging-offer-robert-costa\">Rumors</a> swirled of a Republican <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/10/boehners-bait-and-switch.html\">proposal</a> taking shape that would clean up the shutdown,</strong> the debt ceiling, the sequester, and the debate over taxes and entitlements in one fell swoop. However there was no indication that Democrats were interested in hearing such a proposal.</p> <p>• <strong>The Democrats want a clean spending bill followed by a clean bill raising the debt ceiling followed by a budget deal.</strong> The Republicans want concessions on Obamacare and entitlements to be part of the deal(s) at some stage. For thumbnail insight into where the sides sit, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertcostaNRO/status/386180343499214848\">this Twitter conversation</a> between National Review writer Robert Costa and presidential advisor Dan Pfeiffer is recommended.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• The US Treasury is too short-handed to enforce sanctions on Iran and Syria, Democrats warned.</strong> Hundreds of thousands of federal employees remained on furlough. A roundup of agencies and departments affected by the shutdown <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/us-government-shutdown-services-affected\">is here</a>.</p> <p>• <strong>House Republicans passed or planned to pass at least 11 mini spending bills to fund slivers of government.</strong> The White House said it would sign one of them, to retroactively pay furloughed workers, but veto the others. The Obama administration deemed the process 'not serious or responsible.'</p> <p><strong>• Republicans seized on reports that an Obama official claimed &quot;we are winning&quot; the shutdown.</strong> &quot;This isn't some damn game,&quot; House speaker John Boehner said. The president agreed &quot;no one is winning.&quot;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• Markets were down</strong> and economic confidence as measured by Gallup was significantly down. The president canceled a trip to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</p> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T22:29:28.783+01:00\">at 5.29pm ET</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-524f2a45e4b041f09f1389dd\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T21:56:46.513+01:00\">4.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Well that's pretty good. <strong>From the National Weather Service,</strong> a federal agency that has been subject to furloughs and could face pay delays:&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MascoFromABC2/statuses/386228009910288384\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>National Weather Service <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Alaska&amp;src=hash\">#Alaska</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23governmentshutdown&amp;src=hash\">#governmentshutdown</a> humor.

The big deal could reportedly include an agreement to raise the debt ceiling or even modify the tax code.</p> <p>House speaker John Boehner is meeting this morning with his caucus in an attempt to outline such a deal. However, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-04/boehner-seeks-republican-unity-on-debt-ceiling-increase.html\">there are signs</a> that it will not be easy to get the Republicans in the House to agree on <del>anything</del> a catchall deal.</p> <p>Another catch: the Democratic Senate leadership&nbsp;has said they won’t take up any larger budget questions until the House passes a spending bill that doesn't mention Obamacare. The president has vowed not to horse-trade around the debt ceiling. &quot;There will be no negotiations over this,&quot; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/government-shutdown-third-day-live#block-524d8ddce4b0f459d922d158\">Obama said Thursday</a>.</p> <p>The president announced late Thursday that due to the shutdown he has canceled a trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that was to begin Sunday. Earlier in the week the White House had announced the trip would merely be shortened. Secretary of State John Kerry will attend in Obama's stead.</p> <p>Over the last two days the House has passed bills to fund chunks of government including veterans' services, national parks and museums, health research, the payroll of the National Guard and military reserve members and the municipality of the District of Columbia. Senate Democrats reject the bills out of hand, insisting on reopening all of government.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/statuses/386121859281870848\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Rep.

        "body":"<p>A slowing economy, sky-high debts and a weak banking sector mean Ireland will need support from the European Union when its current bailout ends later this year, the International Monetary Fund said in a report on Friday.</p><p>In a clear call for Brussels to accede to Irish demands for a credit line next year, the IMF warned that Dublin's recovery would be hampered without cheaper funding for its ailing banks.</p><p>The report will deal a blow to the Irish government, which is under pressure domestically to maintain business and consumer confidence in the face of significant economic headwinds. In particular, export growth, which has underpinned the economy's recovery, has fallen in 2013.</p><p>The IMF said that while exports had picked up moderately in recent months, the recovery would not stop Ireland's debts hitting 123% of GDP by the end of the year. Making matters worse, the poor state of the country's banks is holding back the domestic economy.</p><p>\"Irish banks face weak profitability that hinders their capacity to revive lending. European support to lower banks' market funding costs could help sustain domestic demand recovery in the medium term, protecting debt sustainability and financial market confidence,\" it said.</p><p>The IMF has conducted 11 reports on Ireland's economic recovery since it joined a three-way bailout of the country with the EU and the European Central Bank in 2010.</p><p>Ireland would be the first bailed-out eurozone country to wean itself off emergency aid if it exits the €85bn scheme on schedule at the end of this year.</p><p>The IMF said Dublin was on track to meet its obligations under the deal, but \"near-term prospects are weaker and significant fiscal, financial sector and unemployment challenges remain\".</p><p>Ireland was forced to seek help after a property crash left its banks massively under-capitalised and the state's finances collapsed.</p><p>Since then it has stuck rigorously to the recipe of austerity laid out in the programme by its \"troika\" of lenders.</p><p>The EU is desperate for Ireland to exit the rescue smoothly to show the tough-love approach can succeed, given the struggles of fellow bailout recipients Greece and Portugal and deep-rooted public dissatisfaction across the region.</p><p>Ireland has met nearly all its funding needs through next year by issuing debt periodically over the last 12 months, having issued a 10-year bond in March for the first time since being locked out of markets in late 2010.</p><p>Yet banks continue to shun calls from households and businesses for easier credit conditions while struggling with low profits and a ratio of bad loans that has reached 26%.</p><p>Unemployment also remains a huge problem. A fall in the jobless rate from 15% to 13.7% since early 2012 has eased the social security burden but 58% of those without work are considered long-term unemployed, \"posing a risk to Ireland's growth potential\", said the IMF.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419094979|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|9c2280ec6563d84a4c4728872810eb80f145f92f -->",

        "body":"<p>The price of Bitcoin, the anonymous peer-to-peer digital currency, plummeted after the alleged founder of the online drugs marketplace Silk Road was arrested in San Francisco.</p> <p>On Wednesday afternoon the price of one Bitcoin (BTC) was $145.70 on Mt Gox, one of the largest exchanges for the currency.</p> <p>After the news that Ross Ulbricht had been arrested and the Silk Road site seized, the exchange rate plummeted to a low of $109.76, before recovering to $124.00 late on Thursday.</p> <h2>Bitcoin's record high was $266</h2> <p>In the history of the notoriously volatile currency, Wednesday’s fluctuations are minor. Bitcoin has experienced two major booms and busts, one in 2011 when the value of one Bitcoin went from $2 to $30 and back in little more than six months, and another earlier this year, when the price shot from $13 to a high of $266, before dropping back to a low of $50.</p> <p>Even on a slow trading period, Bitcoin remains extremely volatile. It is not uncommon to see the currency gain or lose 6% or 7% of its value over the course of a day with no obvious news event driving the change. <a href=\"http://www.bespokeinvest.com/thinkbig/2011/7/28/sp-500-average-daily-change.html\">The average daily change of the S&amp;P 500 is a tenth of that</a>.</p> <p>Bitcoin and Silk Road are closely linked. The site, which enables users to anonymously order drugs, guns, and more through the postal service, only takes payments in the digital currency. In doing so, it makes it significantly harder for authorities to follow the money to discover the real identities of buyers and sellers.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ee9ae5eb-6e41-4dab-8a6a-e283f6fd3180\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380825161439/baf49827-dad5-4372-9ebe-a0408cc1cc2a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bitcoin is being accepted by some independent shops\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The FBI seized $3.25m worth of Bitcoin in the Silk Road haul. Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>The technology behind Bitcoin is similar to public-key encryption,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/03/algorithims-google-internet-search-security-onlin\">the algorithm behind most internet security</a>. Users have a 'wallet', which is a public address that can send and receive Bitcoins, and a private key with which they can access the wallet. So long as the link between a particular wallet and a user is not made public, the currency can remain fully anonymous.</p> <p>But if a Bitcoin wallet becomes associated with a particular person, some of the security benefits disappear. Because transactions between wallets are public,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/09/05/follow-the-bitcoins-how-we-got-busted-buying-drugs-on-silk-roads-black-market/\">it can then become possible to trace transactions</a>.</p> <p>“Obviously the major price drop we saw yesterday was people scrabbling for the exit,” says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, who describes Bitcoin as “intrinsically linked” to Silk Road. “You've bought Bitcoin as an investment, or you've bought it as a transactional medium. If it’s one, you’ve just seen a major marketplace shut down, and if it’s the other, the value has dropped suddenly. You will sell it.”</p> <h2>Price drop 'motivated by fear'</h2> <p>Emily Spaven, editor of the digital currency news website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.coindesk.com/\">CoinDesk</a>, agrees that fear is motivating the drop in price. “The price of Bitcoin has fallen since the closure of Silk Road, not because the website was the lynchpin of the Bitcoin ecosystem, but because some people are fearful that this is the beginning of the end.”</p> <p>Silk Road remained one of the most prominent large-scale operations that used Bitcoin, and the largest to exclusively require the use of the currency. While a number of establishments announced they would be accepting payments in Bitcoin, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/23/britains-first-bitcoin-pub\">a pub in Hackney, east London</a>, many customers appeared to be making the most of the novelty value only.</p> <p>As a result, the site seemed to provide a significant share of actual use of Bitcoin. Even so,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/files/pdfs/tech_reports/CMUCyLab12018.pdf\">one paper from 2012</a>&nbsp;(pdf) pegged the site as making up just 4.5% of the entire Bitcoin economy. Information&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/02/silk-road-ross-william-ulbricht-criminal-complaint\">from the FBI’s criminal complaint</a>&nbsp;suggests that the average daily volume of Silk Road trades is 10,000 BTC, again around 5% of the 200,000 BTC that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume?showDataPoints=false&amp;timespan=&amp;show_header=true&amp;daysAverageString=7&amp;scale=0&amp;address=\">the site blockchain.info</a>&nbsp;says is the low end of daily transactions in Bitcoin.</p> <h2>Bitcoin 'not reliant on Silk Road'</h2> <p>“The reality is, Silk Road doesn't play any part in a high proportion of Bitcoin users' lives,” says Spaven. “The Bitcoin economy certainly isn’t reliant on Silk Road; there are hundreds of other websites that accept Bitcoins and I'm confident the list of these will continue to grow.”</p> <p>Indeed, Spaven raises the possibility that the Silk Road bust could be a good thing for the currency. “If anything, the fall of Silk Road has done Bitcoin a favour. Hopefully now that the website no longer exists, people will start to see Bitcoin in a more positive light and appreciate the numerous benefits it offers.” The Reuters blogger Felix Salmon agrees, suggesting that until now, the fear of such a bust may have exerted a downward pressure on prices. “With Silk Road gone, a significant source of downside tail risk has now been effectively removed from the Bitcoinverse,”&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/10/02/the-fbi-and-the-legitimation-of-the-bitcoinverse/\">he writes</a>.</p> <p>The other question for the currency is what effect&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/alleged-silk-road-website-founder-arrested-bitcoin\">the FBI’s seizure of 26,000 Bitcoins</a>, worth around $3.25m at current prices, will have on its economy. If the bureau decides to auction off the seized assets, the glut in supply could temporarily depress prices, and the removal of such a large number from circulation is in effect a monetary tightening. But Cook points out that the quantity is still tiny compared to the total number of Bitcoins available, thought to be almost 12m. “In the grand scheme of things, it's not too much of a liquidity shock.”</p> <p>• How can the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/02/bitcoin-silk-road-how-to-seize\">&nbsp;FBI seize Bitcoins</a>?

        "body":"<p>BP has secured a victory in its battle to limit payouts over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, in a move that could save the company billions of dollars.</p><p>The British oil firm welcomed a ruling by the US court of appeals that will force a rethink on how compensation claims related to the disaster will be assessed.</p><p>The supreme court also ordered that payments must be stopped to people who did not suffer \"actual injury traceable to loss\" from the spill until cases have been properly heard and decided through the judicial process.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/sep/08/bp-oil-spill-report-live\" title=\"\">rig explosion killed 11 people</a> and caused damage to those earning a living from fishing and tourism-related businesses along the coast.</p><p>But BP has persistently argued that the formula for judging claims was too generous, resulting in payments to people who had not actually suffered from the explosion, including businesses that were located far inland but still claiming economic loss.</p><p>Circuit judge Edith Brown Clement said: \"There is no need to secure peace with those with whom one is not at war. The district court had no authority to approve the settlement of a class that included members that had not sustained losses at all, or had sustained losses unrelated to the oil spill, as BP alleges. If the administrator is interpreting the settlement to include such claimants, the settlement is unlawful.\"</p><p>The company had set aside $7.8bn (£4.8bn) for compensation claims but by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/30/bp-deepwater-compensation-fund-running-dry\" title=\"\">July the figure had risen to $9.6bn</a> and was set to rise significantly without court intervention. Claims administrator Patrick Juneau said that about $3.69bn had been paid out in compensation. BP has already incurred more than $42bn of charges for cleanup costs, fines and compensation related to the spill.</p><p>BP said in a statement on Thursday: \"[The] ruling affirms what BP has been saying since the beginning: claimants should not be paid for fictitious or wholly non-existent losses. We are gratified that the systematic payment of such claims by the claims administrator must now come to an end.\"</p><p>Stephen Herman, a lawyer representing a group of claimants, said the vast majority of claimants would still receive compensation despite the ruling. He said: \"We look forward to working with the claims administrator and the court to determine the best way to get the affected claims processed and paid as soon as possible.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the second phase of a separate trial over the spill began on 30 September. It focuses on how much oil was spilled and BP's effort to control the flow, which are crucial questions in determining the size of the fine that BP must pay for its role in the disaster. The justice department claims that 4.2m barrels of oil flowed from the Macondo well in the wake of the explosion, with BP claiming that the true figure was closer to 2.4m barrels.</p><p>Under the Clean Water Act, the company and its partners face fines of up to $1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled if they are found to have been negligent. The fines could rise to $4,300 per barrel if the judge is persuaded that BP and its partners' action constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418932896|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|f81b3ededf58d3653f4cbc7e9fd2dc25db3ab01f -->",

The growth areas were trade and transportation, which added 54,000 posts, professional and business services, which added 27,000 jobs, and construction, which added 16,000 posts. Some 4,000 jobs were lost in financial activities.</p><p>August's ADP jobs growth number was revised down to 159,000 from 176,000.</p><p>Mark Zandi, chief economist of  Moody's Analytics, ADP's partner on the report, said: \"The job market appears to have softened in recent months. Fiscal austerity has begun to take a toll on job creation. The run-up in interest rates may also be doing some damage to jobs in the financial services industry. While job growth has slowed, there remains a general resilience in the market. Job creation continues to be consistent with a slowly declining unemployment rate.\"</p><p>The shutdown has led the Labor Department to shelve its job report this week. Economists had been expecting the US to add 175,000 to 185,000 jobs to its nonfarm payroll figure in September. Last month the US added 169,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate dipped to 7.3%.</p><p>ADP's figures have tracked the Labor Department's in recent months but do not include government jobs. The federal and local governments continue to shed workers.</p><p>ADP said that small businesses were leading the recovery. Businesses with 49 or fewer employees added 74,000 jobs in September, while employment levels among medium-sized companies with 50-499 employees rose by 28,000 and employment at large companies – those with 500 or more employees – increased by 64,000. </p><p>The figure comes amid more signs that the recovery is continuing, albeit slowly. On Tuesday the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) announced an unexpected rise in manufacturing in September, showing American factories continued to grow orders even as the government shutdown loomed. The ISM's factory index rose to 56.2 in September, its highest since April 2011 and up from 55.7 a month earlier.</p><p>But economists are warning that the row over the federal budget threatens to hamper the recovery. If its spills over into the debate over raising the debt ceiling, PNC bank's chief economist Gus Faucher has warned it could \"all but wipe out\" the US's recovery.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418852928|2013-10-07T10:05:58Z|4d8dc4a305570864a68896a4cea55ad15e47ea89 -->",
