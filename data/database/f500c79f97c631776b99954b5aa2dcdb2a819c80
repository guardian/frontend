        "trailText":"UK to review EU ban after Cameron visits refugee camps as Turkey says it will ask Nato to put Patriot missiles along border",
        "headline":"Call to lift Syria arms embargo to aid rebels",
        "body":"<p>Britain is to review the EU arms embargo on Syria as part of a wholesale change in strategy in the wake of Barack Obama's re-election that could lead to the eventual arming of the rebel forces fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>As David Cameron said he would press Obama to make Syria a priority, No 10 officials indicated that the prime minister now wants to put every possible measure to remove Assad &quot;back on the table&quot;.</p><p>Cameron's visit to the Zaatari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan on Wednesday, in which he heard &quot;appalling stories&quot; of suffering, persuaded him that Britain and its allies need to review their strategy, a source said. Britain's national security council will discuss the crisis in special session next week.</p><p>It will include a review of the EU ban on providing weapons to all sides in Syria. Officials say that the embargo includes the principle of &quot;proportionality&quot; which suggests the restriction could be relaxed in the event of a humanitarian disaster.</p><p>Evidence of a British rethink on the crisis came on a day when rebels fired mortars at a presidential palace in Damascus and as different elements of the divided Syrian opposition met in the Qatari capital Doha to try to close ranks and form a transitional government for the post-Assad era.</p><p>In another indication of regional tensions, Turkey confirmed that it is to make an official request to Nato to station Patriot missiles along its border with Syria. The move follows several incidents of shelling across the 560-mile frontier. It could also be linked to the ideas of establishing a safe zone or no-fly zone in the border area.</p><p>The moves by Britain and Turkey both seemed to anticipate a bolder approach from Obama to end the conflict that has claimed an estimated 35,000 lives since the bloodiest of the Arab spring uprisings erupted in March 2011. On average 100 to 150 people now die every day.</p><p>The text of the EU embargo, agreed two months after the conflict began, says: &quot;By way of derogation … the competent authorities in the member states&nbsp;… may authorise the sale, supply, transfer or export of equipment which might be used for internal repression, under such conditions as they deem appropriate, if they determine that such equipment is intended solely for humanitarian or protective use.&quot;</p><p>Cameron made clear he believes that stage may have been reached after he visited the refugee camp, where 110,000 Syrians are sheltering. &quot;I think what I have seen and heard today is truly appalling,&quot; said. &quot;I think [with] a re-elected president [Obama] with a new mandate&nbsp;… it's really important to discuss what more we can do to help resolve the situation.&quot;</p><p>Underlining the shift, the foreign office announced on Wednesday that it will talk to &quot;military figures in the armed opposition&quot; though it insists it has no plans to arm the rebels – the suspicion of those who fear a rerun of Nato's intervention in Libya last year.</p><p>Previously the Foreign Office had sanctioned contact only with &quot;political representatives of armed Syrian opposition groups&quot;.</p><p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, said in a statement to MPs that Britain would &quot;adhere to our clearly stated policy of only supplying non-lethal support to the unarmed opposition&quot;.</p><p>But No 10 believes there is a mismatch in which the EU and the US provide only &quot;non-lethal&quot; help to the rebels while Russia and Iran provide resources and weapons to Syrian government forces.</p><p>It is understood that Britain may review the EU embargo as a tactical ploy to persuade the Russians and Chinese, who have pledged to veto any UN security council resolution, to change position.</p><p>The prime minister wants Britain's security council to examine the viability of creating safe havens, an idea championed by Turkey, and to assess whether Assad could be persuaded to stand down by the offer of safe passage to a third country.</p><p>Officials acknowledge that it would be difficult to secure such havens without imposing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria. This is deemed impossible because China and Russia would block such a move, which would be difficult to enforce in the face of Syria's powerful air force.</p><p>But Cameron said he was determined to act across a range of fronts. &quot;That means more help for the opposition, more pressure at the UN, more help for the refugees, more work with the neighbours but also a general sort of: 'Look let's be frank what we've done for the last 18 months hasn't been enough.' The slaughter continues, the bloodshed is appalling, the bad effects it's having on the region, the radicalisation but also the humanitarian crisis that is engulfing Syria. So let's work together on really pushing what more we can do, what other steps we can take to hasten the end of this regime.&quot;</p><p>The No 10 source said: &quot;Today is the moment the prime minister came and saw for himself what is happening. This is the moment to get some impetus going forward. We want to put everything on the table.&quot;</p><p>The main Syrian opposition group, the Syrian National Council, discussed electing a new leader and executive committee on Wednesday. It and other groups will meet on Thursday to form a new 50-member civilian group that will later choose a temporary government for Syria and, western governments hope, improve coordination with armed groups.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/398999525|2013-07-02T12:59:52Z|485846960c3b126c3fe1cb3943e9b5ebfb24b6ad -->",

        "headline":"Israel fires warning shots into Syria as violence escalates in Gaza",
        "body":"<p>Israeli troops are engaged on two of the country's borders, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/13/israel-syria-golan-heights-video\">firing warning shots into Syria</a> after a mortar shell hit an Israeli army post on the Golan Heights and targeting militants in Gaza in an escalating round of violence over the weekend. Four Palestinian civilians were reported killed in air strikes on Gaza.</p><p>In the north, the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) response came amid concerns that the civil war in Syria could spill across the boundary into the Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied since 1967. In the past week, four shells fired from within Syria have landed in the Golan, although none have caused damage or injuries. Eight days ago, three Syrian tanks briefly entered the buffer zone between Syria and the Golan Heights.</p><p>Sunday's warning shots were the first time the IDF has fired into Syrian territory since the 1973 Yom Kippur war. \"A mortar shell targeted an IDF post in the Golan Heights,\" said the army spokeswoman, Avital Leibovich. \"We answered with a warning shot towards Syrian areas. We understand this was a mistake and was not meant to target Israel and then that is why we fired a warning shot in retaliation.\"</p><p>The Israeli military lodged a complaint through United Nations forces operating in the area, stating that \"fire emanating from Syria into Israel will not be tolerated and shall be responded to with severity\".</p><p>The prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday that Israel was \"closely monitoring what is happening on our border with Syria and we are ready for any development\".</p><figure><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/11/11/1352654931535/Israel-borders-WEB-001.png' alt='Israel borders WEB' width='460' height='352' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Another army spokesman, Yoav Mordechai, said Israeli forces had targeted a mortar squad operating near the Syrian army position that had apparently fired the mortar into the Golan, and that the IDF estimated there were no casualties on the Syrian side. \"We have no interest in getting in between the rebels and the Syrian army, but to defend the Golan Heights from stray fire,\" he told the Times of Israel.</p><p>In the south, dozens of rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza between Saturday evening and midday on Sunday by militants from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other organisations. Six Palestinians, including four civilians, were reported killed in at least nine separate Israeli air strikes.</p><p>Netanyahu warned that the military was ready to intensify its response to rocket fire from Gaza following the escalation of attacks and counter-attacks.</p><p>The round of violence followed a similar spike almost three weeks ago, which subsided after intervention by Egyptian mediators. But some observers believe Netanyahu may be more inclined to order a robust approach in the runup to Israel's general election on 22 January.</p><p>Militants in Gaza were \"sustaining harsh hits\" from the IDF, Netanyahu told ministers at Sunday's cabinet meeting. \"The world needs to understand that Israel will not sit with its hands tied in the face of attempts to harm us. We are prepared to intensify our response.\"</p><p>Operation Cast Lead, the three-week assault on Gaza in which about 1,400 Palestinians were killed, was launched in the build-up to Israel's last election in 2009.</p><p>Moshe Ya'alon, minister of strategic affairs, reinforced Netanyahu's warning. \"We aren't going to let this stand … We have many means for exacting a price from the other side, and we will deploy them as we see fit, so that in the end we can bring quiet back to the south,\" he told army radio.</p><p>Asked about the possibility of a ground operation, Ya'alon said: \"Everything is being weighed and will be weighed.\" However, he indicated such a move would only be authorised if targeted air strikes failed to stop rocket fire.</p><p>The increase in violence followed the death on Thursday of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy during an incursion by tanks near the city of Khan Yunis. Hamid Younis Abu Daqqa had been playing football with friends when shots were fired from an Israeli helicopter, according to his father.</p><p>Later, an Israeli soldier was slightly injured when a booby-trapped tunnel dug by militants from Gaza towards Israel exploded.</p><p>On Saturday, militants fired an anti-tank missile from Gaza which wounded four Israeli soldiers on a jeep patrol along the border.</p><p>Six Palestinian factions, including Hamas, the ruling party in Gaza, issued a joint statement saying they were responsible for the rocket fire. Since Operation Cast Lead, Hamas has largely tried to restrain other militant groups from launching rockets and mortars, but it has increasingly participated in military operations over the past few weeks.</p><p>The organisation is under pressure from more radical groups within Gaza, which may explain its unusually open participation in recent violence.</p><p>Israel is concerned that large quantities of weapons from Libya are being smuggled into Gaza from Egypt. Last month an anti-aircraft missile was fired from Gaza for the first time at an Israeli military helicopter, according to Israeli defence officials. The shoulder-fired Strela missile missed its target.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399194867|2013-07-02T12:59:52Z|1e6e2ce12cd8c7f216bca0b1dc72089418f7b852 -->",

        "body":"<p>When revolution first came to Syria, Loubna Mrie decided she would break new ground to help it succeed.</p><p>Deeply affected by the images of dead protesters across the country, the 21-year-old Alawite – the daughter of a leader of the regime's thuggish Shabiha militia and member of Syria's most privileged minority – left her home in the regime heartland of Latakia and travelled to parts of Syria where death tolls were mounting.</p><p>She soon became a feature at demonstrations and even ventured near the frontlines of the regime's fight with an armed opposition, delivering medicines to wounded rebels and finding homes for fleeing families.</p><p>In August, Mrie appeared in a web video, her face wrapped in the independence flag adopted by the opposition. She was injured at a demonstration in which nine fellow protesters were killed. Every step she took to support those fighting four decades of state control earned the increasing wrath of close relatives. Every move made her more vulnerable.</p><p>Last week the revolution took a toll that not even 19 months of exile and enmity had prepared her for. \"I learned that my mother is dead,\" she said. \"And it was my father that killed her.\"</p><p>Alone in a house in Turkey, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/11/syrian-exile-mother\" title=\"\">Mrie now feels racked with guilt</a>. \"My mother was kidnapped immediately after I made the video with the rebels on August 11,\" she said. \"I waited for 10 days. I begged my father to tell me what he knew about it, to let me know. He used to curse me and hang up the phone. Some of my dad's friends told me that she was dead.</p><p>\"Last Friday [2 November] one of my friends, someone that I trust, told me that the dead body had been seen. I called [my father] and told him that he killed her. He said OK. He told me that he wished he could do the same to me.\"</p><p>The Guardian was unable to independently verify Mrie's claim that her mother had been killed.</p><p>Mrie has been told to stay well away from her home village of Jableh and cannot verify for herself that her mother is dead. But she needs no more convincing. \"People I trust are telling me that she's gone,\" she said.</p><p>Early last week, she posted on Facebook a lament to her late mother and to the father that she believes has killed her. The post has drawn widespread sympathy among opposition circles, where Alawite supporters are extremely rare and almost always silent.</p><p>\"They hit her because of me. Was it by electricity or a single bullet in her head?\" the post asked. \"Was she upset at me when they were humiliating her? Did her old age stop them from hurting her?</p><p>\"Abu Muntazer [her father] went to his brothers, cheered them up and told them that he washed the shame that his daughter brought to Jebel al-Akrud [the mountains near Latakia where the video was filmed] ...</p><p>\"I hate my identity and my passport. I hate your name which will accompany mine. What should I say to my future kids about why I don't have a family? Why isn't there a grave for my mum? Why this double punishment? Why the injustice?\"</p><figure><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/11/11/1352659375540/Loubna-Mrie-010.jpg' alt='Loubna Mrie' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Loubna Mrie fears that the Alawites have been co-opted by a regime that wants to retain power by instilling fear in them. Photograph: Ben Solomon</figcaption></figure><p>Yet even in the face of grief that seems impossible to fathom and guilt that has at times been overwhelming, Mrie retains a streak of defiance. She has continued her work in a small unit that acts as a clearing house for mobile phone videos smuggled out of Syria.</p><p>The sense of necessary sacrifice that led her to join the opposition in the early days continues to drive both Mrie and a small number of other Alawite members of the opposition, who fear that their sect has been co-opted by a regime that wants to retain power by instilling fear in them.</p><p>\"On the first day of the revolution, I cried like it was one of my family members. And from that day I decided that we can not go on like that. My people are not really living. The government does not respect us. The mukhabarat [secret police] has taken over our lives. We can't open our mouths.\"</p><p>Latakia is a particularly pro-regime area. The Assad regime draws much of its support from communities there, which have long been prime recruitment grounds for Shabiha members. The Shabiha is a loyalist militia that fiercely defends regime interests and has been in the vanguard of the regime crackdown.</p><p>\"All the Shabiha in Jableh were boys I had grown up with. At the time they were trying to convince me that this was a war against us as minorities and that we had to stop talking to the Sunnis.\"</p><p>Syria's Sunni majority dominates the opposition. The regime is supported by most of the Alawite sect, who make up the vast majority of Syria's military leadership and establishment but only account for around 12% of the population.</p><p>Alawites have loose links to Shia Islam, a fact that inspires some extremist groups on the fringes of the opposition to frame the revolution as an existential battle along the ancient faultline between Shias and Sunnis.</p><p>A majority of Christians also appear to support the regime, along with a sizeable number of the Sunni population, including much of the merchant class, as well as senior military and Ba'ath party officials.</p><p>\"I started to go to the houses of the dead people,\" Mrie said. \" At the time there was a huge gap between them and the Alawites. Both were convinced that each side was fighting the other.</p><p>\"For six months I tried my best to raise awareness that this revolution is not against us. We were fighting for dignity and democracy.</p><p>\"In January I went to Hama and spoke in the name of my sect. I wanted to tell them that my blood is theirs. My father used to tell me that I was a criminal and that he was ashamed of me and that he didn't see me as his daughter.</p><p>\"The stupid thing about this government is its claim that it is trying to protect the people, that it is protecting the Alawites. [Assad] doesn't care if you are Alawite, Christian or Shia. If you are against him, he will kill you.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399202603|2013-07-02T12:59:52Z|78a70c7f03addfb710516c5c29fd06e56ddea12d -->",

        "headline":"Moaz al-Khatib: ex-imam charged with uniting Syria's opposition",
        "body":"<p>When the Syria donors' conference begins on Friday in London, all eyes will turn to Moaz al-Khatib, the new leader of Syria's opposition. A religious moderate, with impeccable revolutionary credentials, and a geologist as well, the west will be looking to see whether Khatib is a man they can do business with.</p><p>Khatib was elected on Sunday in Doha as the head of Syria's new opposition coalition, emerging from negotiations many had predicted were doomed to failure.</p><p>He now has the unenviable task of trying to unite the country's feuding anti-Assad opposition at a time when the west is reluctant to give military aid to the rebels, jihadi groups are increasingly prevalent, and the war on the ground is a bloody and murderous stalemate.</p><p>Khatib's official title is president of the Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces. His key challenge is to turn this unwieldy new group into a force that enjoys credibility inside Syria and with the west, and which could eventually turn into a government-in-waiting.</p><p>The US and the Arab League lost patience with the coalition's predecessor, the Syrian National Council (SNC), which they viewed as ineffective, woefully out of touch and unrepresentative.</p><p>Khatib is the former imam of the Ummayyad mosque in central Damascus. He fled Syria just a few months ago, in July, after several periods of imprisonment. This, and the fact that he has lived in Syria until very recently, gives him a legitimacy that other members of the SNC, many of them long-term exiles, lacked.</p><p>Khatib originally studied geophysics. He spent six years working as an engineer. He is also a member of the Syrian Geological Society and the Syrian Society for Psychological Science, and was president of the Islamic Society of Urbanisation. His status as the former imam makes him a key figure in Syria's religious establishment.</p><p>The Syrian journalist and writer Rana Kabbani, who first met Khatib 20 years ago, says: \"Over the years, we have had a very intense political conversation about what needed to be done in Syria, long discussions about what was wrong with the society and what could be done about it. He was my window into Syria at a time when I couldn't physically go there.\"</p><p>Kabbani added: \"He comes from an area in the old city of Damascus, a part of the city that was noted for its advocacy against French colonialists, producing freedom fighters. It was a traditional Damascene Muslim scene, a devout Sunni area with a long history of resistance.</p><p>\"He cared very deeply about the victims of the 1982 massacre [in the Syrian city of Hama]. He was always seeking for ways to house or educate those [survivors] that the state wanted killed or banished.\"</p><p>But it is Khatib's reputation as a moderate that is his most important attribute, at a time when extreme Islamist groups funded by outside powers are trying to hijack Syria's revolution. Since the uprising began, 20 months ago, Assad has played the sectarian card: telling his own Shia Alawite sect that their fortunes are inextricably bound up with the regime's survival. Without him, Assad has suggested, Alawites face the prospect of being massacred; many, though not all, Alawites believe the president.</p><p>In a speech in September, Khatib set out his own inclusive vision of a tolerant Syria in which the country's various confessions and ethnicities  – Christian, Alawite and Kurd among them – would be respected.</p><p>The Christians had added a \"distinctly civilised touch\", he said, while Syrians also \"felt the pains of the great Kurdish people\". He reportedly added: \"It is paramount to appreciate the characteristics of the Syrian people: Syrians are tolerant, devout and open to everyone. By nature, they reject extremism and injustice.\"</p><p>According to Khatib, the uprising against Assad began last year when the \"arrogant\" regime used brutal force to suppress anti-government demonstrators calling for peaceful change. This is  the dominant view among opposition Syrians. \"Syrians were compelled to take up arms in order to defend their religion, families and properties,\" he said. \"The Syrian revolution is not a violent one. Syrian revolutionaries are peaceful.\"</p><p>Khatib was also outspoken about the \"media smearing\" of the Syrian rebel movement, both by the Syrian government and by some in the west. It was inaccurate to portray the opposition as a \"hotbed of Islamic extremism, terrorism and fundamentalism\", he argued.</p><p>Khatib also said he was not averse to negotiating with Assad. He added that political dialogue didn't mean \"surrendering to the regime's cruelty\" but was the pragmatic \"lesser of two evils\".</p><p>Julien Barnes-Dacey, a senior policy fellow on the Middle East at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Khatib now had a difficult job ahead of him. \"His biggest challenge is to unify the different Syrian groups under his leadership. The divisions haven't gone away. They've been swept under the carpet,\" he said, adding: \"Khatib has come out quite recently. That gives him credibility. He also isn't seen as someone who has political ambitions of his own; he is keen to serve Syria.\"</p><p>According to Barnes-Dacey, Khatib's two new vice-presidents were also well-regarded figures: Riad Seif, a longtime activist, led the successful US-backed initiative to start a new Syrian opposition coalition; Suhair Atassi is a prominent female activist who established an important opposition debating salon after Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father, amid hopes he might turn into a reformist.</p><p>Khatib makes his official debut as Syria's opposition leader at an Arab League-EU conference in Cairo this week. The conference is expected to consider offering the new organisation the vacant membership position left when Syria was suspended as a member state. The effect of that would be to recognise Khatib and the new body as a legitimate representative of all Syrians.</p><p>• This article was amended on 14 November 2012.

        "headline":"David Cameron starts to force the pace on Syria conflict",
        "body":"<p>In the space of a week, Britain has flagged talks with Syria's armed rebels, renewed an offer of exile to Bashar al-Assad, embraced a new opposition body and convened a donor conference to help oust the regime. The pace of the moves and what they potentially represent has left many in government, and indeed in Europe, stunned. For the first time in almost 20 months a real clamour has started about a potential intervention in a conflict that had been too delicate and dangerous for any country to confront.</p><p>The new British posture on Syria was announced by David Cameron an hour after Barack Obama claimed victory in the US election. It has strengthened ever since, every step personally backed by the prime minister, who government officials say has become fed up with the endless slaughter and intransigence and is now willing to do something about it.</p><p>Britain's new stance on Syria is well ahead of its allies in Europe, or across the Atlantic, with the exception of France. It is also increasingly at odds with Damascus's key European backer, Russia, which shows no sign of watering down its resolute support for its Soviet-era ally.</p><p>Both Downing Street and Whitehall know the risks of being well out in front on Syria. Attempts to build meaningful diplomatic alliances have so far led to nothing more than condemnations and sanctions.</p><p>While seething at the death toll in Syria's Sunni-led insurrection and sending funds to fighting groups, the Gulf states – all led by Sunni regimes – have insisted that the US, or another western power, take public charge of dealing with Assad. None had been willing, especially without UN security council backing.</p><p>Last week, a key US official, the former ambassador to Damascus Robert Ford, now a senior player in the White House national security council, said a re-elected Obama was unlikely to change his opposition to a US role. A no-fly zone, a key hope of Syrian rebel groups, would continue to remain off the table.</p><p>If Assad's friends and foes agree on one thing, it is the grave risk of miscalculating in Syria – a state created along several of the region's main geopolitical fault lines and secured by alliances with key western protagonists. But something in Cameron's risk calculus appears to have changed. His advisers suggest he lost patience with daily reports of death and depravity and with an international response that has offered few solutions.</p><p>European officials, meanwhile, do not know what to make of Britain's stance. While broadly supporting the Syrian opposition, key European powers remain stymied by Russia and China and deeply wary of the combustible Middle East igniting if or when Assad falls.</p><p>With so much at stake and with enmity between both sides so entrenched, a seamless transition of power seems next to impossible. Missteps could lead the Levant towards a Balkanisation along ethnic sectarian lines – a nightmare scenario with widespread ramifications elsewhere in the region.</p><p>Nevertheless, an opposition momentum, so elusive since the now stalled armed push into Aleppo and Damascus in July, has clearly energised a reluctant west. The ink on the hard-fought deal to form what is in effect an alternative government in waiting had barely dried before Britain, Turkey and Qatar, among others, were rushing to endorse it.</p><p>The arrival of Sunni Arab donors in London later this week will mark potentially the most decisive phase yet in the campaign against Assad. With a new, more representative body now in place, Britain no longer seems shy about what the cash that the conference will surely attract will end up being used for.</p><p></p><p>Weapons no longer seems to be a dirty word in government circles. Rebels who had complained that binoculars and satellite phones, which Britain promised over the summer, were not helping them win seem to sense that their time may have arrived.</p><p>Just what the British support will end up entailing is still being thrashed out, primarily in Downing Street and Whitehall. British officials in the region had complained over the summer that the government response to the Syrian crisis was around three months out of synch with events on the ground.</p><p>That lost ground is now rapidly being reclaimed. Whether Cameron has the will to directly involve Britain in the conflict is something he seems yet to decide. While he does, Damascus, for the first time in many months, has reason to calibrate its actions. \"It was obvious that he was acting without fear or restraint in recent months,\" one Western official said of Assad in Beirut last week. \"That position is not sustainable.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399275075|2013-07-02T12:59:52Z|5fcfa7d93dfa4ac0cf616e6b37a03a582d6f2713 -->",

        "body":"<p>Israeli forces have fired into Syria for the second day in a row  after a mortar shell landed close to an army post in the Golan Heights, amid fears that Israel could become sucked into the conflict across the border.</p><p>The Israeli military confirmed that tank shells fired by its troops in response to the mortar had made a direct hit. According to military sources, a Syrian mobile artillery battery was the target.</p><p>An Israeli government official hinted that the Damascus regime could be deliberately targeting the Golan. \"Up until yesterday, our assessment was that ordnance that had fallen in Israel was a spillover from the internal conflict inside Syria. Our assessment has changed in the past 24 hours,\" the official told the Guardian.</p><p>On Sunday, the Israel Defence Forces fired across the ceasefire line between Syria and the Golan Heights – which Israel has occupied since 1967 – for the first time since the Yom Kippur war almost 40 years ago.</p><p>Israel has filed complaints with the United Nations, whose forces patrol the demilitarised zone between Syria and the Golan, and warned that cross-border fire \"will be responded to with severity\".</p><p>Mortars from Syria have landed in the Golan five times in the past week. There has also been some cross-border gunfire, and three Syrian army tanks briefly entered the demilitarised zone last weekend.</p><p>Some Israeli observers fear that Syria's beleaguered president, Bashar al-Assad, may seek a confrontation with Israel as a way of rallying support for the regime after more than 18 months of civil war.</p><p>Israel's military chief, Benny Gantz, warned a week ago that the \"Syrian issue … could become our issue.\"</p><p>On Sunday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called for restraint from both Israel and Syria. \"The secretary general is deeply concerned by the potential for escalation. He calls for the utmost restraint and urges Syria and Israel to uphold the disengagement agreement, respect their mutual obligations, and halt firing of any kind across the ceasefire line,\" said a statement issued by his office.</p><p>Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 six-day war, and later annexed it. Although the two countries are still technically at war, the area has been relatively quiet. However, the Syrian government has demanded the return of the Golan as part of any peace agreement with Israel. About 20,000 Druze villagers living in the Golan identify strongly with Syria and there are close family links across the buffer zone.</p><p>The Israeli government has been reluctant to comment publicly on the civil war in Syria but it is deeply concerned about instability in the region. It says Islamic jihadists are increasingly operating in Syria, the Egyptian Sinai and Gaza.</p><p>Meanwhile, rockets continued to be fired from Gaza into southern Israel despite Egyptian efforts to broker a ceasefire after a weekend of escalating violence.</p><p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, told a gathering of 50 ambassadors in Ashkelon, a city close to the Hamas-governed territory, that Israel had \"the right and obligation to defend its citizens\".</p><p>Amid speculation that Israel may be preparing a ground operation inside Gaza to halt rocket fire, Netanyahu said: \"We will not sit idly in front of recurrent attacks that occur almost daily, against our citizens and our children … None of your governments would accept such a situation. We do not accept such a situation, and I as prime minister of Israel am not prepared to accept this situation, and we will act to stop it.\"</p><p>More than 20 people were treated for shock after a rocket hit a house in Netivot on Monday morning. Six Palestinians, including four civilians, were killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza over the weekend.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399259627|2013-07-02T12:59:52Z|c62f49f8b8b8c7b1d16c60d5bfa3248eb453fd65 -->",

        "body":"<p>Qatar and Turkey, two of the Syrian opposition's biggest international backers, have called for other states to endorse an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/12/syria-opposition-unity-coaltion-video\">umbrella deal signed on Sunday</a> night that unites feuding anti-Assad groups and paves a way for funding to resume.</p><p>The formation of the group had been a key demand of the US and the Gulf states, which have sidelined the original political body, the Syrian National Council, and urged that a broader and more representative group be established.</p><p>After a week of wrangling in the Qatari capital, Doha, the chance of such a group being enshrined had nearly evaporated. However, an agreement was finally reached that absorbed the SNC and nominated a new leadership.</p><p>A former imam at the Umayyad mosque in the Syrian capital, Damascus, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, was named leader. Riad Seif, who proposed the new initiative, and Suhair Atassi, a female activist, will be his deputies.</p><p>Qatar, which had invested much regional capital in an accord being struck on its soil, said the international community no longer had an excuse to ignore the Syrian opposition. Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, adopted a similar tone. Qatar later called for the new body to be considered the only legitimate representative of the Syrian people.</p><p>\"Trust us that we will strive from now on to have this new body recognised completely by all parties … as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people,\" said Qatar's prime minister, Hamid bin Jassem.</p><p>The SNC, which has been lambasted as nepotistic exiles detached from realities inside Syria, will no longer be the dominant voice in the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. The new group – the Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces – will attempt to represent political, military and civil groups under a united banner.</p><p>The SNC remained reluctant to the end to lend its weight to the agreement, but faced a prosect of being sidelined altogether. It had already lost the confidence of the US and Arab League members as the Syrian civil war steadily worsened.</p><p>The new group is understood to be waiting for the recognition of the broader international community before announcing a provisional government.</p><p>Military leaders inside Syria and civilian leaders in exile are still unlikely to gain support for their call for the establishment of a no-fly zone over parts, or all, of Syria. The US has been reluctant to support such a move and Robert Ford, a senior administration official and former ambassador to Damascus, said Barack Obama was unlikely to drop his opposition during his second term as president.</p><p>Russia and China, which have blocked previous moves against the Assad regime at the United Nations security council, appear unlikely to change their stances.</p><p>Observers in Doha cautioned that the hard won agreement could still encounter trouble. Some Arab officials familiar with fraught opposition diplomacy say the SNC started with wide consensus and promise but later proved it could not deliver.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/399213660|2013-07-02T12:59:52Z|517fb1e0905e0d885a422873d438299e2cb11e2f -->",

He is representative of a mosque [The Umayyad in Damascus] and a city which were themselves very layered.

It is difficult to look at the new coalition body and say the opposition is still not united …</p><p>The international community had a problem that they were trying to solve. They were trying to figure out a way to have a unified mechanism to get support to Syria. The SNC was an umbrella organisation yet there were some opposition parties that were outside of it.</p><p>The international community put some pressure on us to really try and take a leadership role in bringing more of the opposition parties into this coalition. After two or three days of negotiations we came to terms and everybody I think is happy with the result.</p></blockquote><p>Saleh said the the new coalition includes representatives from the joint military council that controls about 80% of the rebel forces in Syria.

        "headline":"Syrian opposition says west has promised military aid",
        "body":"<p>The Syrian opposition says it has been promised western military support in return for forming a united front, in advance of a donors' conference in London on Friday intended to consolidate the new rebel coalition.</p><p>British diplomats said Friday's expert-level meeting would discuss purely non-lethal aid to the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, formed on Sunday in Doha, but neither the UK nor French governments are ruling out arming the opposition in the coming months in an attempt to break the bloody deadlock in Syria.</p><p>The conflict showed more signs of spreading  as Israeli tanks fired at Syrian positions for the second time in as many days in response to Syria mortar fire landing on the Israeli-held Golan Heights, and a Syrian government jet <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/13/syrian-border-town-air-raids-video\">bombed a rebel-held village</a> just yards from the Turkish border.</p><p>Turkey has raised the possibility of asking Nato to deploy Patriot anti-aircraft missiles along its southern border. It has  yet to put a formal request to the alliance, but Turkish officials said the latest bombing showed it was necessary for it to strengthen the defences on its southern flank. Turkey, which has about 120,000 Syrian refugees on its territory, is also pushing for expanding western backing for the rebels.</p><p>The new National Coalition, which claims to represent 90% of Syrian opposition groups, including the various rebel armed forces inside the country, won recognition from Gulf states  night but looked likely to win only observer status at Tuesday's Arab League meeting in Cairo.</p><p>It hopes to be recognised as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people by western nations at a meeting of the Friends of Syria in Marrakech next month.</p><p>\"The international community realises the situation in Syria is unsustainable and that its own self-interest is at stake as it destabilises the region,\" said Yaser Tabbara, a coalition spokesman. \"We have assuaged a lot of the concerns and fulfilled a lot of preconditions on the Syrian armed opposition in terms of accountability and unity, and I believe the international community is ready to invest in the opposition both militarily and politically. That is the sense we got in Doha.\"</p><p>Tabbara said the coalition would be asking for \"the types of weapons with which we can enforce our own no-fly zones\", a reference to portable anti-aircraft missiles which the rebels have long been seeking. Western officials have had deep misgivings about providing such missiles in case they ended up in terrorist hands and used against civilian airliners, but they are increasingly alarmed about the destabilising consequences of non-intervention. Qatar and Saudia Arabia have provided most of the rebels' arms supplies, but those weapons have gone disproportionately to extremist Salafist and jihadist groups, who have been increasingly prominent in Aleppo and other fronts in the civil war.</p><p>Britain and the US are reviewing their policy of restricting their assistance to non-military equipment. Prime minister David Cameron is frustrated with the military impasse and the rising death toll, so the British government has announced it is opening talks with rebel commanders. The French military are believed to be making contingency plans for supplying weapons. Welcoming the formation of the National Coalition, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, made a pointed reference to the prospect of arming the opposition.</p><p>\"France – who recognizes the Syrian people's right to defend themselves against the attacks of the criminal regime in Damascus – very much hopes this coalition can be quickly consolidated, enjoying the broadest possible support from Syrians and the international community,\" Fabius said.</p><p>Western officials have been urging the coalition leadership to act fast to turn the Doha agreement into an functioning alternative administration, to speed international recognition and arms supplies. \"We are not entirely there,\" a European diplomat said.</p><p>Syrian opposition leaders say, in return, they can only establish the necessary structures once they receive more western backing.</p><p>\"We keep hearing about this concept of sequencing,\"</p><p>Tabbara said. \"But we are in a Catch 22. We are told we will get the serious support once we have operational structures in place but we in the middle  know things are more complex. In order to build a government with full authority inside the country, we need support and political recognition. We are trying to balance this Catch 22 as delicately as we can, and try to move in parallel with the demands of the international community.\"</p><p>Syria is likely to figure in the EU summit next month, but so far no member state has put the existing EU arms embargo on the agenda. Revising or lifting it would require the unanimous agreement of all 27 member states. British lawyers are looking at whether the wording of the embargo agreement, allowing a state to supply weapons if it determines it \"is intended solely for humanitarian or protective use\", provides a loophole.</p><p>Western capitals may hope that the credible threat of heightened intervention could be enough to persuade Russia and China to agree to a UN security council resolution putting sanctions on President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>Russia has thus far been adamantly opposed to a punitive UN action against the regime, a close regional ally.
