Gil Martins, an&nbsp;FBI agent specialising in domestic terrorism, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lapsed Catholic confident in his atheism, never mind that it has caused a rift with his devout wife. However, when several enemies of the Christian right – scientists, polemicists, abortionists – die mysteriously, Martins becomes convinced that&nbsp;they have been killed by the power&nbsp;of prayer; that&nbsp;a charismatic Texan preacher whose church his wife attends has found a way to channel prayers so that they summon God's avenging demon Azrael. As fans of his&nbsp;Berlin-set Bernie Gunther novels will know, Kerr is a details man. His deep-level research brings Houston and its environs to dusty, sun-bleached life. Martins' narration, too, is deftly handled – <em>Prayer</em> demands to be read more than&nbsp;once. A shame, then, that the Amityville-style theatrics which, um, bedevil the last act should resemble bad CGI – too weightless and literal to be as scary as Kerr needs them to be.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420038019'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381760091072/The-Kill-List-by-Frederic-001.jpg' alt='The Kill List by Frederick Forsyth' width='120' height='182' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Talking of weightless … Perhaps, if&nbsp;I&nbsp;hadn't read Terry Hayes's <em>I Am Pilgrim</em> so recently, I would have been more kindly disposed towards Frederick Forsyth's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780593071977\" title=\"\"><strong>The Kill List</strong></a> (Bantam, £18.99). Hayes used the template laid down by Forsyth in <em>The&nbsp;Day of the Jackal</em> et al, but upgraded it to reflect the complexities of modern hi‑tech espionage. <em>The Kill List</em>'s hero is US colonel Kit&nbsp;Carson, AKA The Tracker; its villain is The Preacher, an&nbsp;Islamist cleric who delivers his internet lectures in perfect English. Plot: The&nbsp;Tracker hunts down The&nbsp;Preacher, with a bit of last-minute help from Our&nbsp;Boys. Forsyth's style mixes bombast and TV‑movie dialogue (\"I&nbsp;do&nbsp;not want to&nbsp;shoot you, Sheikh. You are not he whom I seek\") with a&nbsp;laundry-list blankness, which may be&nbsp;deliberate but in practice reduces already one-dimensional characters to&nbsp;mere archetypes. Technical detail is plentiful, but much of it rings hollow in&nbsp;the light of Forsyth's self-confessed \"cyber-dumbo\" status: \"The records were fed into the computers which scanned them far faster than the human eye could read or the human brain digest.\" Um, Fred – no offence, but wouldn't the records already have been in the computers?</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420038020'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381760117271/419-by-Will-Ferguson-001.jpg' alt='419 by Will Ferguson' width='120' height='191' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Canadian Will Ferguson is best known in this country for his 2001 satire of the self-help industry <em>Happiness™</em>. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781781855058\" title=\"\"><strong>419</strong></a> (Head of Zeus, £16.99), which won&nbsp;Canada's prestigious Giller prize last year, is very different – an elegant literary thriller about a shy but resourceful copy editor, Laura, who travels to Nigeria to confront the men responsible for her father's death. Henry Curtis killed himself after he was bankrupted in an elaborate 419 scam – the kind that&nbsp;used to begin with an email from a&nbsp;west African prince promising riches if you sent him money first. (419 refers to the section of the Nigerian criminal code that relates to obtaining money or&nbsp;goods under false pretences.) Alongside this revenge plot, Ferguson gives us the stories of three Nigerians whose lives have been blighted by lawlessness and western predation: the&nbsp;scammer himself, Winston, who&nbsp;is&nbsp;in the grip of a&nbsp;terrifying&nbsp;gang boss; pregnant Amina, escaping from her family of cattle herders across the dusty desert; and Nnamdi, a&nbsp;fisherman's son drawn into the black market for petrol. <em>419</em> is immersive, neatly structured, and full of smart dialogue and oblique insights. Yet Henry, a retired schoolteacher from&nbsp;Calgary, never seems like the kind&nbsp;of person who would have fallen for a&nbsp;419, even though the fictional one Ferguson devises is carefully targeted to its victim.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420038021'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381760137315/If-You-Were-Here-by-Alafa-001.jpg' alt='If You Were Here by Alafair Burke' width='120' height='184' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The daughter of crime legend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview14\" title=\"\">James&nbsp;Lee Burke</a>, Alafair Burke has two&nbsp;series of crime procedurals to her&nbsp;name. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571303441\" title=\"\"><strong>If&nbsp;You Were Here</strong></a> (£12.99), her first novel with Faber in the UK, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;likable standalone mystery in the style of Harlen Coben and Linwood Barclay.

        "headline":"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee - review",
        "body":"<p>To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those books that almost everyone reads at some point in their lives. Whether you've been forced to read it at school, or you've had a look because everyone's been urging you to, most people have their own personal experience of reading Mockingbird.</p><p>The book is about Atticus Finch, who appears as an unconventional hero and role model due to his morality rather than his physical capabilities. The theme of morals is apparent throughout the whole novel, especially in relation to religion and perception of sin. Take Mrs Dubose, a recovering morphine addict: she vows that she'll die beholden to nothing and nobody. She's pursuing her own dream of being a free human being because she knows deep down that it's right. </p><p>To Kill a Mockingbird focuses on that gut instinct of right and wrong, and distinguishes it from just following the law. Even the titular quote: \"Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird\" is in itself an allegory for this message. Being in itself a generic message, the idea of 'doing what's right' obviously has a different meaning depending on when and where you're reading the book. If you take 1960, when the book was written, America was in a state of ethical development as social inequality was - very - gradually being overcome. Women's rights and black rights movements were beginning to emerge and some campaigned through violence. Would Atticus Finch condone this?</p><p>In the 1930s, when the book was set, America was in the midst of the Great Depression. This was a time when economic difficulties meant that the American Dream was receding further and further away. We could consider that Atticus Finch felt that his own dream of an equal, morally decent society was also heading in the wrong direction. </p><p>Without denying the constancy of the moral message, and the pure ingenuity of the book, it's still open to debate whether, as with all classics, schoolchildren should be forced to read the novel and go over it page-by-page. The beauty of literature and the reason why I love it so much is that a writer must eventually relinquish the meaning of his or her book. Therefore everyone who reads it can take something out of it which no one has before. I find that a beautiful notion myself, but it seems that looking for these life lessons has become a less and less popular exercise as the years have gone by. Let it not be forgotten that a true piece of literature, like To Kill a Mockingbird, is meaningful in every period and that today, Atticus Finch's message should be heard in the midst of all the global conflicts that we hear of on the news every night.</p><p>To think that children are suffering across the world because of a tyrannical regime or an unfair justice system is a depressing notion, and I think a modern Atticus Finch would agree. I don't think he would be comfortable knowing that innocent lives were suffering because of inequality. Atticus would now be defending issues that Harper Lee did not consider when writing the book, such as gay and lesbian rights, because what is at the heart of his character is an acceptance of who people are. That is a moral standpoint that you can hold whoever you are or wherever you are born. Atticus Finch is not xenophobic or homophobic. He's not racist or sexist. He's human and he sees everyone else in the same way. Who knows? Maybe Atticus Finch would even be an animal rights supporter. </p><p>Should it be analysed, taught in schools and pulled to pieces? I can't say, but what I will say is I'm not against anyone reading for the sake of reading. I've read many a book which I've enjoyed, put down and never thought about since. But I honestly feel that Mockingbird is a book which should be read, be it in school or in adult life (or both), without complete and utter absorption. It's a book with so many layers of meaning that you can get so much out of it. I for one know that To Kill a Mockingbird is a book that really has changed my life and that every time I go back over it, I find something new that I assimilate into my own code of ethics. Going over it, whilst being an arduous task, was in the long run worth all the time it took, and plenty more besides.</p><p>I would really advise picking up a copy of Harper Lee's magnificent novel and giving it a try. Because whatever happens, it will never stop being a good book, and it will never stop inspiring good people.</p><p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419574618|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|1ecbde937480173b0b3f10cbb4b6cb2e31c29915 -->",

        "body":"<p>There's a new kind of comic event coming to our shores, modelled not on the superhero-focused all-American approach, but on a much closer neighbour: the European comic festival. With founder patrons including the Costa prize-winning Mary and Bryan Talbot, the <a href=\"http://www.comicartfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Lakes International comic art festival</a> has an eclectic guest list, from the artist of The Walking Dead, Charlie Adlard, to the graphic journalist Joe Sacco.</p><p>And unlike a fair number of other conventions, which have come under fire in the past few years for only inviting only one or two women guests – if any – this weekend's event taking over the whole of Kendal, Cumbria, aims to include talents old and new from both sides of the gender divide.</p><p>Long-time Guardian favourite and multiple award-winner Posy Simmonds is one such guest, a prolific artist who has been drawing comics since she was a little girl. Her collection last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/mrs-webers-omnibus-posy-simmonds\" title=\"\">Mrs Weber's Omnibus</a>, brought together her <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224096836\" title=\"\">long-running strips for the Guardian</a> about a well-meaning middle-class family.</p><p>\"As a child,\" Simmonds tells me, \"I liked the combination of words and pictures -  in bound copies of Punch magazines and, later, in the piles of comics some American kids used to give me. There was also something subversive about comics that appealed - adults didn't approve of them.\"</p><p>That subversiveness has long been a key component of the medium, and something that has tied comics to women's history throughout the decades. Visiting from the US, the cartoonist <a href=\"http://www.trinarobbins.com/Trina_Robbins/Welcome.html\" title=\"\">Trina Robbins</a> will be discussing her half-century career in comics, from her beginnings as one of the most influential underground comix artists in the 1970s, when she led the feminist charge against the boys' club attitude that prevailed at the time.</p><p>But comics and feminism have been intertwined long before underground comix hit the counterculture scene, as can be seen in the movement covered in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/02/costa-awards-graphic-novel-biography\" title=\"\">Mary Talbot</a>'s second graphic novel, Sally Heathcote: Suffragette (Jonathan Cape, to be published May 2014), illustrated by Edinburgh artist <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-10104994556,00.html\" title=\"\">Kate Charlesworth</a>.</p><p>\"I seem to have arrived at comics accidentally,\" Charlesworth says. \"I've never aspired to art or literature, but  comics are an astonishingly accommodating medium - narrative and visuals creating something bigger than the sum of their parts - like two good collaborators getting together.\"</p><p>The late 19th and early 20th century witnessed the Suffragette struggle on many fronts, and cartoonists did battle in the pages of newspapers. A history of the movement in this very medium is perhaps rather fitting.</p><p>\"Comics can put the drama and humanity back into histories which may have been stripped back to key facts,\" Charlesworth says, \"and also have the space to investigate complex issues, in this case feminism. Both sides in the suffrage debate employed cartoons and comic narratives as powerful propaganda tools.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420243675'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382005675888/mary-and-bryan-talbot-010.jpg' alt='mary and bryan talbot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mary and Brian Talbot, patrons of the Lakes International comic art festival.

The story of her own  struggle with an eating disorder, it's a heavy book, both literally and in subject matter.</p><p>\"Comics is a very accessible medium,\" Green explains. \"You don't need any fancy equipment or a special place to display them, you can start with just a pen and some paper. I'm a very visual person, but I am also a control freak.  When making comics you have ultimate control over every aspect of set and costume design, pacing and storytelling, character and dialogue, while still creating something visual and utterly immersive in a way that the written word isn't.\"</p><p>\"Reading a comic is very intimate,\" she continues, \"and for me that was always a comfort when drawing about such personal stuff: that it would be experienced by one person at a time in the privacy of their own reading. Also the combination of visual language with text gives so many possibilities for expression: there are things words can say that images can't, and likewise things images can say that words can't. But there are also things that can only be said with both words and images working together, a language that is unique to comics.\"</p><p>For others looking to work out their own difficult issues on the page, Green advises: \"If it feels important to tell, tell it. The more we talk about the difficult things, the less difficult they become to talk about.\"</p><p>Relative newcomer Isabel Greenberg has made a big impact in the last couple of years, and the winner of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/observer-graphic-short-story-prize\" title=\"\">Jonathan Cape/Observer/Comica graphic short story prize</a> in 2011 has now released her first graphic novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/14/encyclopedia-early-earth-isabel-greenberg\" title=\"\">The Encyclopedia of Early Earth</a> (Jonathan Cape). Unfortunately she has also experienced one of the major difficulties many comic creators experience in the mainstream press – condescension.  A <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/03/graphic-novelist-isabel-greenberg-dont-put-that-in-it-makes-me-sound-super-nerdy-4132040/\" title=\"\">recent interview</a> described her as a \"petite blonde\", \"princess\", and compared her to Tinkerbell.</p><p>Greenberg hasn't felt sidelined in the UK comics scene itself however, and certainly indie comic fairs have a very even gender split. \"Generations of women have struggled so that I can be so lucky,\" she tells me.</p><p>One such generation of course includes Posy Simmonds and Trina Robbins. Pretty in Ink (Fantagraphics, December), Robbins's most recent \"herstorian\" or feminist history, illustrates the struggles that women artists and cartoonists have faced across the decades. But overall, coverage of comics and women creators has almost certainly improved - not least because the audience is ever expanding, and increasingly diverse.</p><p>\"Graphic novels and comics are getting a bit more attention in the mainstream media,\" says Simmonds. \"Nothing like the attention paid to comics in France and Belgium, say, but a big difference from 20 years ago. I remember telling someone I was writing a graphic serial and they said 'Graphic? Why're you writing filth?'\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicartfestival.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Lakes International Comic Art Festival runs from October 18-20; comicartfestival.com</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420236994|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|638d7db46da4e70a1e76c9ce2651262193ca52b1 -->",

        "body":"<p>At the end of <em>My Brilliant Career</em>, the 1901 novel by Miles Franklin (who was actually Stella Miles Franklin), the heroine who dreamed of becoming a writer is left thwarted and misunderstood, with little prospect of making the life she imagined. Rachel Cooke invokes that sad inheritance in her title, but does not dwell on it. Hers is an exuberant, glass-chinking book about 10 women a couple of generations later who – with phenomenal energy and determination – built the brilliant careers they wanted.</p><p>This is a splendidly various collection of \"brief lives\" written with both gusto&nbsp;and sensitivity. Most readers will&nbsp;know some of the subjects, but not&nbsp;all. There&nbsp;is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alison-smithson-1462016.html\" title=\"\">Alison Smithson</a>, the modernist architect. Margery Fish, gardener and&nbsp;plantswoman. The barrister Rose Heilbron, later a high court judge. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/18/guardianobituaries.food\" title=\"\">Patience Gray</a>, the cookery writer who far out-sold Elizabeth David. The archaeologist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes\" title=\"\">Jacquetta Hawkes, author of that sensuous geological masterpiece <em>A Land</em></a>.</p><p>One chapter is inhabited by three of&nbsp;Cooke's Tremendous 10 (and yes, there is a touch of the hockey-stick in the tone, but the effect is generally invigorating). They lived in a crowded three-way relationship, so it all makes sense: the journalist Nancy Spain, Joan&nbsp;Werner Laurie, founder of She magazine, and Sheila Van Damm, who trained as a formation flying pilot, found there was no place for women in aviation, wondered what to do, and then became a racing driver. Sisters-in-law <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Box\" title=\"\">Muriel Box</a> and Betty Box share a&nbsp;chapter because they were both making their way in the film industry. This is Betty Box who became Betty Box Office after producing the huge hit <em>Doctor in the House</em>. She had insisted on casting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/10/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Dirk Bogarde</a>; nobody else had thought he was much good.</p><p>Box looks sensational in the photos, taking a coffee break with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/katharinehepburn\" title=\"\">Katharine Hepburn</a>, but it's important that Cooke studies directors and producers rather than the on-screen stars. All her subjects are poised between being exceptional individuals and being trailblazers in paths we might aspire to follow. She purposely decided not to write about Celia Johnson and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/31/biography.stage\" title=\"\">Margot Fonteyn</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\" title=\"\">Sylvia Plath</a> was never in contention. So, though we're used to reading about the lives of the great artists, writers and thinkers, this book is not about them. On the other hand, though we're increasingly drawn to what Woolf called \"infinitely obscure lives\" that \"remain to be recorded\", this is not a project of recovery. The idea, appealingly, is to think about women who became well-known for being terrifically good at what they did. They were professional pioneers of the 1950s, respected by their peers and remembered admiringly, perhaps not by millions, but certainly by those working in related fields. They&nbsp;were all career women when that&nbsp;was rare, and today's working women are in their debt.</p><p>I am ashamed that, though I have an office next to the law faculty at the University of Liverpool, I did not know the story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/13/guardianobituaries.gender\" title=\"\">Rose Heilbron</a>, who studied here in the early 1930s. She became the second woman in the country to get a first-class law degree, before going on to take silk in her mid-30s. The court reporters loved the twinkle in her eyes and the angle of her wig, though eventually everyone had to concede that there was a bit more to her than that. When she successfully defended striking dockers in 1951, crowds of Liverpool workers lined the platform at&nbsp;Lime Street to salute her&nbsp;return.</p><p>Heilbron and Smithson stand out as the only representatives of women in \"the professions\" – this is not a book of office jobs. The triumphs of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/nov/30/shopping.gardens\" title=\"\">Margery Fish</a> are in her&nbsp;garden at East Lambrook, where she collected thousands of&nbsp;plant varieties. In housecoat and sturdy shoes, she did not look the ultimate career woman. Nor did Patience Gray, learning to cook in the billiard room bedsit of a Gothic house, and later living \"wild\" in Apulia, \"wizened and witchy-looking\", skinning foxes and harvesting weeds.</p><p>But this is part of Cooke's point. Careers are made from inventiveness, willpower and addiction. Her gardeners and food-writers were no dabbling hobbyists; 12-hour days were standard.</p><p>Some of these women knew from the age of about five exactly what they wanted to do. Their rehearsals for life are admirable and touching. The logistics of reading long past bedtime can be challenging enough, but the future Jacquetta Hawkes needed to practice being an archaeologist. She drew bison&nbsp;on the garden wall to set the prehistoric scene. And then she snuck out at night to conduct excavations in the lawn, labouring into the small hours with torch and trowel.</p><p>Success took time. Muriel Box trained as a typist, lived on sausage rolls from the ABC restaurant, and got a job at a corset factory in Welwyn. At least she was independent: it was a start. There is an affecting story about what Heilbron did when her mother was dying, young, of cancer. Rose was still in training and was yet to be called to the bar, but she went out and hired, illicitly, a wig and gown. She allowed her mother to see, just once, the figure her daughter was on course to become.</p><p>Once each woman is launched, personal and professional lives compete for space on the page. The practical questions matter: what time will she get home at night? Who mowed the lawn? How long is the baby&nbsp;in that Moses basket by the desk going to be asleep? There is usually an unsatisfactory marriage to escape, and Cooke tells some astounding stories of wild passions, secret pregnancies and deceived children.</p><p>These sensations are never quite allowed to steal the show, because the real drama here is in the work. It's true that from the outside hard graft can look a little dull. What Heilbron's university contemporaries remember is that \"she was always working in the library. I don't remember seeing her at any dances.\" This can be troublesome when you're trying to tell a pacey tale; textbooks are not spectacular. Cooke leaves the scholar to her own devices in the library, and catches up with her later when she's standing to give some nicely devastating after-dinner speech. Still, the compromise is understandable. Brief lives rely on abbreviation, and Cooke makes an art of it. This is a book in which people get MBEs for things they do in a sub-clause, and yet somehow we come to feel the long-haul nature of their efforts.</p><p>Resilience and stamina are much in&nbsp;evidence. \"They were as tough as boots,\" Cooke says approvingly of the&nbsp;Boxes: \"They ate setbacks for breakfast.\" But no one who's any good takes things so easily. Later we meet Muriel looking altogether less boot-like, coping with the \"low moods, painful joints, exhaustion, various infections and fevers\" that routinely accompanied the process of making a film. When her subjects do eventually make it to the top, Cooke watches carefully what they do with their success. Are they freer, or happier? Are they impossible with their friends? Betty Box ordered up a floor-length mink coat and adored it, though on set in India she preferred to wear a poncho with secret pockets in which she could hide contraband gin for the crew.</p><p>\"The bliss of work! The balm of it, and the satisfaction.\" Cooke is speaking partly on behalf of her 1950s subjects: this is what, at some point, they all felt. She is also speaking openly and passionately for herself. Yes, work is boring or nerve-racking or sleep-depriving, but the pleasure, too, should be acknowledged and fostered. In a brilliant passage, she reads Alison Smithson's designs for the&nbsp;interior of <a href=\"http://postwarbuildings.com/buildings/the-economist-buildings\" title=\"\">the Economist Buildings</a> as a tribute to the professional lives that would be lived there:</p><p>\"This was again Alison's realm, and&nbsp;included a filing system in the form of&nbsp;glorious Japanese-inspired lacquer boxes. Pillar-box red and silk smooth to the touch … A woman who&nbsp;understood more than most the&nbsp;power and comfort of work, she could have paid the Economist's harried secretaries and journalists no greater compliment than to imbue their daily rituals with beauty, and just&nbsp;a hint of the clandestine.\"</p><p>In a painfully slow job market, many&nbsp;graduates of 2013 will find themselves at temporary desks eating sausage rolls for lunch, trying secretly, stubbornly to keep their ambitions in view. They will think it is a rare privilege to know the \"balm\" of doing what you love, though they will surely agree it is worth aiming for. So let's talk&nbsp;about quotas, let's talk about pay, and let's follow Cooke's lead in remembering to talk about joy.</p><p>• Alexandra Harris's <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudson.com/Virginia_Woolf/9780500290866\" title=\"\"><em>Virginia Woolf</em></a><em> is published by Thames and Hudson.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419928053|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|cbaf80366cc5d8a1d55e98bc0772a766a9615600 -->",

        "headline":"The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt – review",
        "body":"<p>It is dangerous to write openings as compelling as Donna Tartt's. In <em>The Secret History</em>, the one-page prologue gives us a murder and a narrator who has helped to commit it. <em>The Little Friend</em> starts with the death of a child who, by page 15, is found hanging by a&nbsp;piece of rope from a tree branch, his red hair \"the only thing about him that&nbsp;was the right colour any more\". And now, in <em>The Goldfinch</em>, Tartt has a 50‑page two-part opening. In the first section, the narrator, Theo Decker, is&nbsp;holed up in an Amsterdam hotel, looking at newspapers written in Dutch, which he can't understand; he&nbsp;is searching for his name in articles illustrated with pictures of police cars and crime scene tapes. Before any of this is explained, the story moves back 14&nbsp;years to the day Theo's mother dies, when he is on the cusp of adolescence. Her death takes place in New York's Metropolitan Museum, as a consequence of an exploding bomb – mother and son are in separate rooms when the bomb blast occurs, and the descriptions of Theo regaining consciousness in the wreckage, and trying to find his way out of the ripped-apart museum before returning home, expecting to find his mother there, are&nbsp;written in astonishingly gripping prose. This is, of course, where the danger comes in: if, at the end of the kind of set piece to which the word \"climactic\" should emphatically apply, you still have 700 pages to go, aren't you setting your readers up for disappointment?</p><p>Astonishingly, the answer is no. The novel changes gear and, for a while, is primarily involved with showing us, affectingly, the dislocation of Theo's life – a dislocation both emotional and physical. His mother dead, his father long absent, he finds himself living with the Barbours, the family of a&nbsp;school friend; this is understood by everyone to be a short-term option, and the cold spectre of unknown and unloving grandparents who will eventually become Theo's guardians hovers over the novel for a time until his father reappears, with his girlfriend Xandra, and takes Theo off to live with him in Las Vegas. There will be more twists and turns in this tale of a&nbsp;motherless boy whose life involves dramatic changes and is peopled with a&nbsp;vast cast of characters, many of whose affections and intentions it isn't&nbsp;easy to work out. If there's any one novel this strand of the story calls to mind, it's<em> Great Expectations</em> – there's even a character called Pippa, perhaps a playful melding of Pip and Estella. Pippa, near Theo in age, was also in the&nbsp;museum when the bomb exploded, and is the only person who Theo feels can understand his heart.</p><p>But there is a second strand to the novel, this one with echoes of <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. Young Theo Decker enters a museum with his mother; he&nbsp;leaves with a painting. The painting – one that actually exists in the world – is <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/html_m/f/fabritiu/carel/goldfinc.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Goldfinch</em> by Carel Fabritius</a>, a&nbsp;student of Rembrandt's, who died at&nbsp;the age of 32 when a gunpowder factory near his studio exploded. Almost all his work was destroyed; <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> is widely considered the finest of the paintings that survived. \"Anything we manage to save from history is a miracle,\" Theo's mother says to him, minutes before her death – an idea that runs deep in the veins of&nbsp;the novel. Picking up the painting from the debris and walking out of the museum with it isn't exactly theft, not if theft involves the conscious decision to steal. Theo is acting in a state of mental distress, on the instructions of&nbsp;a dying man who tells him to take the painting. This man, it so happens, is guardian to Pippa – at this point, she&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing more to Theo than an arresting-looking girl, all too briefly glimpsed, though, later, their lives will collide and separate, repeatedly.</p><p>But once Theo reads in the newspaper that the painting is believed to have been destroyed in the explosion, he chooses to keep quiet about his possession of it – and from here on, he&nbsp;is culpable. As the years go on, both Theo's attachment to the painting (a&nbsp;thing of beauty, but also a physical connection to one of the last conversations he had with his mother) and his guilt over his continued possession of such a priceless work of art grows. So, too, does his fear of being imprisoned for stealing the object. It should come as no surprise, in a novel that opens with crime scene tapes and exploding museums, that the story of Theo and the painting is a story of betrayal, suspicion, double-dealing and shoot-outs. Raymond Chandler is no less a&nbsp;presence here than Dickens and Dostoyevsky. To say any more about the events of the novel would be to deprive a reader of the great joy of being swept up by the plot. If anyone has lost their love of storytelling, <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> should most certainly return it to them.</p><p>The novel isn't, of course, all action and suspense. Some of its most memorable moments occur in stillness. Take Theo's first experience of the desert skies of Las&nbsp;Vegas, after a life spent amid the light pollution of New York. Until now, he has only known the constellations as \"childhood patterns that had twinkled me to sleep from the glow-in‑the-dark planetarium stars on my bedroom ceiling back in New York. Now, transfigured – cold and glorious like deities with their disguises flung off – it was as if they'd flown through the roof and into the sky to assume their true, celestial homes.\" It is a&nbsp;glorious piece of prose, but placed within a novel about a boy who has lost his true home – which is, wherever his mother might be – it becomes heart-piercing, too. Tartt may already have displayed her great gift for plot in her debut, but the emotional register of <em>The Goldfinch</em> is of a different order from either of her previous works.</p><p>It would be wrong, however, to think that all the emotions are centred around loss. At the heart of the novel is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evocation of boyhood friendship – that of Theo and Boris, the&nbsp;Ukrainian outsider he meets on his first day of&nbsp;school in Las Vegas. Boris is an unforgettable creation – a thieving, drinking, drug-taking teenager who lights up each page he is on, even as he&nbsp;leads Theo into a world of excess. Their relationship works so well on the&nbsp;page in part because it has been prefigured by Theo's friendship, in New&nbsp;York, with a boy called Tom Cable – a friendship with a \"wild, manic quality, something unhinged and hectic and a little perilous about it\". Tartt doesn't present Theo as&nbsp;someone who comes unmoored from his own character by the death of his mother, but, more convincingly, as a&nbsp;boy whose&nbsp;flaws become more deeply inscribed in him as a consequence of&nbsp;loss. Then again, it&nbsp;is not entirely right to think of Theo's friendship with Boris&nbsp;as a flaw – the love between the boys is both simple and complicated, in the way of the best friendships. And&nbsp;when Boris re-enters Theo's life in adulthood it is impossible not to hope he is there as a friend, even while fearing the opposite.</p><p>Plot and character and fine prose can&nbsp;take you far – but a novel this good makes you want to go even further. The last few pages of the novel take all&nbsp;the serious, big, complicated ideas beneath the surface and hold them up to the light. Not for Tartt the kind of clever riffs, halfway between standup comedy and op-ed columns, which are too commonly found in contemporary fiction. Instead, when plot comes to an end, she leads us to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place just beyond it – a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;meaning, or, as she refers to it, \"a&nbsp;rainbow edge … where all art exists, and all magic. And … all love.\"</p><p>• Kamila Shamsie's most recent book is Burnt Shadows (Bloomsbury)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419620378|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|5cf4a8e949012aaf88a859dcc5b571cc101facca -->",

        "body":"<p>The effect the modern western diet has had on our health and wellbeing has been a rumbling issue for decades; it has become more controversial recently thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/24/paleofantasy-evolution-sex-diet-review\" title=\"\">the influential evolutionary perspective on the subject</a>. When the organic food movement began, the premise was that traditional farming practices were the norm, from which we&nbsp;have departed by adopting intensive techniques to produce highly processed food. This could be dubbed the Prince Charles Line. But seen in the light of&nbsp;evolution, as Daniel Lieberman considers it, farming itself was the Great Unnatural Practice. At the extreme, the&nbsp;evolutionary perspective has given rise to the Paleo lifestyle, an attempt to return to the way we lived before the invention of farming 10,000 years ago: to live \"as evolution intended\".</p><p>Lieberman is far from endorsing such crass simplifications. Evolution, as he stresses, intends nothing. What&nbsp;actually evolves is due to many competing tendencies, and the result is&nbsp;always a work in progress with no destination. Notable figures including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough\" title=\"\">David Attenborough</a> and the geneticist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/stevejones\" title=\"\">Steve Jones</a> have remarked that human evolution has now ceased. Lieberman says this cannot be true: human beings continue to show a great degree of heritable variation, and reproductive success is also variable; so evolution of some kind must still be active. He goes further by regretting that for most of his career as a professor of human evolutionary biology he taught the old&nbsp;line that human biology has hardly changed since the Ice Age.</p><p>The question is: if human evolution is ongoing, what factors are influencing it now, as opposed to in the distant past? Genomic studies show that more&nbsp;than 100 genes indicate positive selection since farming began 10,000 years ago. Beyond the best-known example – the lactose tolerance gene, which has gone from almost zero to nearly 100% in northern Europe – most&nbsp;of them have not yet been characterised, but many almost certainly relate to the infectious diseases that accompanied hugely expanded human populations living hugger-mugger with domestic animals.</p><p>Lieberman is good at explaining why simplistic nostrums aren't appropriate for considering creatures such as human beings. We are not designed specifically to do one thing, but to be adaptable to many. Thus dark skin protects against UV radiation in equatorial regions but is gradually lost in northern climates probably because the weaker sunlight found there would generate inadequate levels of vitamin D in heavily pigmented skin. The body is&nbsp;designed to be good enough to do many things, but not to be especially good at any one of them. It doesn't have a large margin of error, unlike engineered structures such as bridges and aeroplanes, designed to withstand several times the stresses they will actually experience. Thus specialised animals out-compete us in speed, strength and visual or aural acuity, which was a problem when humans lived more or less in a state of nature.</p><p>Essentially, Lieberman's message is that modern life has created mismatches between our abilities and adaptations and the stresses we place on the body by often living thousands of miles from our family's origins, sitting down all day long rather than actively gaining a livelihood by physical work, and snatching at quick, high-energy foods.</p><p>The evolutionary approach produces some counterintuitive surprises. Fresh fruit juices are as much junk food as a cola drink – they produce a sugar rush, so it's better to eat fresh fruit with its additional fibre; chewing gum as a child is a healthy pastime, if the gum is sugar-free (teeth and jaws need the exercise that modern diets fail to provide). Without going the whole Paleo wild boar, Lieberman suggests we can learn something from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. He is a celebrated advocate of&nbsp;barefoot running, for example.</p><p>Since his book is all about trade-offs between incompatible attributes, it is only right to point out that, while his message is sound, it could have been made at half the length. In discussing the human plague&nbsp;of obesity he seems unable to resist the textual bloat that is equally a&nbsp;trait of our times. But given the vast outpouring in recent years of crank diets and earnest attempts to correct western lifestyle ills by some kind of Rousseauist regression, <em>The Story of the Human Body</em> is a reliable guide to a&nbsp;problem that is going to get worse before it gets better.</p><p><em>• </em>Peter Forbes is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780300178968\" title=\"\"><em>Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage</em></a><em>.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419929903|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|9967676dc85ad273c686392ab5716c0ad23c32e6 -->",

        "headline":"Why we need fairytales: Jeanette Winterson on Oscar Wilde",
        "body":"<p>\"Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God. It is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's day. And so&nbsp;a child could. But with me and such as I am it is different. One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long hours that follow … \"</p><p>– Oscar Wilde, \"De Profundis\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde\" title=\"\">Oscar Wilde</a> wrote \"De Profundis\" in Reading gaol where he was serving two years hard labour for being himself; he was homosexual. He was sent to prison in 1895 after one of the most notorious trials in English history. Wilde's fatal amour, Lord Alfred Douglas, was son of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/17/marquess-queensberry-linda-stratmann-review\" title=\"\">Marquess of Queensberry</a>, who was a bully, womaniser, gambling addict, cycling bore and amateur boxer (to him we owe the Queensberry rules). In his personal life there was no such thing as fair play. Queensberry was a vicious pugilist detested by his family. A caricature of masculinity, he loathed the cult of art and beauty that Wilde championed, and under the guise of saving his son from sodomy, he set about bringing down Wilde at the height of his fame.</p><p>The tragedy is that he succeeded. Wilde became the most infamous man in Britain. Queensberry bankrupted him. Even his copyrights and his library were sold. On release in 1897 he&nbsp;was forced to live abroad, separated permanently from his wife and children, who changed their name. Three years later he was dead.</p><p>Wilde loved his sons and had been a&nbsp;devoted father. He loved his wife, Constance Holland, too; in his domestic affairs, and perhaps only there, Wilde was unexpectedly conventional. He liked women, but in common with Victorian men of his class, heterosexual and homosexual alike, his interests and his excitements happened outside of the home – with other men.</p><p>Unlike other men, Wilde was flamboyant, outspoken and provocative. The all-male environments of school, university, the army, gentlemen's clubs and public life operated on a tacit code of concealment – whether of mistresses or misdemeanours. The \"love that dare not speak its name\" was a crime, yet in the eyes of society, Wilde's real crime was being found out. The Victorians didn't invent hypocrisy, but in an era of industrious taxonomy, they were the first to reclassify that sin as a virtue.</p><p>Disgraced and imprisoned, sleeping on a plank bed, his health broken, Wilde wrote a long letter to Alfred Douglas, later published as \"De Profundis\". It is&nbsp;a meditation on faith and fate, suffering and forgiveness, love and art. The strange thing is that in this, his last real piece of work, Wilde takes us back in tone and spirit to his first authentic work – the fairy stories or children's stories he wrote immediately after the birth of his two boys, Cyril and Vyvyan.</p><p>The work Wilde is remembered for was written over a period of less than 10 years. <em>The&nbsp;Happy Prince and Other Tales</em> was published in 1888. That volume marks the beginning of Wilde's true creativity. He had lectured extensively in the US – but that would not have won him any lasting legacy, any more than his journalism or his poems. He had published a great many poems, but Wilde was a bad poet – he rarely found the right words and he was old-fashioned. Read him next to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson\" title=\"\">Emily Dickinson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/walt-whitman\" title=\"\">Walt Whitman</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/wbyeats\" title=\"\">WB&nbsp;Yeats</a>, and you will see for yourself. We don't read his poetry now – it is dated and dead; too much Arcady and Hellenic Hours. The early plays suffer from the same verbal excess. Wilde at his worst wrote in purple. At his best he is dazzling.</p><p>The birth of his children seems to have regenerated Wilde as a writer. The tedious Hellenism vanished. The purple-isms faded. There are still overwritten images – Dawn's grey fingers clutching at the stars – and he never gives up his fondness for a biblical moment, usually appearing as precious stones or pronouns (thee and thy), but his style did change. The writing became freer and sharper, and also more self-reflective, without being self-absorbed.</p><p>Academic criticism of Wilde's work has too often dismissed these fairy stories as a minor bit of sentimentalism scribbled off by an iconoclast during a temporary bout of babymania. But since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling\" title=\"\">JK Rowling</a>'s Harry Potter and Philip Pullman's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philippullman\" title=\"\">His Dark Materials</a>, children's literature has been repositioned as central, not peripheral, shifting what children read, what we write about what children read, and what we&nbsp;read as adults. At last we seem to understand that imagination is ageless. Wilde's children's stories are splendid. In addition, it seems to me that they should be revisited as a defining part of&nbsp;his creative process.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420245865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381770207982/the-Happy-Prince-illustra-001.jpg' alt='the Happy Prince illustration' width='460' height='604' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The fate of the Happy Prince echoes Wilde's own reversal of fortune from fame and money to destitution and exile.   Illustration: Grahame Baker-Smith</figcaption></figure><p>\"The Happy Prince\" starts a new note in Wilde's writing: loss. Emotions as poses are a distinctive feature of Wilde's work (\"I can sympathise with everything except suffering\"), and the&nbsp;poems had their fair share of lamentation, but from now on, loss is&nbsp;not a pose; it is real.</p><p>Fairytales always involve reversals of fortune. This works in both directions: beggars become kings, palaces collapse into hovels, the spoilt son eats thistles. Wilde's own reversal of fortune from fame and money to destitution and exile shares the same rapid drama. Fairytales are also and always about transformation of various kinds – frogs into princes, coal into gold – and if they are not excessively moralistic, there is usually a happy ending. Wilde's fairytale transformations turn on loss. Even \"The Star-Child\", in which meanness and vanity are overcome by&nbsp;compassion, ends with a kingdom that lasts only three years.</p><p>Wilde had a streak of prophecy in him. The children's stories can be read as notes from the future about Wilde's fate. It is as though the little child in him was trying to warn him of the dangers his adult self would soon face. \"Every single work of art is the fulfilment of a prophecy\", he writes in \"De Profundis\".</p><p>\"The Happy Prince\" is the story of a gilded and jewelled statue on a pedestal high above the town. One day, a Swallow late-flying to Egypt, after an unsatisfactory dalliance with a reed (\"She has no conversation\"), rests at the feet of the Happy Prince, who tells him of all the suffering he can see. He asks the Swallow to take the ruby from his sword and give it to a poor family. The Swallow does so. The Prince begs him to stay and to strip him bit by bit of all his gold and jewels to distribute to others. The weather is getting colder and the Swallow knows he should fly to the sun. But as he takes the Prince's jewelled eyes, he realises that he must stay, for now the Prince is&nbsp;blind. This is&nbsp;a lovely echo of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/01/king-lear-review\" title=\"\"><em>King Lear</em></a><em>,</em> when the blinded Gloucester is not abandoned by his son Edgar – just as Cordelia never abandons the love-blind Lear.</p><p>Winter comes. The Swallow dies at the feet of the Happy Prince, no longer sparkling with jewels and gold. The Mayor has the statue pulled down – proposing one of himself in its place. As the workmen melt down the Prince they find they cannot melt his heart. They throw it on the rubbish heap next to the body of a swallow.</p><p>I don't think anything could be closer in description than this to the rubbishing of Wilde and his genius by a society obsessed by appearances and indifferent to imagination. The soul is often described as a bird – and if Wilde is the Happy Prince, then the Swallow is his soul, that returns to him and will not leave him. The Reed, shallow-rooted, flirtatious, blown about by every wind, is certainly Douglas.</p><p>Wilde believed in the soul. He played with ideas of the separation of self and soul. This is the pivot of his chilling story <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, but he explored this sinister theme for the first time in his fairy story \"The Fisherman and his Soul\". A young man wants to be rid of his Soul so that he can marry a Mermaid. He gets a magic knife from a witch and cuts away his Soul. But his Soul returns to him once a year seeking reconciliation. The story ends in death, but not in tragedy – at least not in Wilde's worldview, where Love is the supreme value. And it is Love that asks for the supreme sacrifice.</p><p>In \"The Nightingale and the Rose\", a&nbsp;Nightingale colours a white rose red with her own heart's blood so that a&nbsp;poor student will have the most beautiful flower in the world to give to&nbsp;his beloved. His beloved rejects him and his rose, and the rose is thrown in the gutter, where it is broken by a cart-wheel. As Wilde says to Douglas in \"De Profundis\": \"Having got hold of my life you didn't know what to do with it … and so you broke it.\"</p><p>Indifference to gift and sacrifice is a&nbsp;theme of these fairy stories. In \"The Birthday of the Infanta\", the haughty princess humiliates the Dwarf who loves her. In \"The Devoted Friend\", a&nbsp;selfish Miller befriends Little Hans, a&nbsp;simple soul who tends his garden. The Miller likes making speeches about friendship, and never tires of telling Little Hans that the fruit and flowers he&nbsp;takes from the garden every day are only tokens of friendship. \"At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.\" The Miller never gives anything in return, and when he has taken all there is, and Little Hans is dead of cold, hunger and exhaustion, the Miller thinks how selfish it is of Little Hans to die – not the kind of thing a friend would do at all.</p><p>When Wilde was out of prison and living on £3 a week, Douglas, who had sponged off Wilde for years, inherited £20,000. He refused to settle any money on Wilde. It was the painter Whistler, though, who was the model for the selfish Miller. Whistler was a sarcastic, self-interested friend whom Wilde ridiculed in his story \"The Remarkable Rocket\". In this tale about a batch of fireworks destined for a royal wedding, the Rocket assumes he is the&nbsp;star of the show: \"The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else.\" Whistler was uncomfortable with Wilde's success and gradually became more vicious towards him. As Queensberry closed in, Whistler abandoned Wilde. Later, when Wilde was released and struggling to write, Whistler suggested he try writing \"The&nbsp;Bugger's Opera\". But as Wilde noted, Whistler always spelt Art with a&nbsp;capital I.</p><p>Wilde had a lifelong interest in Catholicism, although he was only baptised on his deathbed. He had a theory that Christ was the perfect example of what an artist should be – a&nbsp;true individual, a political and social radical, someone who enjoyed the company of the poor and the outcast –&nbsp;as Wilde did. Someone who could forgive and in whom love was transfigured as imagination. What is the resurrection if not the triumph of imagination over experience? His most overtly religious story is \"The Selfish Giant\". In a world that&nbsp;is&nbsp;always winter, long before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/10/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe\" title=\"\">CS&nbsp;Lewis</a>&nbsp;created Narnia, Wilde's Giant is both fairytale giant and Victorian industrialist. Wilde hated the hoarding and excesses of his epoch's materialism – not because he was a socialist, but because his whole endeavour, his cult of art and beauty, was a fight against the coarsening of the soul.</p><p>When the Giant builds a wall around what is \"his\" and drives the children away, he drives away the springtime, too. His only friends are hail and snow and bitter wind. Then one day, by a miraculous intervention, unsought and&nbsp;undeserved, the children creep back through a hole in the wall, led by&nbsp;the most mysterious child of all, whom the Giant comes to love. It is this Christ-child who returns for the Giant as he dies, covering his body in white blossom – the living opposite of the snow that had for so long covered the garden. The little child is wounded in the hands and feet when he returns – but in answer to the Giant's cries of outrage and revenge, the child explains that they are \"the wounds of love\".</p><p>In <em>An Ideal Husband</em>, Lord Goring tells the devoted but puritan Lady Chiltern, \"I have sometimes thought that perhaps you are a little hard in some of your views on life … It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.\"</p><p>And so when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> says in all seriousness, \"so many of the stories I read allowed the possibility of&nbsp;frogs turning into princes; whether that has a sort of insidious effect on rationality, I'm not sure,\" we know he has made a category error.</p><p>Reason and logic are tools for understanding the world. We need a means of understanding ourselves, too. That is what imagination allows. When a child reads of a Nightingale who bleeds her song into a rose for love's sake, or of a Selfish Giant who&nbsp;puts a wall round life, or of a Fisherman who wants to be rid of his Soul, or of a statue who feels the suffering of the world more keenly than the Mathematics Master who scoffs at his pupils for dreaming about Angels, the child knows at once both the mystery and truth of such stories. We have all at some point in our lives been the overlooked idiot who finds a way to kill the dragon, win the treasure, marry the princess.</p><p>As explanations of the world, fairy stories tell us what science and philosophy cannot and need not. There&nbsp;are different ways of knowing. \"Bring me the two most precious things in the city,\" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.foliosociety.com/book/SGT/selfish-giant\" title=\"\"><em>• The Selfish Giant and Other Stories</em></a><em> by Oscar Wilde is published by the Folio Society for £24.95. </em></p><p>• This article was amended on 17 October 2013.

        "body":"<p>Eleanor Catton may have gone into the history books as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/booker-prize-eleanor-catton-luminaries\">youngest ever winner</a> of the Man Booker prize at 28, but what do the rest of those history books say? We looked at the data on every single winning author and book since 1969. The results (might) provide a (sort of) useful guide to would-be writers.</p><h2>1. If you're young, wait a bit</h2><p>There have been 44 <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/\">Booker prize</a> winners so far (three people have won twice, and once it was <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/lost-man-booker-prize\">awarded a bit ambiguously</a>). Of the winners Catton isn't just the youngest; she is only a little over half the average winner's age – 48.8. The oldest winner was William Golding, who was 69 when he won the 1980 award for his novel Rites of Passage.</p><h2>2. Write 374 pages</h2><p>Catton has also attracted attention for the length of her winning novel, at 832 pages. Size isn't everything (Penelope Fitzgerald won in 1979 with a book that was just 144 pages long) but if averages are a safe bet, you had better write 374 pages. </p><p><strong></strong></p><h2>3. Pick a short title</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420166214'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/6/1315301945774/Booker-Prize-2011-002.jpg' alt='Booker Prize 2011' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong>Winning titles tend to be three words long and contain 15.4 characters including spaces. Starting with a \"the\", like Catton's The Luminaries, isn't a bad idea – 20 of the winning books started their title with a solid three-letter definite article.</p><h2>4. Get a private education</h2><p>These days, around 7% of pupils in the UK attend an independent school, but among Booker prize winners (22 of whom were born in the UK and 28 had a British nationality when they won) it's much higher – 61% were privately educated.</p><h2>5. If you can, study in Oxford</h2><p>One in five of the winners graduated from the University of Oxford and half were educated in the UK. But a degree isn't everything – James Kelman didn't finish his course at the University of Strathclyde, Ben Okri's funding fell through at the University of Essex, Nadine Gordimer and Peter Carey dropped out while three prize winners didn't have any university education at all.</p><p><strong></strong></p><h2>6. Be a man</h2><p>30 of the 44 winners have been men. In fact, more women won the prize between 1969 and 1991 than have since. </p><h2>7. Write about death loads and love a fair bit</h2><p>This infographic created by Christian Tate looked at the 13 books longlisted for the prize in 2011 and analysed which themes occurred most frequently. Death dominated in every single book while love was a key theme in just six. Corruption and theft were dealt with five times while east London came up more often than homicidal cowboy brothers, cannibalism or an escaped tiger. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420166215'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381933008848/Plot-lines_small.png' alt='plot' width='460' height='283' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Image: Christian Tate. \nClick to expand</figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong></p><h2>8. Keep your name simple</h2><p>Only six of the winning authors used initials on their covers – PH Newby, VS Naipaul, JG Farrell, JM Coetzee, AS Byatt and DBC Pierre. The rest stuck to a straightforward forename-surname combination.</p><h2>9. Get published more, and get published with Jonathan Cape</h2><p>Only four individuals have ever won the Booker prize for their first work. On average, acclaim comes after seven published works. If you have the luxury of choosing between various publishers, go for Jonathan Cape – they have backed eight of the 48 books that have won. </p><p><strong></strong></p><h2>10. Now wait for the money</h2><p>Sales of books that win on average soar by 10.6% afterwards. However, part of that depends on how strong your standing was before the prize – Hilary Mantel's book Wolf Hall saw sales go up only 5% while Howard Jacobson's The Finkler Question received a 19% boost. </p><h2><strong>Get the numbers and get involved</strong></h2><p>• Download <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At6CC4x_yBnMdEszR2tMSXhQblhiX29UUGo5TFhkSVE&amp;usp=sharing\">the full spreadsheet</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@theguardian.com</a><br />• Follow us <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">on Twitter</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420109239|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|0139d480fb73e4580546e01ff7cb1e46fd2e2973 -->",

        "body":"<p>Years ago I asked a section editor on the paper for which I then worked whether he was going to employ a&nbsp;particular journalist. \"No, I won't,\"&nbsp;he&nbsp;replied, \"because he is an incompetent, lazy, stupid, arrogant plagiariser, who can't even write. And&nbsp;I&nbsp;speak as a friend of his.\"</p><p>Which is rather the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aitken\" title=\"\">Jonathan Aitken</a> speaks of his friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>. Here is just a selection of the words he uses to describe her – either deploying his own judgment or&nbsp;that of&nbsp;people he quotes: phoney, bullying, obnoxious, hypocritical, deplorable, unpleasant, alienating, opportunistic, confrontational, monomaniacal, disloyal, dysfunctional, snarky, pedestrian, hesitant, insufferably rude, foolish, arrogant, grudge-bearing and an&nbsp;anachronistic bigot.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prior,_Baron_Prior\" title=\"\">Jim Prior</a> found her \"vindictive and nasty\"; others spoke of \"her tendency to fly off the handle too early, her capacity to get the wrong end of the stick and her reluctance to apologise\". She was \"the least collegiate politician I have ever met … this is because she has&nbsp;no friends\". Others accuse her of&nbsp;\"governessy hatred\", of being a \"stubborn Salome\" who \"liked to hog the limelight\". Tim Bell, her favourite adman, called her \"the old bat\", and <a href=\"http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/bernard_ingham/profile.html\" title=\"\">Bernard Ingham</a>, her loyal press secretary, said she was \"the most tactless woman I have ever met in my life\".</p><p>And Aitken speaks as a friend of hers. They got off to a bad start. He ended a three-year affair with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/apr/13/carol-thatcher-tribute-mother-video\" title=\"\">Carol Thatcher</a>, and her mother said bitterly: \"He made Carol cry.\" At a dinner party, shortly after she became Tory leader, he was asked about her Middle East policies, and said: \"She knows so little … she probably thinks Sinai is the plural of sinus.\" This reached <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/09/private-eye-adam-macqueen-review\" title=\"\">Private Eye</a>, and her factotum Airey Neave demanded Aitken make an apology in&nbsp;person, in the&nbsp;division lobby: \"She'll&nbsp;be wearing a&nbsp;green dress.\"</p><p>But he is, overall, a huge admirer. He&nbsp;believes she was sound and brave&nbsp;on most foreign affairs: the Falklands,&nbsp;the ending of the cold war, the liberation of Kuwait, and the euro (though he suggests that she rewrote history when declaring she was always against our membership of the ERM).</p><p>Her judgment was less reliable in domestic affairs. Aitken points out that she could not distinguish between the striking miners and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/arthur-scargill\" title=\"\">Arthur Scargill</a>, regarding them all as members of the enemy within. That contempt for the working-class people of the north and the Midlands brought a cost that the Conservative party is still paying. The&nbsp;poll tax: surely the product of a&nbsp;disordered mind? She began to treat the people closest to her with evident contempt, most of all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/geoffrey-howe\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Howe</a> who received a bollocking in cabinet that no schoolteacher would be allowed to administer today. When the&nbsp;\"stalking donkey\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/08/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Anthony Meyer</a>, stood against her in 1989, she had a&nbsp;good campaign team in place, but the&nbsp;whips warned her that on top of the handful of votes Meyer got, there were all the abstentions, spoiled ballots and dozens of MPs who had to&nbsp;be arm-twisted into supporting her. The situation was therefore far more dangerous than it appeared. She brushed their fears aside as the hobgoblins of lesser minds, and a year later insouciantly cleared off to Paris for a ceremonial summit, which she could easily have skipped. But she loved mingling with world leaders, and&nbsp;telling them where they were wrong. Meanwhile, she left behind as her campaign manager Peter&nbsp;Morrison, a lazy alcoholic, who believed all the fake pledges of support and spent much of the campaign asleep, drunk or both.</p><p>By the time of her defenestration, she had become the world's most powerful bag lady, of the type who harangue you at bus stops, and who are&nbsp;best ignored, except that you can't ignore the prime minister. You could call her, as a female King Lear, \"a very foolish fond old woman\", except there was little fond about her – apart from some engaging nonsenses. Just before the Falklands war ended in her greatest victory – which she won by ignoring or assailing almost all her own cabinet and a&nbsp;very substantial chunk of the Tory party in parliament, plus the president of the United States and his&nbsp;most senior officials – she could be&nbsp;found cooking the food at a children's party for the families of&nbsp;Downing Street staff. Admirable in&nbsp;some ways;&nbsp;barking in others.</p><p>By the end, however, she had slipped her moorings. Even one of her most devoted supporters, the right-wing MP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Budgen\" title=\"\">Nick Budgen</a> declared that she was \"off her rocker\". She retired (Aitken says her notorious \"I shall be a very good backseat driver\" remark was directed at George Bush rather than John Major) but devoted much of her life, like Ted Heath, to trashing her successor behind his back. We all need a hobby, and that was hers. (There's another good account of this in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/highereducation.politicalbooks3\" title=\"\">John Sergeant's book <em>Maggie</em></a>.)</p><p>The Fall of Thatcher could be staged, not least because hers was a very modern hubris. Having started out lacking in real confidence – her first cabinet was stuffed with grandees who opposed all that she stood for – she was brought down in the end by believing her own publicity. She adopted with wild enthusiasm the \"iron lady\" sobriquet coined by the USSR army newspaper, forgetting that everything in those Soviet rags was lies and propaganda. I recall a grandiloquent speech, after the fall, to American travel agents in Glasgow, who must have been puzzled to learn she had ended the cold war herself, with Ronald Reagan as Robin to her Batman. She could give solipsism a bad name.</p><p>The pleasure of Aitken's readable, even beguiling, book is in the anecdotes. He suspects that her breathtakingly arrogant attempt to&nbsp;stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/08/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Bernard Weatherill</a> from becoming&nbsp;Speaker – something she had absolutely no right to do – helped bring her down. He arranged that Howe's killer speech in 1990 would be heard when the chamber was full, and in complete silence, giving it maximum effect. She realised then that the end was near, but couldn't grasp even then her&nbsp;own contribution to the coming catastrophe, and chose to blame the cabinet instead – \"treachery with a&nbsp;smile on its face\".</p><p>Then there was the time she went to&nbsp;holiday on Islay: the host family's noisy offspring meant she was unable to sleep, so she went for a walk in a hooded coat. Mistaken by a security officer for a sinister intruder, she was pinned to the wet moorland by a slavering police dog. For some anti-Thatcherites, that story alone will be worth the price of the book.</p><p>One day we might reach a reasonable assessment of Thatcher, somewhere between the adulation and the loathing: she achieved a reasonable amount economically at home (while pitching us into the tooth-and-claw capitalism we suffer today), had some influence on the world stage, and in the last few years in power lost the plot. This book, by an alarmingly candid friend, will go a long way towards helping find&nbsp;that balance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420022360|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|6c0c5412dc305d7276e1843c42099bfe2655b095 -->",

        "headline":"The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt – review",
        "body":"<p>It is dangerous to write openings as compelling as Donna Tartt's. In <em>The Secret History</em>, the one-page prologue gives us a murder and a narrator who has helped to commit it. <em>The Little Friend</em> starts with the death of a child who, by page 15, is found hanging by a&nbsp;piece of rope from a tree branch, his red hair \"the only thing about him that&nbsp;was the right colour any more\". And now, in <em>The Goldfinch</em>, Tartt has a 50‑page two-part opening. In the first section, the narrator, Theo Decker, is&nbsp;holed up in an Amsterdam hotel, looking at newspapers written in Dutch, which he can't understand; he&nbsp;is searching for his name in articles illustrated with pictures of police cars and crime scene tapes. Before any of this is explained, the story moves back 14&nbsp;years to the day Theo's mother dies, when he is on the cusp of adolescence. Her death takes place in New York's Metropolitan Museum, as a consequence of an exploding bomb – mother and son are in separate rooms when the bomb blast occurs, and the descriptions of Theo regaining consciousness in the wreckage, and trying to find his way out of the ripped-apart museum before returning home, expecting to find his mother there, are&nbsp;written in astonishingly gripping prose. This is, of course, where the danger comes in: if, at the end of the kind of set piece to which the word \"climactic\" should emphatically apply, you still have 700 pages to go, aren't you setting your readers up for disappointment?</p><p>Astonishingly, the answer is no. The novel changes gear and, for a while, is primarily involved with showing us, affectingly, the dislocation of Theo's life – a dislocation both emotional and physical. His mother dead, his father long absent, he finds himself living with the Barbours, the family of a&nbsp;school friend; this is understood by everyone to be a short-term option, and the cold spectre of unknown and unloving grandparents who will eventually become Theo's guardians hovers over the novel for a time until his father reappears, with his girlfriend Xandra, and takes Theo off to live with him in Las Vegas. There will be more twists and turns in this tale of a&nbsp;motherless boy whose life involves dramatic changes and is peopled with a&nbsp;vast cast of characters, many of whose affections and intentions it isn't&nbsp;easy to work out. If there's any one novel this strand of the story calls to mind, it's<em> Great Expectations</em> – there's even a character called Pippa, perhaps a playful melding of Pip and Estella. Pippa, near Theo in age, was also in the&nbsp;museum when the bomb exploded, and is the only person who Theo feels can understand his heart.</p><p>But there is a second strand to the novel, this one with echoes of <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. Young Theo Decker enters a museum with his mother; he&nbsp;leaves with a painting. The painting – one that actually exists in the world – is <a href=\"http://www.wga.hu/html_m/f/fabritiu/carel/goldfinc.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Goldfinch</em> by Carel Fabritius</a>, a&nbsp;student of Rembrandt's, who died at&nbsp;the age of 32 when a gunpowder factory near his studio exploded. Almost all his work was destroyed; <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> is widely considered the finest of the paintings that survived. \"Anything we manage to save from history is a miracle,\" Theo's mother says to him, minutes before her death – an idea that runs deep in the veins of&nbsp;the novel. Picking up the painting from the debris and walking out of the museum with it isn't exactly theft, not if theft involves the conscious decision to steal. Theo is acting in a state of mental distress, on the instructions of&nbsp;a dying man who tells him to take the painting. This man, it so happens, is guardian to Pippa – at this point, she&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing more to Theo than an arresting-looking girl, all too briefly glimpsed, though, later, their lives will collide and separate, repeatedly.</p><p>But once Theo reads in the newspaper that the painting is believed to have been destroyed in the explosion, he chooses to keep quiet about his possession of it – and from here on, he&nbsp;is culpable. As the years go on, both Theo's attachment to the painting (a&nbsp;thing of beauty, but also a physical connection to one of the last conversations he had with his mother) and his guilt over his continued possession of such a priceless work of art grows. So, too, does his fear of being imprisoned for stealing the object. It should come as no surprise, in a novel that opens with crime scene tapes and exploding museums, that the story of Theo and the painting is a story of betrayal, suspicion, double-dealing and shoot-outs. Raymond Chandler is no less a&nbsp;presence here than Dickens and Dostoyevsky. To say any more about the events of the novel would be to deprive a reader of the great joy of being swept up by the plot. If anyone has lost their love of storytelling, <em>The&nbsp;Goldfinch</em> should most certainly return it to them.</p><p>The novel isn't, of course, all action and suspense. Some of its most memorable moments occur in stillness. Take Theo's first experience of the desert skies of Las&nbsp;Vegas, after a life spent amid the light pollution of New York. Until now, he has only known the constellations as \"childhood patterns that had twinkled me to sleep from the glow-in‑the-dark planetarium stars on my bedroom ceiling back in New York. Now, transfigured – cold and glorious like deities with their disguises flung off – it was as if they'd flown through the roof and into the sky to assume their true, celestial homes.\" It is a&nbsp;glorious piece of prose, but placed within a novel about a boy who has lost his true home – which is, wherever his mother might be – it becomes heart-piercing, too. Tartt may already have displayed her great gift for plot in her debut, but the emotional register of <em>The Goldfinch</em> is of a different order from either of her previous works.</p><p>It would be wrong, however, to think that all the emotions are centred around loss. At the heart of the novel is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evocation of boyhood friendship – that of Theo and Boris, the&nbsp;Ukrainian outsider he meets on his first day of&nbsp;school in Las Vegas. Boris is an unforgettable creation – a thieving, drinking, drug-taking teenager who lights up each page he is on, even as he&nbsp;leads Theo into a world of excess. Their relationship works so well on the&nbsp;page in part because it has been prefigured by Theo's friendship, in New&nbsp;York, with a boy called Tom Cable – a friendship with a \"wild, manic quality, something unhinged and hectic and a little perilous about it\". Tartt doesn't present Theo as&nbsp;someone who comes unmoored from his own character by the death of his mother, but, more convincingly, as a&nbsp;boy whose&nbsp;flaws become more deeply inscribed in him as a consequence of&nbsp;loss. Then again, it&nbsp;is not entirely right to think of Theo's friendship with Boris&nbsp;as a flaw – the love between the boys is both simple and complicated, in the way of the best friendships. And&nbsp;when Boris re-enters Theo's life in adulthood it is impossible not to hope he is there as a friend, even while fearing the opposite.</p><p>Plot and character and fine prose can&nbsp;take you far – but a novel this good makes you want to go even further. The last few pages of the novel take all&nbsp;the serious, big, complicated ideas beneath the surface and hold them up to the light. Not for Tartt the kind of clever riffs, halfway between standup comedy and op-ed columns, which are too commonly found in contemporary fiction. Instead, when plot comes to an end, she leads us to&nbsp;a&nbsp;place just beyond it – a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;meaning, or, as she refers to it, \"a&nbsp;rainbow edge … where all art exists, and all magic. And … all love.\"</p><p>• Kamila Shamsie's most recent book is Burnt Shadows (Bloomsbury)</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419620378|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|5cf4a8e949012aaf88a859dcc5b571cc101facca -->",

        "headline":"Her Brilliant Career: Ten Extraordinary Women of the Fifties by Rachel Cooke – review",
        "body":"<p>At the end of <em>My Brilliant Career</em>, the 1901 novel by Miles Franklin (who was actually Stella Miles Franklin), the heroine who dreamed of becoming a writer is left thwarted and misunderstood, with little prospect of making the life she imagined. Rachel Cooke invokes that sad inheritance in her title, but does not dwell on it. Hers is an exuberant, glass-chinking book about 10 women a couple of generations later who – with phenomenal energy and determination – built the brilliant careers they wanted.</p><p>This is a splendidly various collection of \"brief lives\" written with both gusto&nbsp;and sensitivity. Most readers will&nbsp;know some of the subjects, but not&nbsp;all. There&nbsp;is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alison-smithson-1462016.html\" title=\"\">Alison Smithson</a>, the modernist architect. Margery Fish, gardener and&nbsp;plantswoman. The barrister Rose Heilbron, later a high court judge. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/18/guardianobituaries.food\" title=\"\">Patience Gray</a>, the cookery writer who far out-sold Elizabeth David. The archaeologist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes\" title=\"\">Jacquetta Hawkes, author of that sensuous geological masterpiece <em>A Land</em></a>.</p><p>One chapter is inhabited by three of&nbsp;Cooke's Tremendous 10 (and yes, there is a touch of the hockey-stick in the tone, but the effect is generally invigorating). They lived in a crowded three-way relationship, so it all makes sense: the journalist Nancy Spain, Joan&nbsp;Werner Laurie, founder of She magazine, and Sheila Van Damm, who trained as a formation flying pilot, found there was no place for women in aviation, wondered what to do, and then became a racing driver. Sisters-in-law <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Box\" title=\"\">Muriel Box</a> and Betty Box share a&nbsp;chapter because they were both making their way in the film industry. This is Betty Box who became Betty Box Office after producing the huge hit <em>Doctor in the House</em>. She had insisted on casting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/10/guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Dirk Bogarde</a>; nobody else had thought he was much good.</p><p>Box looks sensational in the photos, taking a coffee break with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/katharinehepburn\" title=\"\">Katharine Hepburn</a>, but it's important that Cooke studies directors and producers rather than the on-screen stars. All her subjects are poised between being exceptional individuals and being trailblazers in paths we might aspire to follow. She purposely decided not to write about Celia Johnson and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/31/biography.stage\" title=\"\">Margot Fonteyn</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\" title=\"\">Sylvia Plath</a> was never in contention. So, though we're used to reading about the lives of the great artists, writers and thinkers, this book is not about them. On the other hand, though we're increasingly drawn to what Woolf called \"infinitely obscure lives\" that \"remain to be recorded\", this is not a project of recovery. The idea, appealingly, is to think about women who became well-known for being terrifically good at what they did. They were professional pioneers of the 1950s, respected by their peers and remembered admiringly, perhaps not by millions, but certainly by those working in related fields. They&nbsp;were all career women when that&nbsp;was rare, and today's working women are in their debt.</p><p>I am ashamed that, though I have an office next to the law faculty at the University of Liverpool, I did not know the story of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/13/guardianobituaries.gender\" title=\"\">Rose Heilbron</a>, who studied here in the early 1930s. She became the second woman in the country to get a first-class law degree, before going on to take silk in her mid-30s. The court reporters loved the twinkle in her eyes and the angle of her wig, though eventually everyone had to concede that there was a bit more to her than that. When she successfully defended striking dockers in 1951, crowds of Liverpool workers lined the platform at&nbsp;Lime Street to salute her&nbsp;return.</p><p>Heilbron and Smithson stand out as the only representatives of women in \"the professions\" – this is not a book of office jobs. The triumphs of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/nov/30/shopping.gardens\" title=\"\">Margery Fish</a> are in her&nbsp;garden at East Lambrook, where she collected thousands of&nbsp;plant varieties. In housecoat and sturdy shoes, she did not look the ultimate career woman. Nor did Patience Gray, learning to cook in the billiard room bedsit of a Gothic house, and later living \"wild\" in Apulia, \"wizened and witchy-looking\", skinning foxes and harvesting weeds.</p><p>But this is part of Cooke's point. Careers are made from inventiveness, willpower and addiction. Her gardeners and food-writers were no dabbling hobbyists; 12-hour days were standard.</p><p>Some of these women knew from the age of about five exactly what they wanted to do. Their rehearsals for life are admirable and touching. The logistics of reading long past bedtime can be challenging enough, but the future Jacquetta Hawkes needed to practice being an archaeologist. She drew bison&nbsp;on the garden wall to set the prehistoric scene. And then she snuck out at night to conduct excavations in the lawn, labouring into the small hours with torch and trowel.</p><p>Success took time. Muriel Box trained as a typist, lived on sausage rolls from the ABC restaurant, and got a job at a corset factory in Welwyn. At least she was independent: it was a start. There is an affecting story about what Heilbron did when her mother was dying, young, of cancer. Rose was still in training and was yet to be called to the bar, but she went out and hired, illicitly, a wig and gown. She allowed her mother to see, just once, the figure her daughter was on course to become.</p><p>Once each woman is launched, personal and professional lives compete for space on the page. The practical questions matter: what time will she get home at night? Who mowed the lawn? How long is the baby&nbsp;in that Moses basket by the desk going to be asleep? There is usually an unsatisfactory marriage to escape, and Cooke tells some astounding stories of wild passions, secret pregnancies and deceived children.</p><p>These sensations are never quite allowed to steal the show, because the real drama here is in the work. It's true that from the outside hard graft can look a little dull. What Heilbron's university contemporaries remember is that \"she was always working in the library. I don't remember seeing her at any dances.\" This can be troublesome when you're trying to tell a pacey tale; textbooks are not spectacular. Cooke leaves the scholar to her own devices in the library, and catches up with her later when she's standing to give some nicely devastating after-dinner speech. Still, the compromise is understandable. Brief lives rely on abbreviation, and Cooke makes an art of it. This is a book in which people get MBEs for things they do in a sub-clause, and yet somehow we come to feel the long-haul nature of their efforts.</p><p>Resilience and stamina are much in&nbsp;evidence. \"They were as tough as boots,\" Cooke says approvingly of the&nbsp;Boxes: \"They ate setbacks for breakfast.\" But no one who's any good takes things so easily. Later we meet Muriel looking altogether less boot-like, coping with the \"low moods, painful joints, exhaustion, various infections and fevers\" that routinely accompanied the process of making a film. When her subjects do eventually make it to the top, Cooke watches carefully what they do with their success. Are they freer, or happier? Are they impossible with their friends? Betty Box ordered up a floor-length mink coat and adored it, though on set in India she preferred to wear a poncho with secret pockets in which she could hide contraband gin for the crew.</p><p>\"The bliss of work! The balm of it, and the satisfaction.\" Cooke is speaking partly on behalf of her 1950s subjects: this is what, at some point, they all felt. She is also speaking openly and passionately for herself. Yes, work is boring or nerve-racking or sleep-depriving, but the pleasure, too, should be acknowledged and fostered. In a brilliant passage, she reads Alison Smithson's designs for the&nbsp;interior of <a href=\"http://postwarbuildings.com/buildings/the-economist-buildings\" title=\"\">the Economist Buildings</a> as a tribute to the professional lives that would be lived there:</p><p>\"This was again Alison's realm, and&nbsp;included a filing system in the form of&nbsp;glorious Japanese-inspired lacquer boxes. Pillar-box red and silk smooth to the touch … A woman who&nbsp;understood more than most the&nbsp;power and comfort of work, she could have paid the Economist's harried secretaries and journalists no greater compliment than to imbue their daily rituals with beauty, and just&nbsp;a hint of the clandestine.\"</p><p>In a painfully slow job market, many&nbsp;graduates of 2013 will find themselves at temporary desks eating sausage rolls for lunch, trying secretly, stubbornly to keep their ambitions in view. They will think it is a rare privilege to know the \"balm\" of doing what you love, though they will surely agree it is worth aiming for. So let's talk&nbsp;about quotas, let's talk about pay, and let's follow Cooke's lead in remembering to talk about joy.</p><p>• Alexandra Harris's <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudson.com/Virginia_Woolf/9780500290866\" title=\"\"><em>Virginia Woolf</em></a><em> is published by Thames and Hudson.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419928053|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|cbaf80366cc5d8a1d55e98bc0772a766a9615600 -->",

        "headline":"Comic and graphic novel stars take over Kendal for new festival showcase",
        "body":"<p>There's a new kind of comic event coming to our shores, modelled not on the superhero-focused all-American approach, but on a much closer neighbour: the European comic festival. With founder patrons including the Costa prize-winning Mary and Bryan Talbot, the <a href=\"http://www.comicartfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Lakes International comic art festival</a> has an eclectic guest list, from the artist of The Walking Dead, Charlie Adlard, to the graphic journalist Joe Sacco.</p><p>And unlike a fair number of other conventions, which have come under fire in the past few years for only inviting only one or two women guests – if any – this weekend's event taking over the whole of Kendal, Cumbria, aims to include talents old and new from both sides of the gender divide.</p><p>Long-time Guardian favourite and multiple award-winner Posy Simmonds is one such guest, a prolific artist who has been drawing comics since she was a little girl. Her collection last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/19/mrs-webers-omnibus-posy-simmonds\" title=\"\">Mrs Weber's Omnibus</a>, brought together her <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224096836\" title=\"\">long-running strips for the Guardian</a> about a well-meaning middle-class family.</p><p>\"As a child,\" Simmonds tells me, \"I liked the combination of words and pictures -  in bound copies of Punch magazines and, later, in the piles of comics some American kids used to give me. There was also something subversive about comics that appealed - adults didn't approve of them.\"</p><p>That subversiveness has long been a key component of the medium, and something that has tied comics to women's history throughout the decades. Visiting from the US, the cartoonist <a href=\"http://www.trinarobbins.com/Trina_Robbins/Welcome.html\" title=\"\">Trina Robbins</a> will be discussing her half-century career in comics, from her beginnings as one of the most influential underground comix artists in the 1970s, when she led the feminist charge against the boys' club attitude that prevailed at the time.</p><p>But comics and feminism have been intertwined long before underground comix hit the counterculture scene, as can be seen in the movement covered in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/02/costa-awards-graphic-novel-biography\" title=\"\">Mary Talbot</a>'s second graphic novel, Sally Heathcote: Suffragette (Jonathan Cape, to be published May 2014), illustrated by Edinburgh artist <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-10104994556,00.html\" title=\"\">Kate Charlesworth</a>.</p><p>\"I seem to have arrived at comics accidentally,\" Charlesworth says. \"I've never aspired to art or literature, but  comics are an astonishingly accommodating medium - narrative and visuals creating something bigger than the sum of their parts - like two good collaborators getting together.\"</p><p>The late 19th and early 20th century witnessed the Suffragette struggle on many fronts, and cartoonists did battle in the pages of newspapers. A history of the movement in this very medium is perhaps rather fitting.</p><p>\"Comics can put the drama and humanity back into histories which may have been stripped back to key facts,\" Charlesworth says, \"and also have the space to investigate complex issues, in this case feminism. Both sides in the suffrage debate employed cartoons and comic narratives as powerful propaganda tools.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420243675'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/17/1382005675888/mary-and-bryan-talbot-010.jpg' alt='mary and bryan talbot' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Mary and Brian Talbot, patrons of the Lakes International comic art festival. Photograph: PA</figcaption></figure><p>The ability of comics to  explore issues is something that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/28/anorexia-affects-everyone-family-katie-green\" title=\"\">Katie Green</a> has made the most of in her first graphic novel, Lighter Than My Shadow (Jonathan Cape). The story of her own  struggle with an eating disorder, it's a heavy book, both literally and in subject matter.</p><p>\"Comics is a very accessible medium,\" Green explains. \"You don't need any fancy equipment or a special place to display them, you can start with just a pen and some paper. I'm a very visual person, but I am also a control freak.  When making comics you have ultimate control over every aspect of set and costume design, pacing and storytelling, character and dialogue, while still creating something visual and utterly immersive in a way that the written word isn't.\"</p><p>\"Reading a comic is very intimate,\" she continues, \"and for me that was always a comfort when drawing about such personal stuff: that it would be experienced by one person at a time in the privacy of their own reading. Also the combination of visual language with text gives so many possibilities for expression: there are things words can say that images can't, and likewise things images can say that words can't. But there are also things that can only be said with both words and images working together, a language that is unique to comics.\"</p><p>For others looking to work out their own difficult issues on the page, Green advises: \"If it feels important to tell, tell it. The more we talk about the difficult things, the less difficult they become to talk about.\"</p><p>Relative newcomer Isabel Greenberg has made a big impact in the last couple of years, and the winner of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/observer-graphic-short-story-prize\" title=\"\">Jonathan Cape/Observer/Comica graphic short story prize</a> in 2011 has now released her first graphic novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/14/encyclopedia-early-earth-isabel-greenberg\" title=\"\">The Encyclopedia of Early Earth</a> (Jonathan Cape). Unfortunately she has also experienced one of the major difficulties many comic creators experience in the mainstream press – condescension.  A <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/03/graphic-novelist-isabel-greenberg-dont-put-that-in-it-makes-me-sound-super-nerdy-4132040/\" title=\"\">recent interview</a> described her as a \"petite blonde\", \"princess\", and compared her to Tinkerbell.</p><p>Greenberg hasn't felt sidelined in the UK comics scene itself however, and certainly indie comic fairs have a very even gender split. \"Generations of women have struggled so that I can be so lucky,\" she tells me.</p><p>One such generation of course includes Posy Simmonds and Trina Robbins. Pretty in Ink (Fantagraphics, December), Robbins's most recent \"herstorian\" or feminist history, illustrates the struggles that women artists and cartoonists have faced across the decades. But overall, coverage of comics and women creators has almost certainly improved - not least because the audience is ever expanding, and increasingly diverse.</p><p>\"Graphic novels and comics are getting a bit more attention in the mainstream media,\" says Simmonds. \"Nothing like the attention paid to comics in France and Belgium, say, but a big difference from 20 years ago. I remember telling someone I was writing a graphic serial and they said 'Graphic? Why're you writing filth?'\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicartfestival.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Lakes International Comic Art Festival runs from October 18-20; comicartfestival.com</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420236994|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|638d7db46da4e70a1e76c9ce2651262193ca52b1 -->",

        "headline":"Top 10 books for Black History month",
        "body":"<p>The US civil rights movement is a perennially popular topic that has spawned a massive body of literature. </p><p>What interests me about its history is how it engages with questions of race relations that are at the heart of US history: how a nation that became the world's model for democracy was born in the shadow of slavery; how that issue tore apart the nation in a bloody civil war; and how, despite that war, a new system of racial discrimination based on segregation, disenfranchisement and economic exploitation persisted well into the latter half of the 20th century. </p><p>I'm also interested in how the civil rights and black power movements emerged from grassroots activism, transforming some aspects of racial discrimination but leaving many other elements intact. The issues the civil rights movement raised are still relevant today – and not only in the US.</p><h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/biography/king-a-biography,david-levering-lewis-9780252079092\" title=\"\">King: A Critical Biography</a> by David L Lewis</h2><p>Of the many worthy contenders to choose from, I particularly like Lewis's 1970 biography of Martin Luther King, because it was one of the first to take on the task after King's assassination in 1968. While sympathetic to King, the book is not afraid to point to his shortcomings. Revealingly – and perhaps a reflection of King's acceptance into the pantheon of American heroes – subsequent editions have dropped the word &quot;critical&quot; from the title.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ella-Baker-Black-Freedom-Movement/dp/0807856169\" title=\"\">Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision</a> by Barbara Ransby<br /></h2><p>For many years, women's roles in the civil rights movement were neglected. Ransby's study charts the remarkable life of activist Ella Baker, who played an influential organising and leadership role over many decades and helped establish the foundations for King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Ransby offers a fascinating portrait of one of the movement's forgotten true heroes.</p><h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Prophet-Times-Bayard-Rustin/dp/0226142698\" title=\"\">Lost Prophet: The Life and Times of Bayard Rustin</a> by John D'Emilio </h2><p>Rustin is another previously overlooked figure. Gay, pacifist, communist and Quaker, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/bayard-rustin-march-on-washington\" title=\"\">Bayard Rustin</a> was largely kept out of view so as not to attract unwelcome publicity. He was pivotal in organising the 1963 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/28/march-on-washington-50th-anniversary-live\" title=\"\">March on Washington</a> and he was a close advisor to King on nonviolence. D'Emilio's gender studies perspective broaches the touchy subject of sexuality in civil rights studies.</p><h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/In-Struggle-Black-Awakening-1960s/dp/0674447271\" title=\"\">In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s</a> by Clayborne Carson </h2><p>In the 1960s, many organisations contributed to the success of the civil rights movement. Few were as influential as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced &quot;snick&quot;). A youth-based movement, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee\" title=\"\">SNCC</a> led daring direct action protests such as <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/sncc/\" title=\"\">sit-ins at segregated lunch counters</a> and <a href=\"http://century.theguardian.com/1960-1969/Story/0,,105534,00.html\" title=\"\">freedom rides</a>. Carson, a former SNCC member and now the director of the <a href=\"http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/kingpapers/index\" title=\"\">Martin Luther King Jr Papers project</a>, skillfully offers scholarly insight combined with first-hand experience.</p><h2>5. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Civilities-Civil-Rights-Greensboro-Carolina/dp/0195029194\" title=\"\">Civilities and Civil Rights: Greensboro, North Carolina and the Black Struggle for Freedom</a> by William H Chafe<br /></h2><p>Chafe's book was one of the first to examine the civil rights movement from a &quot;bottom up&quot; grassroots perspective. He places the protests that launched the 1960 sit-in movement in a much broader context and a longer history of black activism. This was the first book I read as a graduate student, and it provided a model and inspiration for my own PhD thesis, which took the Little Rock school integration crisis of 1957 as its point of departure.</p><h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cold-War-Civil-Rights-Democracy/dp/0691152438\" title=\"\">Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy</a> by Mary L Dudziak</h2><p>In recent years, historians have begun to examine the civil rights movement within the context of international relations. Dudziak shows that the cold war made the US far more conscious of how it treated people of colour at home as it competed with the Soviet Union to win non-white hearts and minds abroad. Her book charts new territory in exploring international dimensions that shaped the movement – and how the movement shaped international relations.</p><h2>7. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Simple-Justice-Education-Americas-Struggle/dp/1400030617\" title=\"\">Simple Justice: The History of Brown v Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality </a>by Richard Kluger</h2><p>The struggle for desegregation in education preceded and outlasted the civil rights movement's heyday of the 1950s and 1960s. Kluger charts the legal struggle by the NAACP, the US's oldest civil rights organisation, which led to the landmark Brown school desegregation decision in 1954. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usa/brown/0,,1216081,00.html\" title=\"\">history of the Brown decision</a> reminds us that the movement was built on decades of previous black activism. Kluger's talent is to focus on the human story and drama in the midst of describing complex courtroom proceedings.</p><h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Land-Liberty-Forgotten-Struggle/dp/B004JZWZK0\" title=\"\">Sweet Land of Liberty: The Forgotten Struggle for Civil Rights in the North by Thomas J Sugrue</a></h2><p>We often think of the civil rights movement as a distinct episode in the history of the US south. More recent studies like Sugrue's have shown that discrimination against African Americans existed nationwide, as did African American struggles to overcome it. His book not only challenges us to reconsider the chronology of the movement beyond the 1950s and 1960s, but also shifts its geographic coordinates to marshal an enormous wealth of research and an impressively diverse range of events.</p><h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Just-Soul-Responding-Consciousness-Relations/dp/185728139X\" title=\"\">Just My Soul Responding: Rhythm and Blues, Black Consciousness and Race Relations</a> by Brian Ward<br /></h2><p>The civil rights movement changed US politics and society, but its cultural impact was just as important. Ward's provocative study argues that black music did not just absorb influences but that it profoundly shaped the movement – from the artists and the venues they played, to the music industry and the role of African American-oriented radio. The author's exhaustive research turns up some fascinating episodes that reveal just how profound the movement's impact on popular culture was.</p><h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Waiting-Til-Midnight-Hour-Narrative/dp/0805083359\" title=\"\">Waiting 'Til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America</a> by Peniel E Joseph </h2><p>Was the black power movement part of the civil rights movement, or something separate? Joseph, a leading figure in the <a href=\"http://www.penielejoseph.com/legacy.html\" title=\"\">new black power studies</a>, makes the case for its singularity in the most comprehensive overview of the topic published to date. Rather than seeing black power as a series of unconnected iconic episodes and images – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/25/black-panthers-photographs-howard-bingham\" title=\"\">Black Panthers toting guns</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\" title=\"\">clenched fist salutes at the 1968 Olympics</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Davis\" title=\"\">Angela Davis</a>'s loud and proud Afro – Joseph presents a picture of a coherent movement with its own distinct politics and sensibilities.</p><p><em>John A Kirk is the author of three books on Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement.

        "body":"<p>Thomas Pynchon, Jhumpa Lahiri and George Saunders were among the finalists Wednesday for the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Awards.</p> <p>A month after releasing longlists of 10 in each of the four competitive categories, the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book Foundation announced the five remaining writers for fiction, non-fiction, poetry and young people's literature.</p> <p>Winners receive $10,000 and will be announced at a dinner ceremony in Manhattan on 20 November.</p> <p>All five fiction nominees are well established, from Pynchon, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/16/thomas-pynchon-bleeding-edge\">Bleeding Edge</a> is set in Manhattan around the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks; to Lahiri, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/12/lowland-jhumpa-lahiri-review\">The Lowland</a> was a Booker finalist; to Saunders, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/tenth-of-december-george-saunders-review\">Tenth of December </a>was the rare short story collection to make bestseller lists. The other finalists are Rachel Kushner, nominated for her highly praised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/23/flamethrowers-rachel-kushner-review\">The Flamethrowers</a>, and James McBride, known to millions for The Color of Water and a finalist for The Good Lord Bird.</p> <p>The non-fiction list features three&nbsp;books&nbsp;by New Yorker staff writers: Lawrence Wright's Scientology investigation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/02/going-clear-scientology-wright-review\">Going Clear</a>; George Packer's dire account of contemporary America, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/21/unwinding-history-america-packer-review\">The Unwinding</a>; and Jill Lepore's biography of Benjamin Franklin's sister, Jane Franklin, The&nbsp;Book&nbsp;of Ages. Also nominated for nonfiction are Wendy Lower's Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields, and Alan Taylor's The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772-1832.</p> <p>For poetry, the finalists are Frank Bidart's Metaphysical Dog, Lucie Brock-Broido's Stay, Illusion, Adrian Matejka's The Big Smoke, Matt Rasmussen's Black Aperture, and Mary Szybist's \"Incarnadine.\"</p> <p>The young people's literature nominees are Kathi Appelt's The True Blue Scouts of Sugar Man Swamp, Cynthia Kadohata's The Thing About Luck, Tom McNeal's Far Far Away, Meg Rosoff's Picture Me Gone and Gene Luen Yang's Boxers &amp; Saints, a two-volume graphic novel.</p> <p>Four of the fiction finalists were published by imprints of the recently merged Penguin Random House, which released 10 of the 20 nominees overall.</p> <p>The longlists were started this year as part of an effort to increase awareness of the&nbsp;awards&nbsp;and lead to more sales. New York publishers, several of whom are represented on the foundation's board, have complained that fiction nominees in recent years have been too obscure and have cited Britain's Man Booker Prize as a model. Besides establishing longlists, the foundation has expanded the pool of judges, once exclusively writers, to include journalists, booksellers and librarians.</p> <p>The foundation would likely settle for the success of the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Award&nbsp;fiction winner from 2012, Louise Erdrich's The Round House, which has sold more than 300,000 copies. Erdrich's publisher, HarperCollins, credited much of that success to the&nbsp;award.</p> <p>Honorary winners include Maya Angelou, whose medal will be presented by Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, and EL Doctorow, who will be introduced by the publisher emeritus of The&nbsp;Nation&nbsp;and former&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Awardwinner Victor Navasky.</p> <p>The&nbsp;National&nbsp;Book&nbsp;Foundation, which presents the&nbsp;awards, is a nonprofit organization that sponsors numerous writing and educational events and programs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420147418|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|dda75cc81fb1d834a0305cdd4502909bfb10d859 -->",

        "body":"<p>Eleanor Catton may have gone into the history books as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/15/booker-prize-eleanor-catton-luminaries\">youngest ever winner</a> of the Man Booker prize at 28, but what do the rest of those history books say? We looked at the data on every single winning author and book since 1969. The results (might) provide a (sort of) useful guide to would-be writers.</p><h2>1. If you're young, wait a bit</h2><p>There have been 44 <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/\">Booker prize</a> winners so far (three people have won twice, and once it was <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/lost-man-booker-prize\">awarded a bit ambiguously</a>). Of the winners Catton isn't just the youngest; she is only a little over half the average winner's age – 48.8. The oldest winner was William Golding, who was 69 when he won the 1980 award for his novel Rites of Passage.</p><h2>2. Write 374 pages</h2><p>Catton has also attracted attention for the length of her winning novel, at 832 pages. Size isn't everything (Penelope Fitzgerald won in 1979 with a book that was just 144 pages long) but if averages are a safe bet, you had better write 374 pages. </p><p><strong></strong></p><h2>3. Pick a short title</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420166214'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/6/1315301945774/Booker-Prize-2011-002.jpg' alt='Booker Prize 2011' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong>Winning titles tend to be three words long and contain 15.4 characters including spaces. Starting with a \"the\", like Catton's The Luminaries, isn't a bad idea – 20 of the winning books started their title with a solid three-letter definite article.</p><h2>4. Get a private education</h2><p>These days, around 7% of pupils in the UK attend an independent school, but among Booker prize winners (22 of whom were born in the UK and 28 had a British nationality when they won) it's much higher – 61% were privately educated.</p><h2>5. If you can, study in Oxford</h2><p>One in five of the winners graduated from the University of Oxford and half were educated in the UK. But a degree isn't everything – James Kelman didn't finish his course at the University of Strathclyde, Ben Okri's funding fell through at the University of Essex, Nadine Gordimer and Peter Carey dropped out while three prize winners didn't have any university education at all.</p><p><strong></strong></p><h2>6. Be a man</h2><p>30 of the 44 winners have been men. In fact, more women won the prize between 1969 and 1991 than have since. </p><h2>7. Write about death loads and love a fair bit</h2><p>This infographic created by Christian Tate looked at the 13 books longlisted for the prize in 2011 and analysed which themes occurred most frequently. Death dominated in every single book while love was a key theme in just six. Corruption and theft were dealt with five times while east London came up more often than homicidal cowboy brothers, cannibalism or an escaped tiger. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420166215'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381933008848/Plot-lines_small.png' alt='plot' width='460' height='283' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Image: Christian Tate. \nClick to expand</figcaption></figure><p><strong></strong></p><h2>8. Keep your name simple</h2><p>Only six of the winning authors used initials on their covers – PH Newby, VS Naipaul, JG Farrell, JM Coetzee, AS Byatt and DBC Pierre. The rest stuck to a straightforward forename-surname combination.</p><h2>9. Get published more, and get published with Jonathan Cape</h2><p>Only four individuals have ever won the Booker prize for their first work. On average, acclaim comes after seven published works. If you have the luxury of choosing between various publishers, go for Jonathan Cape – they have backed eight of the 48 books that have won. </p><p><strong></strong></p><h2>10. Now wait for the money</h2><p>Sales of books that win on average soar by 10.6% afterwards. However, part of that depends on how strong your standing was before the prize – Hilary Mantel's book Wolf Hall saw sales go up only 5% while Howard Jacobson's The Finkler Question received a 19% boost. </p><h2><strong>Get the numbers and get involved</strong></h2><p>• Download <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At6CC4x_yBnMdEszR2tMSXhQblhiX29UUGo5TFhkSVE&amp;usp=sharing\">the full spreadsheet</a><br />• Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@theguardian.com</a><br />• Follow us <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">on Twitter</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420109239|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|0139d480fb73e4580546e01ff7cb1e46fd2e2973 -->",

        "headline":"Why we need fairytales: Jeanette Winterson on Oscar Wilde",
        "body":"<p>\"Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God. It is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's day. And so&nbsp;a child could. But with me and such as I am it is different. One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long hours that follow … \"</p><p>– Oscar Wilde, \"De Profundis\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde\" title=\"\">Oscar Wilde</a> wrote \"De Profundis\" in Reading gaol where he was serving two years hard labour for being himself; he was homosexual. He was sent to prison in 1895 after one of the most notorious trials in English history. Wilde's fatal amour, Lord Alfred Douglas, was son of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/17/marquess-queensberry-linda-stratmann-review\" title=\"\">Marquess of Queensberry</a>, who was a bully, womaniser, gambling addict, cycling bore and amateur boxer (to him we owe the Queensberry rules). In his personal life there was no such thing as fair play. Queensberry was a vicious pugilist detested by his family. A caricature of masculinity, he loathed the cult of art and beauty that Wilde championed, and under the guise of saving his son from sodomy, he set about bringing down Wilde at the height of his fame.</p><p>The tragedy is that he succeeded. Wilde became the most infamous man in Britain. Queensberry bankrupted him. Even his copyrights and his library were sold. On release in 1897 he&nbsp;was forced to live abroad, separated permanently from his wife and children, who changed their name. Three years later he was dead.</p><p>Wilde loved his sons and had been a&nbsp;devoted father. He loved his wife, Constance Holland, too; in his domestic affairs, and perhaps only there, Wilde was unexpectedly conventional. He liked women, but in common with Victorian men of his class, heterosexual and homosexual alike, his interests and his excitements happened outside of the home – with other men.</p><p>Unlike other men, Wilde was flamboyant, outspoken and provocative. The all-male environments of school, university, the army, gentlemen's clubs and public life operated on a tacit code of concealment – whether of mistresses or misdemeanours. The \"love that dare not speak its name\" was a crime, yet in the eyes of society, Wilde's real crime was being found out. The Victorians didn't invent hypocrisy, but in an era of industrious taxonomy, they were the first to reclassify that sin as a virtue.</p><p>Disgraced and imprisoned, sleeping on a plank bed, his health broken, Wilde wrote a long letter to Alfred Douglas, later published as \"De Profundis\". It is&nbsp;a meditation on faith and fate, suffering and forgiveness, love and art. The strange thing is that in this, his last real piece of work, Wilde takes us back in tone and spirit to his first authentic work – the fairy stories or children's stories he wrote immediately after the birth of his two boys, Cyril and Vyvyan.</p><p>The work Wilde is remembered for was written over a period of less than 10 years. <em>The&nbsp;Happy Prince and Other Tales</em> was published in 1888. That volume marks the beginning of Wilde's true creativity. He had lectured extensively in the US – but that would not have won him any lasting legacy, any more than his journalism or his poems. He had published a great many poems, but Wilde was a bad poet – he rarely found the right words and he was old-fashioned. Read him next to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/emilydickinson\" title=\"\">Emily Dickinson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/walt-whitman\" title=\"\">Walt Whitman</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/wbyeats\" title=\"\">WB&nbsp;Yeats</a>, and you will see for yourself. We don't read his poetry now – it is dated and dead; too much Arcady and Hellenic Hours. The early plays suffer from the same verbal excess. Wilde at his worst wrote in purple. At his best he is dazzling.</p><p>The birth of his children seems to have regenerated Wilde as a writer. The tedious Hellenism vanished. The purple-isms faded. There are still overwritten images – Dawn's grey fingers clutching at the stars – and he never gives up his fondness for a biblical moment, usually appearing as precious stones or pronouns (thee and thy), but his style did change. The writing became freer and sharper, and also more self-reflective, without being self-absorbed.</p><p>Academic criticism of Wilde's work has too often dismissed these fairy stories as a minor bit of sentimentalism scribbled off by an iconoclast during a temporary bout of babymania. But since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jkrowling\" title=\"\">JK Rowling</a>'s Harry Potter and Philip Pullman's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philippullman\" title=\"\">His Dark Materials</a>, children's literature has been repositioned as central, not peripheral, shifting what children read, what we write about what children read, and what we&nbsp;read as adults. At last we seem to understand that imagination is ageless. Wilde's children's stories are splendid. In addition, it seems to me that they should be revisited as a defining part of&nbsp;his creative process.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420245865'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/14/1381770207982/the-Happy-Prince-illustra-001.jpg' alt='the Happy Prince illustration' width='460' height='604' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The fate of the Happy Prince echoes Wilde's own reversal of fortune from fame and money to destitution and exile.   Illustration: Grahame Baker-Smith</figcaption></figure><p>\"The Happy Prince\" starts a new note in Wilde's writing: loss. Emotions as poses are a distinctive feature of Wilde's work (\"I can sympathise with everything except suffering\"), and the&nbsp;poems had their fair share of lamentation, but from now on, loss is&nbsp;not a pose; it is real.</p><p>Fairytales always involve reversals of fortune. This works in both directions: beggars become kings, palaces collapse into hovels, the spoilt son eats thistles. Wilde's own reversal of fortune from fame and money to destitution and exile shares the same rapid drama. Fairytales are also and always about transformation of various kinds – frogs into princes, coal into gold – and if they are not excessively moralistic, there is usually a happy ending. Wilde's fairytale transformations turn on loss. Even \"The Star-Child\", in which meanness and vanity are overcome by&nbsp;compassion, ends with a kingdom that lasts only three years.</p><p>Wilde had a streak of prophecy in him. The children's stories can be read as notes from the future about Wilde's fate. It is as though the little child in him was trying to warn him of the dangers his adult self would soon face. \"Every single work of art is the fulfilment of a prophecy\", he writes in \"De Profundis\".</p><p>\"The Happy Prince\" is the story of a gilded and jewelled statue on a pedestal high above the town. One day, a Swallow late-flying to Egypt, after an unsatisfactory dalliance with a reed (\"She has no conversation\"), rests at the feet of the Happy Prince, who tells him of all the suffering he can see. He asks the Swallow to take the ruby from his sword and give it to a poor family. The Swallow does so. The Prince begs him to stay and to strip him bit by bit of all his gold and jewels to distribute to others. The weather is getting colder and the Swallow knows he should fly to the sun. But as he takes the Prince's jewelled eyes, he realises that he must stay, for now the Prince is&nbsp;blind. This is&nbsp;a lovely echo of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/01/king-lear-review\" title=\"\"><em>King Lear</em></a><em>,</em> when the blinded Gloucester is not abandoned by his son Edgar – just as Cordelia never abandons the love-blind Lear.</p><p>Winter comes. The Swallow dies at the feet of the Happy Prince, no longer sparkling with jewels and gold. The Mayor has the statue pulled down – proposing one of himself in its place. As the workmen melt down the Prince they find they cannot melt his heart. They throw it on the rubbish heap next to the body of a swallow.</p><p>I don't think anything could be closer in description than this to the rubbishing of Wilde and his genius by a society obsessed by appearances and indifferent to imagination. The soul is often described as a bird – and if Wilde is the Happy Prince, then the Swallow is his soul, that returns to him and will not leave him. The Reed, shallow-rooted, flirtatious, blown about by every wind, is certainly Douglas.</p><p>Wilde believed in the soul. He played with ideas of the separation of self and soul. This is the pivot of his chilling story <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, but he explored this sinister theme for the first time in his fairy story \"The Fisherman and his Soul\". A young man wants to be rid of his Soul so that he can marry a Mermaid. He gets a magic knife from a witch and cuts away his Soul. But his Soul returns to him once a year seeking reconciliation. The story ends in death, but not in tragedy – at least not in Wilde's worldview, where Love is the supreme value. And it is Love that asks for the supreme sacrifice.</p><p>In \"The Nightingale and the Rose\", a&nbsp;Nightingale colours a white rose red with her own heart's blood so that a&nbsp;poor student will have the most beautiful flower in the world to give to&nbsp;his beloved. His beloved rejects him and his rose, and the rose is thrown in the gutter, where it is broken by a cart-wheel. As Wilde says to Douglas in \"De Profundis\": \"Having got hold of my life you didn't know what to do with it … and so you broke it.\"</p><p>Indifference to gift and sacrifice is a&nbsp;theme of these fairy stories. In \"The Birthday of the Infanta\", the haughty princess humiliates the Dwarf who loves her. In \"The Devoted Friend\", a&nbsp;selfish Miller befriends Little Hans, a&nbsp;simple soul who tends his garden. The Miller likes making speeches about friendship, and never tires of telling Little Hans that the fruit and flowers he&nbsp;takes from the garden every day are only tokens of friendship. \"At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.\" The Miller never gives anything in return, and when he has taken all there is, and Little Hans is dead of cold, hunger and exhaustion, the Miller thinks how selfish it is of Little Hans to die – not the kind of thing a friend would do at all.</p><p>When Wilde was out of prison and living on £3 a week, Douglas, who had sponged off Wilde for years, inherited £20,000. He refused to settle any money on Wilde. It was the painter Whistler, though, who was the model for the selfish Miller. Whistler was a sarcastic, self-interested friend whom Wilde ridiculed in his story \"The Remarkable Rocket\". In this tale about a batch of fireworks destined for a royal wedding, the Rocket assumes he is the&nbsp;star of the show: \"The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else.\" Whistler was uncomfortable with Wilde's success and gradually became more vicious towards him. As Queensberry closed in, Whistler abandoned Wilde. Later, when Wilde was released and struggling to write, Whistler suggested he try writing \"The&nbsp;Bugger's Opera\". But as Wilde noted, Whistler always spelt Art with a&nbsp;capital I.</p><p>Wilde had a lifelong interest in Catholicism, although he was only baptised on his deathbed. He had a theory that Christ was the perfect example of what an artist should be – a&nbsp;true individual, a political and social radical, someone who enjoyed the company of the poor and the outcast –&nbsp;as Wilde did. Someone who could forgive and in whom love was transfigured as imagination. What is the resurrection if not the triumph of imagination over experience? His most overtly religious story is \"The Selfish Giant\". In a world that&nbsp;is&nbsp;always winter, long before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/10/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe\" title=\"\">CS&nbsp;Lewis</a>&nbsp;created Narnia, Wilde's Giant is both fairytale giant and Victorian industrialist. Wilde hated the hoarding and excesses of his epoch's materialism – not because he was a socialist, but because his whole endeavour, his cult of art and beauty, was a fight against the coarsening of the soul.</p><p>When the Giant builds a wall around what is \"his\" and drives the children away, he drives away the springtime, too. His only friends are hail and snow and bitter wind. Then one day, by a miraculous intervention, unsought and&nbsp;undeserved, the children creep back through a hole in the wall, led by&nbsp;the most mysterious child of all, whom the Giant comes to love. It is this Christ-child who returns for the Giant as he dies, covering his body in white blossom – the living opposite of the snow that had for so long covered the garden. The little child is wounded in the hands and feet when he returns – but in answer to the Giant's cries of outrage and revenge, the child explains that they are \"the wounds of love\".</p><p>In <em>An Ideal Husband</em>, Lord Goring tells the devoted but puritan Lady Chiltern, \"I have sometimes thought that perhaps you are a little hard in some of your views on life … It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.\"</p><p>And so when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> says in all seriousness, \"so many of the stories I read allowed the possibility of&nbsp;frogs turning into princes; whether that has a sort of insidious effect on rationality, I'm not sure,\" we know he has made a category error.</p><p>Reason and logic are tools for understanding the world. We need a means of understanding ourselves, too. That is what imagination allows. When a child reads of a Nightingale who bleeds her song into a rose for love's sake, or of a Selfish Giant who&nbsp;puts a wall round life, or of a Fisherman who wants to be rid of his Soul, or of a statue who feels the suffering of the world more keenly than the Mathematics Master who scoffs at his pupils for dreaming about Angels, the child knows at once both the mystery and truth of such stories. We have all at some point in our lives been the overlooked idiot who finds a way to kill the dragon, win the treasure, marry the princess.</p><p>As explanations of the world, fairy stories tell us what science and philosophy cannot and need not. There&nbsp;are different ways of knowing. \"Bring me the two most precious things in the city,\" said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.foliosociety.com/book/SGT/selfish-giant\" title=\"\"><em>• The Selfish Giant and Other Stories</em></a><em> by Oscar Wilde is published by the Folio Society for £24.95. </em></p><p>• This article was amended on 17 October 2013.

        "body":"<p>It's important for people to tell you what side they are on and why, and whether they might be biased. A declaration of members' interests, of a sort. So, I am going to be talking to you about reading. I'm going to tell you that libraries are important. I'm going to suggest that reading fiction, that reading for pleasure, is one of the most important things one can do. I'm going to make an impassioned plea for people to understand what libraries and librarians are, and to preserve both of these things.</p><p>And I am biased, obviously and enormously: I'm an author, often an author of fiction. I write for children and for adults. For about 30 years I have been earning  my living though my words, mostly by making things up and writing them down. It is obviously in my interest for people to read, for them to read fiction, for libraries and librarians to exist and help foster a love of reading and places in which reading can occur.</p><p>So I'm biased as a writer. But I am much, much more biased as a reader. And I am even more biased as a British citizen.</p><p>And I'm here giving this talk tonight, under the auspices of the Reading Agency: a charity whose mission is to give everyone an equal chance in life by helping people become confident and enthusiastic readers. Which supports literacy programs, and libraries and individuals and nakedly and wantonly encourages the act of reading. Because, they tell us, everything changes when we read.</p><p>And it's that change, and that act of reading that I'm here to talk about tonight. I want to talk about what reading does. What it's good for.</p><p>I was once in New York, and I listened to a talk about the building of private prisons – a huge growth industry in America. The prison industry needs to plan its future growth – how many cells are they going to need? How many prisoners are there going to be, 15 years from now? And they found they could  predict it very easily, using a pretty simple algorithm, based on asking what percentage of 10 and 11-year-olds couldn't read. And certainly couldn't read for pleasure.</p><p>It's not one to one: you can't say that a literate society has no criminality. But there are very real correlations.</p><p>And I think some of those correlations, the simplest, come from something very simple. Literate people read fiction.</p><p>Fiction has two uses. Firstly, it's a gateway drug to reading. The drive to know what happens next, to want to turn the page, the need to keep going, even if it's hard, because someone's in trouble and you have to know how it's all going to end … that's a very real drive. And it forces you to learn new words, to think new thoughts, to keep going. To discover that reading per se is pleasurable. Once you learn that, you're on the road to reading everything. And reading is key. There were noises made briefly, a few years ago, about the idea that we were living in a post-literate world, in which the ability to make sense out of written words was somehow redundant, but those days are gone: words are more important than they ever were: we navigate the world with words, and as the world slips onto the web, we need to follow, to communicate and to comprehend what we are reading. People who cannot understand each other cannot exchange ideas, cannot communicate, and translation programs only go so far.</p><p>The simplest way to make sure that we raise literate children is to teach them to read, and to show them that reading is a pleasurable activity. And that means, at its simplest, finding books that they enjoy, giving them access to those books, and letting them read them.</p><p>I don't think there is such a thing as a bad book for children. Every now and again it becomes fashionable among some adults to point at a subset of children's books, a genre, perhaps, or an author, and to declare them bad books, books that children should be stopped from reading. I've seen it happen over and over; Enid Blyton was declared a bad author, so was RL Stine, so were dozens of others. Comics have been decried as fostering illiteracy.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122796'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/7/2/1341223882512/Enid-Blytons-Famous-Five--002.jpg' alt='Enid Blyton's Famous Five book Five Get Into a Fix' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>No such thing as a bad writer... Enid Blyton's Famous Five. Photograph: Greg Balfour Evans/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p><br />It's tosh. It's snobbery and it's foolishness. There are no bad authors for children, that children like and want to read and seek out,  because every child is different. They can find the stories they need to, and they bring themselves to stories. A hackneyed, worn-out idea isn't hackneyed and worn out to them. This is the first time the child has encountered it. Do not discourage children from reading because you feel they are reading the wrong thing. Fiction you do not like is a route to other books you may prefer. And not everyone has the same taste as you.</p><p>Well-meaning adults can easily destroy a child's love of reading: stop them reading what they enjoy, or give them worthy-but-dull books that you like, the 21st-century equivalents of Victorian \"improving\" literature. You'll wind up with a generation convinced that reading is uncool and worse, unpleasant.</p><p>We need our children to get onto the reading ladder: anything that they enjoy reading will move them up, rung by rung, into literacy. (Also, do not do what this author did when his 11-year-old daughter was into RL Stine, which is to go and get a copy of Stephen King's Carrie, saying if you liked those you'll love this! Holly read nothing but safe stories of settlers on prairies for the rest of her teenage years, and still glares at me when Stephen King's name is mentioned.)</p><p>And the second thing fiction does is to build empathy. When you watch TV or see a film, you are looking at things happening to other people. Prose fiction is something you build up from 26 letters and a handful of punctuation marks, and you, and you alone, using your imagination, create a world and people it and look out through other eyes. You get to feel things, visit places and worlds you would never otherwise know. You learn that everyone else out there is a me, as well. You're being someone else, and when you return to your own world, you're going to be slightly changed.</p><p>Empathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals.</p><p>You're also finding out something as you read vitally important for making your way in the world. And it's this:</p><p>The world doesn't have to be like this. Things can be different.</p><p>I was in China in 2007, at the first party-approved science fiction and fantasy convention in Chinese history. And at one point I took a top official aside and asked him Why? SF had been disapproved of for a long time. What had changed?</p><p>It's simple, he told me. The Chinese were brilliant at making things if other people brought them the plans. But they did not innovate and they did not invent. They did not imagine. So they sent a delegation to the US, to Apple, to Microsoft, to Google, and they asked the people there who were inventing the future about themselves. And they found that all of them had read science fiction when they were boys or girls.</p><p>Fiction can show you a different world. It can take you somewhere you've never been. Once you've visited other worlds, like those who ate fairy fruit, you can never be entirely content with the world that you grew up in. Discontent is a good thing: discontented people can modify and improve their worlds, leave them better, leave them different.</p><p>And while we're on the subject, I'd like to say a few words about escapism. I hear the term bandied about as if it's a bad thing. As if \"escapist\" fiction is a cheap opiate used by the muddled and the foolish and the deluded, and the only fiction that is worthy, for adults or for children, is mimetic fiction, mirroring the worst of the world the reader finds herself in.</p><p>If you were trapped in an impossible situation, in an unpleasant place, with people who meant you ill, and someone offered you a temporary escape, why wouldn't you take it? And escapist fiction is just that: fiction that opens a door, shows the sunlight outside, gives you a place to go where you are in control, are with people you want to be with(and books are real places, make no mistake about that); and more importantly, during your  escape, books can also give you knowledge about the world and your predicament, give you weapons, give you armour: real things you can take back into your prison. Skills and knowledge and tools you can use to escape for real.</p><p>As JRR Tolkien reminded us, the only people who inveigh against escape are jailers.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122797'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348135542541/Tolkiens-illustration-of--002.jpg' alt='Tolkien's illustration of Bilbo Baggins's home' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tolkien's illustration of Bilbo's home, Bag End.

And to give them nowhere to read those books. I was lucky. I had an excellent local library growing up. I had the kind of parents who could be persuaded to drop me off in the library on their way to work in summer holidays, and the kind of librarians who did not mind a small, unaccompanied boy heading back into the children's library every morning and  working his way through the card catalogue, looking for books with ghosts or magic or rockets in them, looking for vampires or detectives or witches or wonders. And when I had finished reading the children's' library I began on the adult books.</p><p>They were good librarians. They liked books and they liked the books being read. They taught me how to order books from other libraries on inter-library loans. They had no snobbery about anything I read. They just seemed to like that there was this wide-eyed little boy who loved to read, and would talk to me about the books I was reading, they would find me other books in a series, they would help. They treated me as another reader – nothing less or more – which meant they treated me with respect. I was not used to being treated with respect as an eight-year-old.</p><p>But libraries are about freedom. Freedom to read, freedom of ideas, freedom of communication. They are about education (which is not a process that finishes the day we leave school or university), about entertainment, about making safe spaces, and about access to information.</p><p>I worry that here in the 21st century people misunderstand what libraries are and the purpose of them. If you perceive a library as a shelf of books, it may seem antiquated or outdated in a world in which most, but not all, books in print exist digitally. But that is to miss the point fundamentally.</p><p>I think it has to do with nature of information. Information has value, and the right information has enormous value. For all of human history, we have lived in a time of information scarcity, and having the needed information was always important, and always worth something: when to plant crops, where to find things, maps and histories and stories – they were always good for a meal and company. Information was a valuable thing, and those who had it or could obtain it could charge for that service.</p><p>In the last few years, we've moved from an information-scarce economy to one driven by an information glut. According to Eric Schmidt of Google, every two days now the human race creates as much information as we did from the dawn of civilisation until 2003. That's about five exobytes of data a day, for those of you keeping score. The challenge becomes, not finding that scarce plant growing in the desert, but finding a specific plant growing in a jungle. We are going to need help navigating that information to find the thing we actually need.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420122798'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348848437515/A-boy-reading-in-his-scho-004.jpg' alt='A boy reading in his school library' width='140' height='130' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Photograph: Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Libraries are places that people go to for information. Books are only the tip of the information iceberg: they are there, and libraries can provide you freely and legally with books. More children are borrowing books from libraries than ever before – books of all kinds: paper and digital and audio. But libraries are also, for example, places that people, who may not have computers, who may not have internet connections, can go online without paying anything: hugely important when the way you find out about jobs,  apply for jobs or apply for benefits is increasingly migrating exclusively online.  Librarians can help these people navigate that world.</p><p>I do not believe that all books will or should migrate onto screens: as Douglas Adams once pointed out to me, more than 20 years before the Kindle turned up, a physical book is like a shark. Sharks are old: there were sharks in the ocean before the dinosaurs. And the reason there are still sharks around is that sharks are better at being sharks than anything else is. Physical books are tough, hard to destroy, bath-resistant, solar-operated,  feel good in your hand: they are good at being books, and there will always be a place for them. They belong in libraries, just as libraries have already become places you can go to get access to ebooks, and audiobooks and DVDs and web content.</p><p>A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world. It's a place with librarians in it. What the libraries of the future will be like is something we should be imagining now.</p><p>Literacy is more important than ever it was, in this world of text and email, a world of written information. We need to read and write, we need global citizens who can read comfortably, comprehend what they are reading, understand nuance, and make themselves understood.</p><p>Libraries really are the gates to the future. So it is unfortunate that, round the world, we observe local authorities seizing the opportunity to close libraries as an easy way to save money, without realising that they are stealing from the future to pay for today. They are closing the gates that should be open.</p><p>According to a recent study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, England is the \"only country where the oldest age group has higher proficiency in both literacy and numeracy than the youngest group, after other factors, such as gender, socio-economic backgrounds and type of occupations are taken into account\".</p><p>Or to put it another way, our children and our grandchildren are less literate and less numerate than we are. They are less able to navigate the world, to understand it to solve problems. They can be more easily lied to and misled, will be less able to change the world in which they find themselves, be less employable. All of these things. And as a country, England will fall behind other developed nations because it will lack a skilled workforce.</p><p>Books are the way that we communicate with the dead. The way that we learn lessons from those who are no longer with us, that humanity has built on itself, progressed, made knowledge incremental rather than something that has to be relearned, over and over. There are tales that are older than most countries, tales that have long outlasted the cultures and the buildings in which they were first told.</p><p>I think we have responsibilities to the future. Responsibilities and obligations to children, to the adults those children will become, to the world they will find themselves inhabiting. All of us – as readers, as writers, as citizens – have obligations. I thought I'd try and spell out some of these obligations here.</p><p>I believe we have an obligation to read for pleasure, in private and in public places. If we read for pleasure, if others see us reading, then we learn, we exercise our imaginations. We show others that reading is a good thing.</p><p>We have an obligation to support libraries. To use libraries, to encourage others to use libraries, to protest the closure of libraries. If you do not value libraries then you do not value information or culture or wisdom. You are silencing the voices of the past and you are damaging the future.</p><p>We have an obligation to read aloud to our children. To read them things they enjoy. To read to them stories we are already tired of. To do the voices, to make it interesting, and not to stop reading to them just because they learn to read to themselves. Use reading-aloud time as bonding time, as time when no phones are being checked, when the distractions of the world are put aside.</p><p>We have an obligation to use the language. To push ourselves: to find out what words mean and how to deploy them, to communicate clearly, to say what we mean.  We must not to attempt to freeze language, or to pretend it is a dead thing that must be revered, but we should use it as a living thing, that flows, that borrows words, that allows meanings and pronunciations to change with time.</p><p>We writers  – and especially writers for children, but all writers –  have an obligation to our readers: it's the obligation to write true things, especially important when we are creating tales of people who do not exist in places that never were – to understand that truth is not in what happens but what it tells us about who we are. Fiction is the lie that tells the truth, after all. We have an obligation not to bore our readers, but to make them need to turn the pages. One of the best cures for a reluctant reader, after all, is a tale they cannot stop themselves from reading. And while we must tell our readers true things and give them weapons and give them armour and pass on whatever wisdom we have gleaned from our short stay on this green world, we have an obligation not to preach, not to lecture, not to force predigested morals and messages down our readers' throats like adult birds feeding their babies pre-masticated maggots; and we have an obligation never, ever, under any circumstances, to write anything for children that we would not want to read ourselves.</p><p>We have an obligation to understand and to acknowledge that as writers for children we are doing important work, because if we mess it up and write dull books that turn children away from reading and from books, we 've lessened our own future and diminished theirs.</p><p>We all – adults and children, writers and readers – have an obligation to daydream. We have an obligation to imagine. It is easy to pretend that nobody can change anything, that we are in a world in which society is huge and the individual is less than nothing: an atom in a wall, a grain of rice in a rice field. But the truth is, individuals change their world over and over, individuals make the future, and they do it by imagining that things can be different.</p><p>Look around you: I mean it. Pause, for a moment and look around the room that you are in. I'm going to point out something so obvious that it tends to be forgotten. It's this: that everything you can see, including the walls, was, at some point, imagined. Someone decided it was easier to sit on a chair than on the ground and imagined the chair. Someone had to imagine a way that I could talk to you in London right now without us all getting rained on.This room and the things in it, and all the other things in this building, this city, exist because, over and over and over, people imagined things.</p><p>We have an obligation to make things beautiful. Not to leave the world uglier than we found it, not to empty the oceans, not to leave our problems for the next generation. We have an obligation to clean up after ourselves, and not leave our children with a world we've shortsightedly messed up, shortchanged, and crippled.</p><p>We have an obligation to tell our politicians what we want, to vote against politicians of whatever party who do not understand the value of reading in creating worthwhile citizens, who do not want to act to preserve and protect knowledge and encourage literacy. This is not a matter of party politics. This is a matter of common humanity.</p><p>Albert Einstein was asked once how we could make our children intelligent. His reply was both simple and wise. \"If you want your children to be intelligent,\" he said, \"read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.\" He understood the value of reading, and of imagining. I hope we can give our children a world in which they will read, and be read to, and imagine, and understand.</p><p>• This is an edited version of Neil Gaiman's lecture for <a href=\"http://readingagency.org.uk\" title=\"\">the Reading Agency</a>, delivered on Monday October 14  at the Barbican in London.

        "headline":"Murders in the Rue Morgue: there'd have been no Sherlock Holmes without detective Dupin",
        "body":"<p>According to the introduction in my copy of the Everyman's edition of Edgar Allan Poe's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007420223\" title=\"\">Tales of Mystery and Imagination</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ts-eliot\" title=\"\">TS Eliot</a> said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edgarallanpoe\" title=\"\">Poe</a>'s writing was \"slipshod\", while Mark Twain found him \"unreadable\". And the reliably snooty <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/henryjames\" title=\"\">Henry James</a> wrote: \"To take [Poe] with more than a certain degree of seriousness is to lack seriousness one's self. An enthusiasm for Poe is the mark of a decidedly primitive stage of reflection.\"</p><p>After rereading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/05/classics-corner-edgar-allan-poe\">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>, I understand  these criticisms. I can especially see why TS Eliot might describe the prose as \"slipshod\". The sentences are frequently tangled and the dialogue, well, it's like this:</p><blockquote><p>\"Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for 15 minutes at least. All at one Dupin broke forth with these words: 'He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Théâtre des Variétés.'<br />'There can be no doubt of that,' I replied unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterwards I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.<br />'Dupin,' said I gravely, 'this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know I was thinking of ____?'\"</p></blockquote><p>The technical term for such exchanges is \"silly\". The trail of deduction Dupin next outlines is dafter still, and it's one he claims enabled him to work out what his companion was thinking. Does it really seem likely that someone would think of \"stereotomy\" when stepping on a crack on the pavement, and from there go to Epicurus's atoms and then right to the constellation Orion? Does it also seem likely that someone else would understand and follow this train of thought simply by watching the person? And that's before we get to the meat of the story (look away now if you don't want to spoil the extremely surprising ending): a mystery set in motion when an orangutan goes on the rampage, cuts off an old woman's head with a razor and throttles and then stuffs her daughter up a chimney – at which point one can't help but make a joke about Henry James describing Poe's writing as \"primitive\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420132716'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2013/10/16/1381918999319/Sherlock---Series-2-009.jpg' alt='Sherlock - Series 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The birth of a genre … would we have had a Holmes and Dr Watson without the detective Dupin? Photograph: Colin Hutton</figcaption></figure><p>While it's easy to pick holes in The Murders in the Rue Morgue, it's easier still to enjoy and admire it. Once I'd made it past the opening, and Poe's decidedly wacky theory that draughts provide a better test of \"the higher powers of the reflective intellect\" than chess, I was hooked. Perhaps we've gone slightly off the theme of this Halloween instalment of the Reading Group by tackling one of Poe's detective stories, but the gory details were among the things that most impressed me. How to resist a newspaper report that starts with the information: \"The inhabitants of Quartier St Roch were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks\"? Who wouldn't shudder upon reading: \"On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have been pulled up by the roots\"? By the roots! Later, we learn that these roots were \"clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp\". The poor murdered woman, meanwhile, was found with a face that was \"fearfully discoloured, and the eyeballs protruded. The tongue had been partially bitten through ... \"</p><p>This is strong stuff. Especially because, at this stage, we aren't aware that the killings have been carried out not by a singularly brutal man but by a rampaging monkey. That the story hinges on this beast may seem absurd, but it is splendidly presented. I loved how the whole story depends on the ape picking up his master's razor because he wished to emulate him, and have a shave. Such glorious, hideous absurdity. And while I might have doubted Dupin's deductive powers, the way he solves the story's conundrum of the sealed room and works out that the orangutan's master was a sailor from a Maltese vessel is exhilarating and brilliant.</p><p>Of course, the most exciting thing about this story is witnessing a new genre spring fully formed into the world. There may well have been detective stories without Dupin and his continually astounded companion, but there would definitely not have been any Holmes and Watson. The duo are so like Conan Doyle's in their attitude towards each other, in their manner of speaking and in how they solve problems together that reading the word \"Dupin\" in the text becomes a stumbling point. Isn't this Holmes speaking? Why does he utter a French tag instead of retreating to Baker Street? Conan Doyle's debt to Poe is hard to estimate – as is our own. The Murders in the Rue Morgue has changed the face of popular culture, and is essential reading for that reason alone. For inventing such a fully realised detective before the word \"detective\" even existed,  it's tempting to label Poe a genius. Or does that take things too far?

We in the museum decided this is not good. The museum wants to be more open to people, particularly young people, to help Tolstoy's heritage. We decided to make it really easy to use – compatible with iPad, e-reader, Kindle.\"</p><p>ABBYY FineReader provided the technology, but the cost of proofreading the texts in ebook format threatened to halt the project. Instead, readers from 49 countries – including Russia, the US, Germany, New Zealand, Peru and Thailand – came forward to help transcribe and proofread the works. The volunteers, spanning professions from engineers and IT professionals to doctors, teachers, geologists and linguists, signed up at <a href=\"http://www.readingtolstoy.ru/\" title=\"\">www.readingtolstoy.ru</a>, and galloped through 46,000 pages in just two weeks.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.rsl.ru/en\" title=\"\">Russian State Library</a> had already scanned Tolstoy's 90-volume collected works, but they are not available as ebook downloads, and other writings such as rare stories and letters have not been digitised before. In the UK, English language ebook versions of classics such as War and Peace are sold at low prices, but as yet are not readily available free of charge. The works will in the future be downloadable from the website, <a href=\"http://tolstoy.ru/\" title=\"\">http://tolstoy.ru</a> (an English-language version is under construction).</p><p>\"At the end of his life, Tolstoy said: 'I don't need any money for my work. I want to give my work to the people,' \" said Tolstaya. \"It was important for us to make it free for everyone. It is his will.\"</p><p>Thekla Thick, the writer's great-great-granddaughter and project manager at the Tolstoy Museum, said: \"We certainly hoped that in our country there would be a few hundred people who are ready to help us. But no one expected that in the first 10 days, thousands of volunteers would read 90 volumes.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420155314|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|a507a261f576bdfcc4f22ee4cd1f2a22fb59f906 -->",

        "body":"<p>Nazi Germany loved movies, and their leader was, as in so much else, fanatical about them. In his private cinema at the Reich Chancellery Hitler watched a movie every night, then gave his invited guests the benefit of his opinion on it. He loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/28/laurel-hardy-slapstick\" title=\"\">Laurel and Hardy</a>, for instance, noting how their comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvxEytUO1pU\" title=\"\"><em>Block-Heads</em></a> contained \"a lot of very nice ideas and clever jokes\". Yet he regarded movies as something more than entertainment; he saw in their power to seduce and bewitch a&nbsp;vital instrument of persuasion. His propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, saw it, too. After watching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/28/it-happened-one-night-film-review\" title=\"\"><em>It Happened One Night</em></a>, he wrote in his diary: \"A funny, lively American film from which we can learn a lot. The Americans are so natural. Far superior to us.\"</p><p>If this eye-opening study of Hollywood and the Nazi elite is to be believed, that superiority was purely a technical one. <em>The Collaboration</em> unfolds a story that rather knocks the shine off the golden age of cinema. Ben Urwand argues that once Hitler ascended to power in 1933 the major Hollywood studios tacitly agreed not to portray Germany in an unfavourable light or to&nbsp;mention its persecution of the Jews. On occasion they went to extraordinary lengths to suppress any mention of the word \"Jew\" at all. Urwand has done some energetic digging in the archives, quoting letters, memos and newspaper reports to uncover a shameful policy of compromise and kowtowing on the part of the studio bosses. And what lends the story its peculiar irony is that those bosses who did their utmost to appease the crazed ideology of Nazism were by and large Jews themselves.</p><p>The story properly begins in December 1930 when the film of Erich Maria Remarque's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/nov/03/1\" title=\"\"><em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em></a> provoked rioting in a Berlin cinema. Remarque's anti-war message and its supposedly unpatriotic picture of German soldiery had outraged the Nazi faithful, who broke up the screening, threw stink bombs and released white mice into the crowd. Six days later the chief censor Ernst Seeger banned the film on&nbsp;the grounds that it harmed the national image. Universal Pictures, which had made the film, agreed to significant cuts in its release elsewhere. Two years later a&nbsp;law was passed regulating worldwide distribution of any film considered anti-German; Hollywood studios saw the writing on the wall – conform, or lose the profits emanating from the German market. Their decision does not seem to have been one they agonised over.</p><p>After 1933 the Nazis' editorial stranglehold was tightened by the appointment of their very own watchdog in Los Angeles. This was a&nbsp;former diplomat, Georg Gyssling. (I&nbsp;winced every time I read that name, tainting by its closeness the innocence of my favourite English novelist.) His job was&nbsp;to vet, and thence to veto, any film coming out of Hollywood that might be detrimental to \"German prestige\". One such was a script written by Herman J Mankiewicz (later to write <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/76006/citizen.kane\" title=\"\"><em>Citizen Kane</em></a>) entitled <em>The Mad Dog of Europe</em>, a story explicitly about the destruction of a Jewish family in Hitler's Germany. Since the film was not attached to any studio, Gyssling applied to the Hays Office, whose Production Code seal was vital to a film's US distribution. Hays's LA censor, a sinister figure named Joseph Breen, composed this memo: \"Because of the large number of Jews active in the motion picture industry in this country, the charge is certain to be made that the Jews, as a class, are behind an anti-Hitler picture and using the entertainment screen for their own personal propaganda purposes. The entire industry, because of this, is likely to be&nbsp;indicted for the action of a&nbsp;mere handful.\" This warning, bizarrely argued, was nevertheless heeded: <em>The&nbsp;Mad Dog of Europe</em> was abandoned, and it marked a turning point in the collaboration. Studios henceforth would avoid Jewish subjects lest they provoked an anti-Jewish reaction in the US. A vested interest could now masquerade as a moral principle.</p><p>Urwand sharpens his indictment with remorseless intent, if not with any detectable sense of humour. The subject is a deeply serious one, of course – an entire industry is in the dock, with good reason – but the po-faced absurdity of the Nazis' ideological rationale would at times make a cat laugh. There is, for instance, something wildly comical in a regime that gives a pass to <em>King Kong</em> but bans <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan_the_Ape_Man_%281932_film%29\" title=\"\"><em>Tarzan the Ape Man</em></a> – \"a film … that tends to imply that a jungle man, virtually an ape, is capable of the noblest impulses of the soul and is a worthy marriage partner, certainly runs against the tendencies of National Socialism with regard to population politics\". And the ironies start to multiply when a film such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_%281932_film%29\" title=\"\"><em>Scarface</em></a> was banned as a threat to civil order – a&nbsp;gangster picture outlawed by a&nbsp;gangster state. Urwand, who is a&nbsp;junior fellow at Harvard, remains rather beetle-browed.</p><p>A mixture of German expediency and American pusillanimity maintained the collaboration between 1933 and 1939. The Nazis, unwilling to have themselves cast as villains in the world's most popular form of entertainment, kept a watchful eye on the Hollywood production line. The studios, protective of their business interests, continued to trim their sails accordingly, aware that Gyssling and Breen were lurking in the shadows, ready to be offended. One of the most infamous episodes related here concerns the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Can%27t_Happen_Here\" title=\"\">Sinclair Lewis novel <em>It Can't Happen Here</em></a>, the tale of an ambitious senator who steals the 1936 presidential nomination to become \"the Chief\" – in other words, America's first dictator. MGM purchased the screen rights and hired a talented screenwriter, Sidney Howard, to adapt it. Breen, having read the script, snapped into action, writing a seven-page letter urging Louis B Mayer not to make the film, which he considered \"dangerous\" and&nbsp;\"inflammatory\". Mayer, enthused by the idea of Hollywood's first major anti-fascist picture, decided to push ahead anyway, and might have got his way had not the chair of the film committee of the Central Conference of American Rabbis got wind of the project. The latter wrote to Will Hays: \"The only wise method to pursue in these days of virulent antisemitism is to have no picture in which the Jewish Problem is ventilated.\" Hays got together with Mayer, and some days later MGM dropped <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>, on the grounds of \"casting difficulties\". A disgusted Sinclair Lewis rightly suspected otherwise: \"I&nbsp;wrote <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>, but I&nbsp;begin to think it certainly can.\"</p><p>Balancing this unsavoury roll call of appeasers and colluders, the story has a late-arriving hero: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht\" title=\"\">Ben Hecht</a>, Jewish screenwriter and activist, courageously strove to publicise the plight of Europe's Jews, helped to create the War Refugee Board, and delivered a savage verdict on his government's failure to intervene: \"The Roosevelt-Churchill attitude towards Jews will go down in history as part of [the Nazis'] extermination plan.\" But that's a different issue. This book's verdict on the studios has already caused conniptions among some US commentators. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/09/how-could-harvard-have-published-ben-urwands-the-collaboration.html\" title=\"\">New Yorker film critic David Denby has deplored Urwand's use of the term \"collaboration\"</a> as \"scholarly sensationalism\", and has taken Harvard University Press to task for publishing the book without proper \"fact-checking\". But some basic facts in Urwand's thesis look incontrovertible. The studio bosses could have stood up to the likes of Breen and Gyssling, but they didn't. They could have supported their own film-makers and helped alert movie-goers everywhere to a genocidal crime, but they didn't. They could have been <em>mensches</em>, but they acted like stooges.</p><p>• Anthony Quinn's novels include <em>The Streets</em> and <em>Half of the Human Race</em>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419924838|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|564ee535ea1dfb91fa876e0c72814a2eef0704e1 -->",

        "headline":"The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health and Disease by Daniel Lieberman – review",
        "body":"<p>The effect the modern western diet has had on our health and wellbeing has been a rumbling issue for decades; it has become more controversial recently thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/24/paleofantasy-evolution-sex-diet-review\" title=\"\">the influential evolutionary perspective on the subject</a>. When the organic food movement began, the premise was that traditional farming practices were the norm, from which we&nbsp;have departed by adopting intensive techniques to produce highly processed food. This could be dubbed the Prince Charles Line. But seen in the light of&nbsp;evolution, as Daniel Lieberman considers it, farming itself was the Great Unnatural Practice. At the extreme, the&nbsp;evolutionary perspective has given rise to the Paleo lifestyle, an attempt to return to the way we lived before the invention of farming 10,000 years ago: to live \"as evolution intended\".</p><p>Lieberman is far from endorsing such crass simplifications. Evolution, as he stresses, intends nothing. What&nbsp;actually evolves is due to many competing tendencies, and the result is&nbsp;always a work in progress with no destination. Notable figures including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/david-attenborough\" title=\"\">David Attenborough</a> and the geneticist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/stevejones\" title=\"\">Steve Jones</a> have remarked that human evolution has now ceased. Lieberman says this cannot be true: human beings continue to show a great degree of heritable variation, and reproductive success is also variable; so evolution of some kind must still be active. He goes further by regretting that for most of his career as a professor of human evolutionary biology he taught the old&nbsp;line that human biology has hardly changed since the Ice Age.</p><p>The question is: if human evolution is ongoing, what factors are influencing it now, as opposed to in the distant past? Genomic studies show that more&nbsp;than 100 genes indicate positive selection since farming began 10,000 years ago. Beyond the best-known example – the lactose tolerance gene, which has gone from almost zero to nearly 100% in northern Europe – most&nbsp;of them have not yet been characterised, but many almost certainly relate to the infectious diseases that accompanied hugely expanded human populations living hugger-mugger with domestic animals.</p><p>Lieberman is good at explaining why simplistic nostrums aren't appropriate for considering creatures such as human beings. We are not designed specifically to do one thing, but to be adaptable to many. Thus dark skin protects against UV radiation in equatorial regions but is gradually lost in northern climates probably because the weaker sunlight found there would generate inadequate levels of vitamin D in heavily pigmented skin. The body is&nbsp;designed to be good enough to do many things, but not to be especially good at any one of them. It doesn't have a large margin of error, unlike engineered structures such as bridges and aeroplanes, designed to withstand several times the stresses they will actually experience. Thus specialised animals out-compete us in speed, strength and visual or aural acuity, which was a problem when humans lived more or less in a state of nature.</p><p>Essentially, Lieberman's message is that modern life has created mismatches between our abilities and adaptations and the stresses we place on the body by often living thousands of miles from our family's origins, sitting down all day long rather than actively gaining a livelihood by physical work, and snatching at quick, high-energy foods.</p><p>The evolutionary approach produces some counterintuitive surprises. Fresh fruit juices are as much junk food as a cola drink – they produce a sugar rush, so it's better to eat fresh fruit with its additional fibre; chewing gum as a child is a healthy pastime, if the gum is sugar-free (teeth and jaws need the exercise that modern diets fail to provide). Without going the whole Paleo wild boar, Lieberman suggests we can learn something from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. He is a celebrated advocate of&nbsp;barefoot running, for example.</p><p>Since his book is all about trade-offs between incompatible attributes, it is only right to point out that, while his message is sound, it could have been made at half the length. In discussing the human plague&nbsp;of obesity he seems unable to resist the textual bloat that is equally a&nbsp;trait of our times. But given the vast outpouring in recent years of crank diets and earnest attempts to correct western lifestyle ills by some kind of Rousseauist regression, <em>The Story of the Human Body</em> is a reliable guide to a&nbsp;problem that is going to get worse before it gets better.</p><p><em>• </em>Peter Forbes is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780300178968\" title=\"\"><em>Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage</em></a><em>.</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419929903|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|9967676dc85ad273c686392ab5716c0ad23c32e6 -->",

        "body":"<p>Years ago I asked a section editor on the paper for which I then worked whether he was going to employ a&nbsp;particular journalist. \"No, I won't,\"&nbsp;he&nbsp;replied, \"because he is an incompetent, lazy, stupid, arrogant plagiariser, who can't even write. And&nbsp;I&nbsp;speak as a friend of his.\"</p><p>Which is rather the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/aitken\" title=\"\">Jonathan Aitken</a> speaks of his friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/margaretthatcher\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a>. Here is just a selection of the words he uses to describe her – either deploying his own judgment or&nbsp;that of&nbsp;people he quotes: phoney, bullying, obnoxious, hypocritical, deplorable, unpleasant, alienating, opportunistic, confrontational, monomaniacal, disloyal, dysfunctional, snarky, pedestrian, hesitant, insufferably rude, foolish, arrogant, grudge-bearing and an&nbsp;anachronistic bigot.</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prior,_Baron_Prior\" title=\"\">Jim Prior</a> found her \"vindictive and nasty\"; others spoke of \"her tendency to fly off the handle too early, her capacity to get the wrong end of the stick and her reluctance to apologise\". She was \"the least collegiate politician I have ever met … this is because she has&nbsp;no friends\". Others accuse her of&nbsp;\"governessy hatred\", of being a \"stubborn Salome\" who \"liked to hog the limelight\". Tim Bell, her favourite adman, called her \"the old bat\", and <a href=\"http://commentisfree.theguardian.com/bernard_ingham/profile.html\" title=\"\">Bernard Ingham</a>, her loyal press secretary, said she was \"the most tactless woman I have ever met in my life\".</p><p>And Aitken speaks as a friend of hers. They got off to a bad start. He ended a three-year affair with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2013/apr/13/carol-thatcher-tribute-mother-video\" title=\"\">Carol Thatcher</a>, and her mother said bitterly: \"He made Carol cry.\" At a dinner party, shortly after she became Tory leader, he was asked about her Middle East policies, and said: \"She knows so little … she probably thinks Sinai is the plural of sinus.\" This reached <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/09/private-eye-adam-macqueen-review\" title=\"\">Private Eye</a>, and her factotum Airey Neave demanded Aitken make an apology in&nbsp;person, in the&nbsp;division lobby: \"She'll&nbsp;be wearing a&nbsp;green dress.\"</p><p>But he is, overall, a huge admirer. He&nbsp;believes she was sound and brave&nbsp;on most foreign affairs: the Falklands,&nbsp;the ending of the cold war, the liberation of Kuwait, and the euro (though he suggests that she rewrote history when declaring she was always against our membership of the ERM).</p><p>Her judgment was less reliable in domestic affairs. Aitken points out that she could not distinguish between the striking miners and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/arthur-scargill\" title=\"\">Arthur Scargill</a>, regarding them all as members of the enemy within. That contempt for the working-class people of the north and the Midlands brought a cost that the Conservative party is still paying. The&nbsp;poll tax: surely the product of a&nbsp;disordered mind? She began to treat the people closest to her with evident contempt, most of all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/geoffrey-howe\" title=\"\">Geoffrey Howe</a> who received a bollocking in cabinet that no schoolteacher would be allowed to administer today. When the&nbsp;\"stalking donkey\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jan/08/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Anthony Meyer</a>, stood against her in 1989, she had a&nbsp;good campaign team in place, but the&nbsp;whips warned her that on top of the handful of votes Meyer got, there were all the abstentions, spoiled ballots and dozens of MPs who had to&nbsp;be arm-twisted into supporting her. The situation was therefore far more dangerous than it appeared. She brushed their fears aside as the hobgoblins of lesser minds, and a year later insouciantly cleared off to Paris for a ceremonial summit, which she could easily have skipped. But she loved mingling with world leaders, and&nbsp;telling them where they were wrong. Meanwhile, she left behind as her campaign manager Peter&nbsp;Morrison, a lazy alcoholic, who believed all the fake pledges of support and spent much of the campaign asleep, drunk or both.</p><p>By the time of her defenestration, she had become the world's most powerful bag lady, of the type who harangue you at bus stops, and who are&nbsp;best ignored, except that you can't ignore the prime minister. You could call her, as a female King Lear, \"a very foolish fond old woman\", except there was little fond about her – apart from some engaging nonsenses. Just before the Falklands war ended in her greatest victory – which she won by ignoring or assailing almost all her own cabinet and a&nbsp;very substantial chunk of the Tory party in parliament, plus the president of the United States and his&nbsp;most senior officials – she could be&nbsp;found cooking the food at a children's party for the families of&nbsp;Downing Street staff. Admirable in&nbsp;some ways;&nbsp;barking in others.</p><p>By the end, however, she had slipped her moorings. Even one of her most devoted supporters, the right-wing MP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Budgen\" title=\"\">Nick Budgen</a> declared that she was \"off her rocker\". She retired (Aitken says her notorious \"I shall be a very good backseat driver\" remark was directed at George Bush rather than John Major) but devoted much of her life, like Ted Heath, to trashing her successor behind his back. We all need a hobby, and that was hers. (There's another good account of this in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/26/highereducation.politicalbooks3\" title=\"\">John Sergeant's book <em>Maggie</em></a>.)</p><p>The Fall of Thatcher could be staged, not least because hers was a very modern hubris. Having started out lacking in real confidence – her first cabinet was stuffed with grandees who opposed all that she stood for – she was brought down in the end by believing her own publicity. She adopted with wild enthusiasm the \"iron lady\" sobriquet coined by the USSR army newspaper, forgetting that everything in those Soviet rags was lies and propaganda. I recall a grandiloquent speech, after the fall, to American travel agents in Glasgow, who must have been puzzled to learn she had ended the cold war herself, with Ronald Reagan as Robin to her Batman. She could give solipsism a bad name.</p><p>The pleasure of Aitken's readable, even beguiling, book is in the anecdotes. He suspects that her breathtakingly arrogant attempt to&nbsp;stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/08/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Bernard Weatherill</a> from becoming&nbsp;Speaker – something she had absolutely no right to do – helped bring her down. He arranged that Howe's killer speech in 1990 would be heard when the chamber was full, and in complete silence, giving it maximum effect. She realised then that the end was near, but couldn't grasp even then her&nbsp;own contribution to the coming catastrophe, and chose to blame the cabinet instead – \"treachery with a&nbsp;smile on its face\".</p><p>Then there was the time she went to&nbsp;holiday on Islay: the host family's noisy offspring meant she was unable to sleep, so she went for a walk in a hooded coat. Mistaken by a security officer for a sinister intruder, she was pinned to the wet moorland by a slavering police dog. For some anti-Thatcherites, that story alone will be worth the price of the book.</p><p>One day we might reach a reasonable assessment of Thatcher, somewhere between the adulation and the loathing: she achieved a reasonable amount economically at home (while pitching us into the tooth-and-claw capitalism we suffer today), had some influence on the world stage, and in the last few years in power lost the plot. This book, by an alarmingly candid friend, will go a long way towards helping find&nbsp;that balance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420022360|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|6c0c5412dc305d7276e1843c42099bfe2655b095 -->",

        "body":"<p><em>Subtle Bodies</em> is the third novel by the American author Norman Rush, whose book <em>Mating</em> won the National Book award in 1991. The story concerns the reunion in middle age of a group of male university friends whose leading light, Douglas, has continued to mesmerise them in adulthood to the extent that they have all failed to grow up. Douglas, however, has died, having accidentally driven his ride-on mower over the edge of a&nbsp;ravine on his vast country estate. The&nbsp;men gather from their separate corners of the Earth at the scene, where, with Douglas's widow and teenage son, they attempt to organise a&nbsp;memorial service and to unravel the enigma of their friend, whose Evelyn Waugh-ish demise has left them with numerous mysteries to solve.</p><p>What proceeds might be described as the wrong kind of masterclass, for <em>Subtle Bodies</em> is a&nbsp;novel whose assumptions are so thoroughly back to front that it offers an oddly lucid account of its own shortcomings. What sets out to be a&nbsp;semi-satirical commentary on the nature of male friendships becomes a&nbsp;lost narrative with nothing at its heart, as though the author had pursued the subject only to discover that it was empty. &quot;There is no permanent friendship between men, among men,&quot; one of the characters observes. &quot;Something goes wrong, somebody marries the wrong person, somebody advances too fast, somebody converts, somebody refuses good advice or bad advice, it&nbsp;didn't matter. It went up in a flash.&quot;</p><p>In trying to capture this impermanence, Rush creates a lot of uphill work for reader and writer alike. <em>Subtle Bodies</em> is like a&nbsp;house that has been built in the&nbsp;wrong place: he has situated his narrative so that it stands counter to the elements, where things are made unnecessarily difficult and nothing he&nbsp;needs is to hand. None of his characters is in their customary physical or emotional environment; the person whose habitat they occupy is no longer there; the source of group connection is out of date and irrelevant; and the relentless approach of the memorial service is both stressful and lacking in any dividend for the reader, who never met Douglas, nor ever will, and has to be reminded at frequent intervals of his importance.</p><p>The narrative allies itself with Ned, a&nbsp;charity worker and&nbsp;political activist, and the member of the&nbsp;group least certain of Douglas's friendship and esteem; and also, increasingly, with Ned's wife Nina, who has pursued Ned&nbsp;all the way to Douglas's estate so that they can make love at the time most propitious to conception. This is&nbsp;an unpromising beginning for any female character, but it is also too obviously an excuse to import someone into the&nbsp;novel who can redress its structural problems.</p><p>As well as exemplifying the nurturing female qualities the boys' club lacks, Nina has to fill in the missing acres of backstory; explain the novel's land<sup></sup>scape, themes and characters; represent a general scepticism in the matter of Douglas and his domination of his friends; and, increasingly, to act as a yardstick of normality while remaining witty, beautiful, clever and&nbsp;kind. The result is&nbsp;that the novel becomes helplessly dependent on her: &quot;There was something she understood,&quot; she ruminates, watching Ned sleep, &quot;which was why Ned had felt so&nbsp;urgently the need to fly east. It had to do with power. It had to do with the old days … his escape to NYU and meeting Douglas and being included in the power group of friends. That had been his great escape, as he saw it … it was like a fable where some grail or amulet has been mislaid and needed to be gotten back by a hero going into a&nbsp;labyrinth or dark gorge the hero had already passed through once … She had a better idea of&nbsp;what he was doing than he did.&quot;</p><p>Rush is so frank in his signalling of his own themes that for a while the novel's lack of emotional maturity and authority – and indeed its dependency – seem to have been designed to echo the stuntedness of its actors, ageing men in the grip of college-era preoccupations. Yet the same frankness makes him incapable of disguising the fact that the novel's game is up: he&nbsp;goes on with it doggedly, dispensing with the more detailed writing of the first half to get the job done. What Rush is committed to here is the idea that men are nothing without women, that their social vision is deluded, their morality without substance, their credulity infinite: it is woman who makes life, order, continuity. Whatever the value of this idea, the novel fails to consummate it: had he dispensed with the commentating, order-making female perspective, and abandoned himself and us entirely to the brusqueness and inadequacy of the male relationships, the result might have been a harsher novel, but a better one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419575817|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|5e90745989bf44d8a63661ebb2827f3c49509fdf -->",

        "body":"<p>I like to fancy I know a little bit about the more obscure corners of the rock world. Did I not, after all, spend 20&nbsp;years listening to John Peel? Did I not sneer at and spurn the mainstream? I am now chastened. I know <em>nothing</em>. Or at least, nothing compared to Julian Cope, erstwhile frontman of the Teardrop Explodes, now writer, unofficial warden of the ancient sites of&nbsp;Britain, and, by his own admission, spaced-out freak. (And by my own earnest assertion, under-appreciated national treasure.)</p><p>Here is a book of umpteen reviews by Cope of umpteen bands, a book so&nbsp;thick that its spine alone can accommodate not only the book's title and author, Faber's logo and a drawing of the Cerne Abbas giant waving an electric guitar, but three quotes from reviews of the book itself (from Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream, Roddy Doyle and Q magazine). Of these umpteen bands, I&nbsp;had heard of about 11.</p><p>I thought it was 12 at first, but I was confusing Rocket from the Tombs with&nbsp;Rocket from the Crypt. However, dig deeper and you notice connections. Rocket from the Tombs was Crocus Behemoth's band before he founded Pere Ubu (a clue, before you even get to the text which explains this, is in the tracklist of their album <em>The World's Only Dumb-Metal, Mind‑Death Rock'n'Roll Band</em>, which&nbsp;includes \"30 Seconds Over Tokyo\", a&nbsp;song familiar to me from Pere Ubu's repertoire). Crocus Behemoth was, of course, once the stage name of David Thomas, and he&nbsp;and the rest of Pere Ubu, formed in 1975, performed at Shepherd's Bush Hall a&nbsp;few months ago. <em>Do</em>&nbsp;keep up.</p><p>The reason you want to read that is – apart, of course, from the idea you might learn something – because of Cope's prose. As far as I know, both the <em>Oxford Style Guide</em> and Faber's in-house manual do not explicitly rule out spelling \"was\" \"wuz\", but they don't rule it in, either. Cope uses that spelling when mentioning the band the&nbsp;Pretty Things, who, as Cope puts it, \"wuz Born Never Arsed a full decade too early\". (In other words, they were punks <em>avant la lettre,</em> and he's right.) The book is almost all written in an unapologetic, Lester Bangs mid-to-late stoned NME style, and it's no accident that the late-hippy adjective \"righteous\" not only comes up frequently, but is&nbsp;the first word of the book after its&nbsp;introduction. Sentences are long,&nbsp;quirky but controlled – and hugely&nbsp;informative. It is, in short, a&nbsp;celebration of the music Cope is himself celebrating: loud, irreverent, verging on the apparently mindless, but actually possessed of&nbsp;an&nbsp;underlying tight control and intelligence. In other words, just right.</p><p>My long research on YouTube has proved that he is not actually making these bands up, and has educated me in the byways and forgotten moments of rock history. Henry Flynt and the Insurrections, for instance, which consisted of Flynt and a friend on drums, made in 1966 the most rudimentary sound conceivable, his&nbsp;song \"Uncle Sam Do\" being both Fluxus-inspired exercise in audience alienation (it makes the Fugs sound like the Wombles) and protest song, the power of whose protest may have been vitiated by Flynt's refusal to release it beyond a tiny coterie until 2004. Even now, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uCzaPb06cg\" title=\"\">YouTube recording</a> of that song has fewer than 500 views; and, as&nbsp;Cope says, \"the difference between Henry Flynt and most other conceptual artists of his time is that the more you play \"I Don't Wanna\", the more you need to hear it.\"</p><p>The book is arranged chronologically, and near the beginning there is a&nbsp;touching story of Cope's early exposure&nbsp;to Tom Lehrer – his mother encouraging the metre-high Cope to&nbsp;learn his songs about necrophilia, incest and drug-dealing word-perfect and sing them to astonished house guests as a twisted party trick. Perhaps&nbsp;this sowed the seeds of his appreciation of bands who didn't give a&nbsp;flying one, and the very fact that this book is so enthusiastic about bands who didn't care is a beautiful, enriching irony.

        "headline":"My Name Is … by Alastair Campbell – review",
        "body":"<p>It was an ambitious and worthy idea, to&nbsp;tell the story of Hannah, a teenage alcoholic, from the perspective of the wider circle of characters affected by her drinking. The prospect of using 25 narrative voices would intimidate even&nbsp;the most sophisticated of writers. Not Campbell, though, who gets around it in two ways: by giving similar characters identical idiolects, or, when he's really going for it, dropping in a bit of French for a magistrate married to a man from Brittany. \"You must forgive my lapses into <em>le franglais</em>,\" she tells the reader, about as convincingly as Kishori, a London-born, second-generation Indian, cringingly claims to be \"more British than Her Maj\".</p><p>That there is passion and belief behind this project is obvious, but in some ways that is the problem. Having been affected by the issues of the novel&nbsp;himself, Campbell cares so much about hammering home his point that the reader feels as if they're being bludgeoned repeatedly with the message that alcoholism is a dangerous disease to which all are vulnerable. Indeed, one character explains to her husband, who claims not to understand Hannah's reliance on drinking while knocking back post-work gin and tonics himself, \"It's only a question of scale. You need your little rituals. She needs hers.\" This type of heavy handed exposition occurs repeatedly, with the narrators painstakingly detailing their relationship with the bottle, whether relevant to the story or not. \"As for drink, I am at a total loss to work it all out,\" says Hannah's sister in such an inelegant return to the novel's central theme that I actually groaned out loud.</p><p>Exasperating, too, is the baffling lack of dialogue and live action. Characters give accounts of events as witnesses might in a trial, presenting the reader with their tedious reports rather than allowing us to experience things first-hand. The custody battle between Hannah's parents, for instance, might have been compelling, had we been permitted to sit in court alongside the warring couple. Instead, we are given the key facts by Eric, the pedantic judge overseeing the case: \"[Pat] then went on to seek to refute Mrs Maynard's point that the possibility of future relationships with women meant he would not give his daughters sufficient attention when he saw them.\"</p><p>It's a shame that this energy-sapping technique is used so often, as when the reader is privy to actual dialogue, the novel comes alive – vividly so, in the case of Hannah. When she talks about a day-long bender with a friend's mum, it's utterly convincing, brilliantly capturing the teenager's love-hate relationship with alcohol, from the heady moments of the first drink when \"a bar that felt half empty suddenly feels a lot more than half full\", to the humiliation of wetting the friend's bed. Throughout, it's the teenagers that Campbell does best, another high-point being the narrative of Sammy, Hannah's first boyfriend. Their barbed but flirtatious exchanges give us a glimpse of&nbsp;the type of writer Campbell could be, were he not so bogged down by his mission to educate the world about worthy issues. This may be a commendable life‑aim, but it does not&nbsp;make&nbsp;for a commendable novel.</p><p>• Annabel Pitcher's <em>My Sister Lives on the Mantelpiece </em>is published by Indigo.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419899197|2013-10-17T12:52:58Z|dac874521bf2e9dc06d47b0e02e45b674d8e2bea -->",
