I didn\u2019t appreciate it when I was a kid: when you\u2019re brought up by the seaside, you never do. I spent a lot of my time swimming, fishing and playing golf, but I just took it all for granted. Then I moved to London, where I live now, and forgot all about the coast. Now I go down to Dorset about three times a month, to keep an eye on the business and have a bit of time out.
