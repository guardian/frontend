It is positive that the government has accepted Francis’ recommendation that patients should be put first, and that everything done by the NHS and everyone associated with it should be informed by this ethos. The only way to ensure that services meet the needs of both the individual and the community is by embedding the patient and community voice at every level of support and by listening and acting on it. Failure to do this means we will not see the impact of the welcome changes the Francis report calls for.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's all from us for today, we'll be back in the morning.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528b8b32e4b010b65d5561ab\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T16:18:33.193Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>Claire Burke writes</em></p> <p>Here are a couple more responses. <a href=\"http://www.rcm.org.uk/college/about/media-centre/press-releases/safety-staffing-openness-and-transparency-should-be-at-the-heart-of-the-nhs-say-midwives-19-11-13/\">Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall this is a robust and comprehensive response by the government. Safety, staffing and openness and transparency should be at the heart of the NHS. If the government really follow up their commitments in this response then I hope we will see an even safer and better NHS and, a maternity service that has the right number of staff, with the right skills.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sue Rees, chair of council at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The emphasis on creating the right structures and systems to enable staff to perform at their best is greatly welcomed. However, given the ever increasing demand for NHS services, the CSP is concerned about how far the government’s good intentions will succeed in improving services unless safe staffing levels are funded and guaranteed. Physiotherapists tell us they need a system that’s properly resourced, where staff are well trained, given the chance to develop their skills and practice and allowed to work to priorities that put patients first at all times.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Mary Agnew, deputy director of the Francis Implementation Team at the Department of Health, r<a href=\"https://maryagnew.blog.gov.uk/2013/11/19/reponse/\">eflects on the government response to the Francis inquiry.</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528b8527e4b010b65d5561a2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T15:42:28.734Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>Helen Crane writes</em></p> <p>Marie Curie Cancer Care has made an interesting point <a href=\"http://www.mariecurie.org.uk/en-GB/press-media/news-comment/Francis-Report-must-lead-to-improved-care-for-people-nearing-the-end-of-their-lives/?amp;epslanguage=en-GB\">in its comment</a> on the government's response to Francis. Imelda Redmond, director of policy and public affairs, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Francis Inquiry has highlighted some fundamental failures in our hospitals and we must ensure that high quality, patient-centred care is provided across all healthcare settings, be that in hospital, the community or hospices. We know the immense distress caused to a family and loved ones after someone dies in poor conditions and without the care that they need. The impact can last for years.</p> </blockquote> <p>The NHS Confederation has also published a statement. Its director of policy, Dr Johnny Marshall, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Crude national ratios around nursing numbers risks hitting the target, but missing the point. It would be possible for wards with seriously ill patients to meet the ratio, while having insufficient or the wrong mix of staff to actually meet patient needs.

The logic of the new system established by the Health and Social Care Act is one where clinical commissioners will only commission from providers who are responsive and deliver high quality services for patients.<br />Our concern is that a new edifice is being constructed that risk making similar mistakes to ones made before. Regulation and regulators cannot guarantee quality; who can are local commissioners who are committed to ensuring and assuring the quality of all providers in their area. Change depends on local leaders and staff who are committed to quality and ensuring that appropriate care is provided the first time around</p> </blockquote> <p>And Steve Kell, NHSCC Leadership Co-Chair and chair of Bassetlaw CCG, adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is welcome that there is an increasing emphasis on Boards owning complaints within their organisations. However for the system to be fully assured that issues are being identified and addresses, this information will need to be aligned with the soft and hard data being collected and analysed by CCGs.<br />We fully recognise that as CCGs and others continue to shine a light on quality within the NHS more problems are likely to emerge. Regulator will need to work with local commissioners to identify where improvement is needed and coordinate actions to resolving issues as they emerge.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T14:59:10.032Z\">at 2.59pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-528b73b6e4b0f15d741f6140\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T14:31:36.694Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>Helen Crane writes</em></p> <p>Nice, who the government's response to the Francis report states will take the lead on producing guidance on NHS staffing levels, have provided some further details on what this will involve<a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/newsroom/news/NICEToProduceGuidanceSafeNHSStaffingLevels.jsp\"> on their website</a>.</p> <p>They say they will undertake a &quot;comprehensive review of the evidence relating staffing levels, and will produce definitive guidance on safe and efficient staffing levels in a range of NHS settings&quot;.

Guardian health correspondent Denis Campbell writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Under his plan, hospitals that mislead or conceal information from patients affected by mistakes or from grieving relatives could either lose their indemnity cover or have it reduced. They may also be punished by having to pay out of their own funds part of the cost of settling lawsuits brought by patients, which can cost up to &pound;10m in compensation and legal fees, to force them to be much more open when medical negligence occurs. Hunt said that if a hospital was not open with patients and their families following a patient safety incident, its indemnity cover – which is key to its functioning – could be reduced or removed.

Look for the best. Find, promote and celebrate the best. A new organisation; the NAfFS. The National Agency for Fabulous Stuff.</p> <p>Yes, I know, a Naff idea but, think for a moment. When Colchester fell behind with their cancer treatments, they had two options. Confess or lie. How about giving them a third option. </p> <p>Just suppose they could have called the NAfFS and said; we have a problem treating cancer patients. Tell us; who is doing it well and will you ask them to help us, please? Just suppose the Trust with the solution was paid a consultancy fee for helping. Wouldn't that simple investment be cheaper than special measures, less costly than the damage to the NHS's reputation we have now and a sensible start to doing things safer and better?</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528b2e52e4b010b65d55614c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-19T09:31:28.813Z\">9.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><em>Helen Crane writes</em></p> <p>New on the network, we have an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/nov/19/bob-ricketts-nhs-england-commissioning\">interview with Bob Ricketts of NHS England</a>, in which he explains how the organisation will make services more efficient.

However, he will reject a fixed nurse-patient ratio. This is in response to the Francis report, which exposed failures of care in the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust. The health secretary will make his speech to parliament at 1pm. </p> <p>Right-wing think tank Reform has suggested that prescription charges should be raised to &pound;10, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24985242\">says the BBC</a>. Its report, published today, suggests that increasing the charge from &pound;7.85 could fund NHS services. Under its proposals there would be exemptions for people on low incomes, but not necessarily all pensioners. </p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0fbe892e-fafb-4ce1-8a1c-61d3e8161677\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384851223153/417ac1ee-0b03-4748-aa34-affe485b01b3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Reform think tank have suggested that the price of a prescription could be raised to &pound;10.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Reform think tank have suggested that the price of a prescription could be raised to &pound;10.
