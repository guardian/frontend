He went on:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given Labour agreed to this conference taking place in Sri Lanka, criticising my attendance I think breaks new records for opportunism and double-speak ...</p> <p>If [Miliband] knows anything about foreign affairs - and I doubt it, because he barely gets out of Islington - he would know this is a consensus organisation. Once something has been agreed, it is very difficult to unblock it. So it was in 2009 that the pass was sold.&nbsp;</p> <p>More than that, I think this shows very poor judgment. This is a multilateral organisation of which we are a leading member, our Queen is the head. How do we advance free trade if we're not there? ...</p> <p>If [Miliband] is concerned about the rights of Tamils, as I am, and reconciliation, the right thing to do is to go and shine a spotlight on their plight. You can't do that sitting at home.</p> <p>I remember when his brother said we needed foreign secretaries and prime ministers who could stop the traffic in Beijing. He won't even get out of Primrose Hill.</p> <p>I have to say this whole area of judgment by the right honourable gentleman is a sign of weakness.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• Cameron has said that Britain resisted an attempt at the summit to have Zimbabwe readmitted to the Commonwealth.</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/18/gay-tory-crispin-blunt-defeats-campaign-deselect\">•&nbsp;A gay former minister has fought off a campaign in his affluent Surrey constituency by opponents, who highlighted his&nbsp;sexuality, to block him standing as the Conservative party's candidate at the next general election.</a> </strong>As Nicholas Watt reports,&nbsp;Crispin Blunt, who served as prisons minister between 2010 and 2012, won a postal ballot of the membership of Reigate Conservative constituency association after senior national party figures rallied to his side amid fears that a defeat would harm the modernisation of the party</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/18/labour-party-co-op-chairman-paul-flowers-illegal-drugs\">• Paul Flowers, the former Co-operative Bank chairman, has been suspended by the Labour party after he was reportedly caught buying and using illegal drugs.</a></strong></p> <p><strong>• Labour has criticised<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnLehal/status/402385065927532544/photo/1\"> proposals from the Free Enterprise Group of Tory MPs</a> for VAT to be imposed on items currently exempt.</strong> The group said this would allow overall VAT rate to be cut to 15%, and that spare revenue would pay for measures to ensure that the poor do not lose out. But Phil Wilson, a Labour MP, said this idea was &quot;shocking&quot;.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This shocking proposal to increase the price of food and children's clothes by 15% shows the true face of David Cameron's Conservative Party. They don't understand the pressures facing British families, and they just don't care. At a time when families are facing a cost of living crisis, you have to be spectacularly out of touch to suggest putting VAT on food, children's clothes and books.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528a3cade4b010b65d556101\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T16:14:09.201Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Cameron accuses Labour of a &quot;'stick your head in the sand' approach to diplomacy&quot;.

He argued that &quot;sticking with the status quo&quot; and remaining in the UK had seen Scotland &quot;lose out on significant opportunities for growth, job creation and increased wealth&quot;. He spoke&nbsp;out as the Scottish government was preparing to publish a new report on the economic powers that leaving the UK would give the country and how it believes these could be used to boost growth and jobs north of the border. The paper, to be published tomorrow, will state that if the Scottish economy had grown at the same rate as other small, independent nations between 1977 and the start of the recession in 2007, GDP per capita would be 3.8% higher than it is now - the equivalent of &pound;900 per person.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• David Cameron has welcomed<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/18/uk-us-dark-web-online-child-abuse-internet\"> the news that Google will obstruct searches by people looking for child abuse images online </a>as a &quot;big breakthrough&quot;.</strong> This is what he told Jeremy Vine on BBC Radio 2.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a big breakthrough. You’ve got to go back to July when I came on your programme and I was saying look, there are some disgusting terms that people are searching for on the internet and they’re getting results that lead them to child pornographic images – and let’s remember every one of these images is a crime scene – and I said that internet companies and search engines should be cleaning up the internet and not providing returns. And I was told at the time that was something that couldn’t be done and something that shouldn’t be done because it was almost an intrusion on free speech.</p> <p>Now, to give full credit to the internet companies, they’ve worked extremely hard since then and they’ve now produced 100,000 terms that will get a clean return. And that is something they’re putting in place so that’s huge progress – and not just here in the UK; they’re going to roll that out across 159 countries. So this is a day when we can make some real progress against the absolute evil of child abuse and what happens on the internet.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the former Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) chief executive <strong>Jim Gamble</strong> told BBC's Breakfast programme this would not make much difference because serious paedophiles do not use Google.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't think this will make any difference with regard to protecting children from paedophiles.&nbsp;They don't go on to Google to search for images.&nbsp;They go on to the dark corners of the internet on peer-to-peer websites.</p> </blockquote> <p>To address this, Cameron has announced that GCHQ will play a more active role investigating the abuse of the &quot;dark web&quot;.

He replied:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, they’re going to have to have a discussion, aren’t they? The fact is, I think what ought to happen here, and what is going to happen now, is when you sign up to an internet service provider, when you take out your broadband account, you are prompted with an online message which is there are these pornography filters that are switched on – if you want to keep them, go ahead, particularly if you’ve got children in the house, if you want to take them off, you have to make an active choice.

That's partly because they are driven by market forces which are global ...</p> <p>We're an open economy. We will remain an open economy. We don't want to pull up the drawbridge. That would be bad for the country.</p> <p>But we certainly need to make sure that people who invest very large amounts of money into property in central London locations, which more often than not then stand empty, pay their fair share of tax in those transactions. That's why we are looking at things like a differential application of capital gains tax to those transactions. Decisions have not yet been made.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He suggested that the Lib Dems would accept introduce new higher rate council tax bands as an alternative to the mansion tax.</strong> The party still favoured the mansion tax as a means of increasing the tax on wealth, he said. But introducing new council tax bands would achieve much the same result. Clegg said it was unfair that people in reasonably large homes had to pay the same council tax as people with multi-million pound homes.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• He criticised the Tories for blocking mansion tax-style measures.</strong> He attacked &quot;downright prejudice on the part of my Conservative colleagues who simply don't want to ask people with very high-value properties to pay a bit extra&quot;.</p> <p><strong>• He said an independent Scotland would face “non-stop austerity”.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&nbsp;If anybody needs a salutary warning about the dangers of the break-up of Britain, of yanking Scotland out of the United Kingdom, one just needs to read this morning's independent and authoritative report from the IFS.&nbsp;It shows that there would have to be a dramatic level of cuts in public spending in Scotland if Scotland were to become independent in the way in which the SNP envisages. It amounts in the best-case scenario, according to the IFS, to a 6% cut in public spending in Scotland.&nbsp;</p> <p>I think it's not exaggerated to say that the IFS analysis suggests that the SNP objective of pulling Scotland out of the United Kingdom would condemn Scotland to a long period of non-stop austerity and spending cuts - not, I imagine, what many SNP supporters have in mind.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He suggested that the government could increase the money available to councils to help them alleviate the impact of the bedroom tax.</strong> The government has already set aside &pound;180m for discretionary housing payments (which councils can use on a case-by-case basis to help people facing particular problems because their housing benefit has been cut). Clegg hinted this could be increased.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will continue to look at that because we have been very clear that we will give the resources necessary to councils to use, particularly in those areas of large numbers of people receiving housing benefit in the social rented sector, and, if necessary, continue to provide resources through the discretionary housing payment so that no one is unfairly caught out. In a sense, we all accept that there there are going to be some hard cases. We want to make sure, now and in the future, that there is the hard cash to deal with those hard cases.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about the Lib Dem split when MPs voted on the bedroom tax last week, Clegg said everyone in the party agreed that it was reasonable to bring social housing housing benefit rules into line with the rules that apply to people in private sector housing, who for many years have been penalised if deemed to have a spare room. The split was about how to implement the move to the new system, he said.</p> <p><strong>• He claimed that, when the government set the share price for Royal Mail before its privatisation, it went for a price at the top end of the valuation recommended by its advisers.</strong></p> <p><strong>• He said that Eurosceptics were &quot;unpatriotic&quot; because their proposals were not in the national interest.</strong> In next year's European elections the Lib Dems would be the only party firmly committed to Britain staying in, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I’m relishing the opportunity to make that patriotic case because I think the view represented by Ukip and large parts of the Conservative party and Paul Sykes is a betrayal of the national interest, I think it is an unpatriotic approach because it would leave many people poorer, it would leave us more vulnerable, it would leave us weaker as a country.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>• He said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/17/falkirk-signatures-faked-selection-unite\">the review of industrial disputes announced yesterday</a> would cover issues like blacklisting, as well as alleged abuses by unions.</strong></p> <p><strong>• He renewed his call for Ed Miliband to publish the Labour inquiry into alleged ballot-rigging in Falkirk.</strong> The affair&nbsp;“looks more dodgy with each passing revelation”, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have every right to know who’s pulling the strings of the Labour party.

that July. </p> <p>In October 2010 Lyon handed the investigation over to Scotland Yard, telling them he had seen invoices &quot;which I believed might have been produced in a way which could raise questions of possible criminality&quot;. </p> <p>Officers were not given further details or access to key evidence the commissioner had gathered - including damning letters from MacShane in which he admitted using a &quot;nom de plume&quot; to fake thousands of pounds-worth of receipts from a body he controlled, the European Policy Institute (EPI). </p> <p>He wrote that the EPI had been a &quot;convenient vehicle&quot; to fund research trips to the continent. </p> <p>The material was withheld by the Commons authorities on the basis that it had been generated during parliamentary proceedings, and so was covered by the age-old principle of parliamentary privilege intended to guarantee politicians freedom of speech. </p> <p>The police were given access to MacShane's receipts and expenses records. </p> <p>But after considering the case for nearly two years, they announced in July 2012 that it was being dropped on advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. </p> <p>With the threat of criminal charges seemingly lifted, Lyon re-activated his investigation into MacShane's claims. </p> <p>And last November the cross-party Commons Standards and Privileges Committee finally recommended a 12-month suspension from the House, describing it as the &quot;gravest case which has come to us for adjudication, rather than being dealt with under the criminal law&quot;. </p> <p>MacShane, the MPs concluded, had filed &quot;19 false invoices over a period of four financial years which were plainly intended to deceive the parliamentary expenses authorities&quot;. </p> <p>The report also disclosed, for the first time, the scores of pages of correspondence between the commissioner and MacShane. </p> <p>The ensuing outcry forced MacShane's resignation as an MP, and police said they would be looking to see whether the information allowed them to proceed with the case against him. </p> <p>Even though the correspondence had been put into the public domain, the Commons authorities insisted it was still covered by parliamentary privilege - and so would not be admissible in court. </p> <p>Clerk of the Journals Liam Laurence Smyth suggested the only way police could use the material was as a &quot;map&quot; to further their own inquiries. </p> <p>It took detectives another two-and-a-half months to decide that there were grounds to reopen their investigation. </p> <p>And it was not until July that MacShane was formally charged with false accounting.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528a14ebe4b04416f8fd6b33\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T13:24:20.911Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And here's more from the PA on Denis MacShane.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>MacShane is understood to accept that he made a &quot;grotesque mistake&quot;. </p> <p>But he insists he did not make any personal gain from the claims. </p> <p>He has indicated that he told the police &quot;everything and more&quot;

Longer term, in the next Parliament we should be focusing on simply reducing headline rate of taxation. It’s straightforward, it’s transparent and it will help increase levels of disposable income.”</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509050/Scrap-stamp-duty-homes-500-000-Influential-group-Tories-Osborne-remove-fee-package-tax-cuts-help-middle-classes.html\">• And Jason Groves in the Daily Mail says the Free Enterprise Group wants to scrap stamp duty on homes worth less than &pound;500,000.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An influential group of Conservative MPs will today call for stamp duty to be scrapped on all homes worth less than &pound;500,000.</p> <p>The change would be included as part of a package of tax cuts to help Britain’s middle classes.</p> <p>The Free Enterprise Group will warn George Osborne that he needs to do much more to help those on middle incomes who have faced a severe financial squeeze during the recession.</p> <p>Proposals are expected to include the scrapping of stamp duty on most homes and a big rise in the threshold at which people start to pay income tax at the higher rate of 40 per cent.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/10456218/Parents-could-run-State-schools-for-profit-under-Tory-plan.html\">• James Kirkup in the Daily Telegraph says the Conservatives would allow parents to run schools for a profit under plans being drawn up for possible inclusion in the party's manifesto.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&nbsp;Groups of parents would form “co-operatives” to run a free school and then be able to pay themselves dividends if the school did not spend all of its budget, under the proposals.</p> <p>The plan is being developed by Steve Baker MP, a member of a Conservative Party commission drawing up public services policies for the next election.</p> <p>He told the Daily Telegraph that profit could be a “legitimate” way to offer people an incentive to set up their new schools.</p> <p>Free schools are state-funded but independent of local councils. They are based on similar institutions in Sweden, where the groups that operate them are allowed to make a profit.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e60f4956-4fa4-11e3-b06e-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz2kzddT7qb\">• Jim Pickard in the Financial Times (subscription) says thousands of workers who were blacklisted have been offered compensation worth up to &pound;100,000.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Thousands of construction workers on an industry blacklist have been offered compensation payouts of up to &pound;100,000 each, just as the government launches a review of malpractice by both unions and employers across all sectors.</p> <p>Eight major construction companies have set up a compensation fund for workers whose names appeared on a secret industry “blacklist”. The opening offer from the industry to 3,000 workers ranges from just &pound;1,000 to as much as &pound;100,000 per worker, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/10456202/We-should-be-humbly-thanking-the-super-rich-not-bashing-them.html\">• Boris Johnson in his Daily Telegraph column says that we should thank the super-rich, not bash them, and that those who pay the most tax should get automatic knighthoods.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&nbsp;There is no point in wasting any more moral or mental energy in being jealous of the very rich. They are no happier than anyone else; they just have more money. We shouldn’t bother ourselves about why they want all this money, or why it is nicer to have a bath with gold taps. How does it hurt me, with my 20-year-old Toyota, if somebody else has a swish Mercedes? We both get stuck in the same traffic.</p> <p>We should be helping all those who can to join the ranks of the super-rich, and we should stop any bashing or moaning or preaching or bitching and simply give thanks for the prodigious sums of money that they are contributing to the tax revenues of this country, and that enable us to look after our sick and our elderly and to build roads, railways and schools.</p> <p>Indeed, it is possible, as the American economist Art Laffer pointed out, that they might contribute even more if we cut their rates of tax; but it is time we recognised the heroic contribution they already make. In fact, we should stop publishing rich lists in favour of an annual list of the top 100 Tax Heroes, with automatic knighthoods for the top 10.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5289edb7e4b06f50dbc6f7ac\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T10:39:55.932Z\">10.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>At the Number 10 summit on internet child abuse David Cameron is going to say that GCHQ has been asked to step up the work it does targeting paedophiles who use the &quot;dark web &quot; to exchange images.

While some of these users will be using these networks for legal activity, British law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ assessment is that paedophiles involved in distributing new child abuse material are using such networks too.</p> <p>All internet technologies used by these offenders leave ‘digital footprints’ of some form. GCHQ’s work will tie together these footprints to create intelligence for the National Crime Agency to use in tracking and arresting offenders.

I have already posted what he said about the the Ed Balls &quot;nightmare&quot; email. (See <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/18/nick-cleggs-monthly-press-conference-politics-live-blog#block-5289d6b9e4b04416f8fd6afc\">9.05am.)</a> Here are the other key points.</p> <p><strong>• Miliband confirmed that Labour would extend free childcare for three and four-year-olds from 15 hours a week to 25 hours a week.</strong> This would be worth &pound;1,500 a year to some families, he said. Childcare was a cost of living issue, he said. He said that although he has been focusing on energy bills recently, he also wants Labour to help parents with childcare costs.</p> <p><strong>• He said that Labour would fund the pledge by increasing the bank levy and that he did not expect the banks to pass on the extra costs to customers.</strong> &quot;The banks are actually making very big profits and I think they can afford to pay a bit more to help families,&quot; he said.</p> <p><strong>• He said that the cost of a nursery place had increased by 30% since the election.</strong> That was nearly five times the rate of the average wage rise, he said.</p> <p><strong>• He defended Labour's claim that more than 500 Sure Start centres have closed under the coalition.</strong> &quot;I think our figures are correct,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&quot;We've seen hundreds of Sure Start centres no longer there,&quot; he said. The government claims only 45 have closed.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>• He said he supported what David Cameron had done to get Google to block access to child abuse images on the internet</strong>. &quot;I think anything that can be done to protect children is really important,&quot; he said.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-510e8877-ac56-4143-acfc-29f07d6e6eb4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/18/1384766965947/6e432d8e-2868-4ca2-8e74-de424c317a23-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Miliband.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Ed Miliband.

What do you think we should ask him?</p> <p>Otherwise, it's reasonably busy. <strong>Ed Miliband</strong> is giving a speech on childcare later. He was on ITV's Daybreak earlier and he used it to play dow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/17/ed-miliband-fat-finger-email-ed-balls\">the revelation yesterday that a member of his staff described Ed Balls as a &quot;nightmare&quot; in a private email. </a>Here's the key quote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s fair to say that people send silly emails in offices and this was one of them. Ed and I are working really well together, I’m really proud to have him as the shadow chancellor working alongside me. He’s somebody who I think has been right in his criticism of the Government’s economic policy and he’s also leading the way on this cost of living crisis that we’ve been talking about. So, as I say, people send silly emails in offices but that’s all it is.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'll post more from the interview shortly.</p> <p>Here's the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The Tory Free Enterprise Group holds a briefing on its proposals ahead of the 2013 autumn statement.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Nick Clegg hosts a press conference.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> Ed Miliband is&nbsp;giving a speech on childcare.

As the Guardian reports,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/18/uk-us-dark-web-online-child-abuse-internet\"> Google has already announced that it is taking steps to stop people running searches related to online child abuse.</a></p> <p>As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.
