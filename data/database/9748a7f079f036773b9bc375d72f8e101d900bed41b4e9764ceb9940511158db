The Thanksgiving effect contributed to a firmer hold in the US. This dollop of The Hunger Games has been frontloaded more than previous ones – opening simultaneously in close to 90 territories rather than 40-something – so no surprise either that it is ahead of the last two at the second-weekend mark: $254.6m overseas against $146.1m. What is concerning is that many individual countries are tracking lower than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire\">Catching Fire</a> at the same point. Most rich countries grossed lower this weekend, and their overall second-week take also dropped; that’s even happening in some emerging markets, like Russia (Catching Fire, second weekend: $5.4m; Mockingjay: $2.5m). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/21/hunger-games-mockingjay-homesman-winter-sleep-get-on-up-video-film-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43g5t\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2196630\"                data-video-name=\"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, The Homesman, Winter Sleep and Get On Up: the Guardian film show – video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/21/1416561783266/Jennifer-Lawrence-in-The--014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452346654\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/21/1416561781706/Jennifer-Lawrence-in-The--013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames/141120TGFSHungerGames.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>It’s in less mature markets, like Mexico (Catching Fire: $4.3m; Mockingjay: $4.4m) and Brazil ($2.7m; $3.8m), where affection seems to be building. It’s probably too early – especially with $480.3m already banked, and given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/26/global-box-office-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-interstellar-dumb-and-dumber-to\">law of cleft final chapters</a> described last week – to declare a general cooling-off. But it’s interesting for anyone given to thinking about blockbusters in geopolitical terms that, to adopt Hunger Games parlance, heat for the franchise is now burning strongest outside <a href=\"http://thehungergames.wikia.com/wiki/The_Capitol\">the Capitol</a>.<br /></p> <h2>Laddie marmalade</h2> <p>There’s no doubt that StudioCanal’s fondly received <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paddington\">Paddington</a> adaptation has got off to a very fine start. Michael Bond’s diminutive bear has nipped between the legs of The Hunger Games for an $8m No 1 in his UK home market, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/dec/02/paddington-beats-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-at-uk-box-office\">the second best family-film debut in 2014 after The Lego Movie</a>. Paddington’s homeland, Peru, also got the film in its first week, where it did a tidy $405,000 – less than other kids’ fare there this year, like Mr Peabody and Sherman ($491,000), but higher than Interstellar ($369,000). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/28/paddington-concerning-violence-horrible-bosses-2-2001-a-space-odyssey-video-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43yhj\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2200600\"                data-video-name=\"Paddington, Concerning Violence, Horrible Bosses 2 and 2001: A Space Odyssey: Guardian film show – video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169977700/Paddington-Bear-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452743397\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169974735/Paddington-Bear-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington/141127TGFSPaddington.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Lacking a local tie-in, Paddington didn’t make as much of a splash in the much larger Mexican market, its other inaugural territory, taking little more than $1m. Translated into 30 languages and having sold 30m books, there’s no doubt that the dude in the duffle coat has worldwide appeal – which is why StudioCanal are releasing their film in 40 countries through to next February. Judging by the UK result and the superior quality, Paddington shouldn’t flinch from believing he can match the mighty worldwide grosses chalked by his predecessors in the mixed live-action/CGI kids’ bracket: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/24/the-smurfs-review\">The Smurfs</a> (2011, $563.7m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122289/alvin-and-the-chipmunks\">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a> (2007, $361.3m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/82594/stuart.little\">Stuart Little</a> (1999, $300.1m) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/10/yogi-bear-review\">Yogi Bear</a> (2010, $201m).<br /></p> <h2>Flightless birds</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5099a71adfa73c317cc4b0d35e062db5b86aca26\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417613938952/9d491c0f-8277-40c2-82e8-a31eabea7bae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Penguins of Madagascar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rudderless Skipper … Penguins of Madagascar’s disappointing returns could herald the end for the franchise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DreamWorks Animation/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picking up a penguin was not top priority for American audiences this weekend, with Dreamworks’ Madagascar spin-off debuting at a chilly $25.4m ($36m with Thanksgiving takings included) – despite sheltering under the franchise umbrella and being based on a popular Nickelodeon cartoon. That’s a low for the series, well below the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/106958/madagascar\">first film</a>’s $47.2m in 2005. Possibly it found itself squeezed between sharper-looking animation Big Hero 6, and the Hunger Games juggernaut, which swept off many of the adults who might otherwise have been attracted by the in-jokey overtures now standard for CGI cartoons (how many kids are going to get a <a href=\"http://youtu.be/BjfID263ViI?t=35s\">Werner Herzog shoutout</a>?). As emphasised in the trailers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/26/penguins-of-madagascar-review-benedict-cumberbatch\">Penguins of Madagascar</a> also follows the global-location itinerary (Venice, Shanghai, New York) demanded of big studio films these days. But it looks unlikely that its real-world passage will leave flames behind it. The early Chinese release ($30m+ and counting) bulks out a sparse-looking initial whip-round ($36.5m overseas this week in 45 territories, compared to Madagascar 3’s $77.2m from 25 in 2012). With plenty left on its rollout – including the UK this week, where Cumberbatch fever (he voices a covert-ops wolf) should win it fans – it should make good on a $132m outlay. But the Madagascar series could be running low on juice.<br /></p> <h2>Loss leaders</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/26/jennifer-aniston-horrible-bosses-2-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43j5p\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2198824\"                data-video-name=\"Jennifer Aniston on Horrible Bosses 2: 'I loved playing someone so twisted' – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933386241/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452595484\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933365269/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses/141125HorribleBosses.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>The Horrible Bosses franchise looks an even more conspicuous candidate for collecting its belongings and leaving the building after a shaky start for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horrible-bosses-2\">the sequel</a>. A haul of $15.5m Stateside for director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1890845/\">Sean Anders</a> (also co-writer on other current top 10 denizen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dumb-and-dumber-to\">Dumb and Dumber To</a>) is underwhelming, to put it mildly - nearly half of the first’s $28.3m in 2011. Taking $11.3m from 44 international locales is even more disappointing, with even the best results scraping into the medal places (Russia, $1.8m, No 3; UK, $2m, No 4; Germany, $1.1m, No 4; Mexico, $1.1m, No 3). The strange thing is that the second film is an improvement in some ways – more coherently plotted, and featuring snappy editing that shows off the souped-up budget (up $8m to $43m). So what’s gone wrong? I’d lay it at the door of Warners’ garbled marketing, which has failed to freshen up the hashtag immediacy of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142717/horrible-bosses\">original film</a>’s premise: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell playing “psycho”, “maneater” and “tool” respectively. New bosses Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine – the venture-capitalist father-and-son duo in charge of the torment this time – don’t register as succinctly in the sequel. That has trickled down into ineffectual posters and ads that fail to pull the same trick twice: convincing the perpetually online, zero-hours generation currently in their 20s that a comedy starring three men in their late 30s and early 40s is about them.</p> <h2>The rest of the world</h2> <p>After Johnnie To’s recent Don’t Go Breaking My Heart 2, yet another metropolitan love triangle landed high in the Chinese charts (and 7th worldwide) in the shape of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhgBKQnjkk8\">Women Who Flirt</a>, directed by Pang Ho-cheung, the Hong Kong veteran responsible for 2010’s lauded <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_a_Puff\">Love in a Puff</a>. As well as the $11.5m or so it took around Asia, it also enjoyed an $80,000 snifter in the US, despite reviews taking varying degrees of umbrage with its throwback frivolity. Three places below it in the global rankings, with $8m, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjP4M1TZ2ac\">The Best, the Lost</a> – another Chinese film mining another contemporary trope, the halcyon-days 1990s college drama made big business by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOZz_Mfuslw\">So Young</a>, which took $114m in 2012. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YubQzbzGHps\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YubQzbzGHps?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In top place in France and 14th globally, the ninth Asterix animation, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xRNY_9nb8o\">Land of the Gods</a>, opened at $5m, an upwards move for the pigtailed Gallic insurrectionist, here making his first CGI outing, after a $3.4m bow for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371552/\">Asterix and the Vikings</a> in 2006. That still lacks the crucial magic-potion ingredient compared to $20m-ish French debuts for the live-action (and big-budget) Asterix films of recent years. A return of $3.4m for the Korean action comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_To7w9_AUn4\">Big Match</a> was good for second spot there and 15th in the worldwide list. Lee Jung-jae stars as a mixed martial-arts star forced into a series of real-time hi-tech games in order to save his brother’s life. Who said Hollywood had a monopoly on daft high concepts? <br /></p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Penguins of Madagascar, Horrible Bosses 2 and Paddington all continue their rollouts next week – the last hoping to prove its mettle on a global stage in the key markets of France, Brazil, Germany and Japan. Ahead of its US opening on 12 December, Ridley Scott’s Moses epic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/exodus\">Exodus: Gods and Kings</a> stakes out safe theological ground with early engagements in Catholic countries including Mexico, Spain, Argentina and the Philippines, and also South Korea, whose Christian population is larger than its Buddhist one; Noah followed a similar pattern. Singham star Ajay Devgan leads the line on the $15.3m Indian action comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YubQzbzGHps\">Action Jackson</a>, one of Bollywood’s most expensive for 2014 (Shah Rukh Khan’s Happy New Year, at $21m, is reportedly the priciest). Adapted from the Telugu film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1756476/\">Dookudu</a>, having seemingly acquired some Kill Bill stylings on the way, Action Jackson is also getting the typical diaspora-oriented overseas release through Eros International. And December blockbuster season began in earnest in China on Tuesday, when the first part of John Woo’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmBfWxp1-z4\">The Crossing</a> pushed off the jetty. Based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_%28steamer%29\">the sinking of a Taiwan-bound steamer in 1949</a>, the $49m film has been dubbed the Chinese Titanic.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/04/terminator-salvation-film-review\">Terminator Salvation</a>.<br /></p> <p>In <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/q-a-with-actor-christian-bale-1417449357\">an interview with the Wall Street Journal</a>, the British actor confirmed he had doubts about working with the Charlie’s Angels director prior to joining the cast of the fourth Terminator film, but was swayed by the film-maker’s enthusiasm. </p> <p>“He goes, ‘Give me a chance. Everyone needs to evolve, and I need to turn over a new leaf. And please, you must’ve been in this position before yourself, when someone has taken a leap of faith on you,’ – which I have – ‘please do that for me now; I promise you, I’m ready for it’.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcYdjHpJUV8\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcYdjHpJUV8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately for Bale – and McG – Terminator Salvation turned out to be the weakest instalment yet in the long-running sci-fi saga created by James Cameron. It received lukewarm reviews from critics and took just $371m <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=terminator.htm\">at the global box office</a>, down almost $150m from the series’ high water mark, 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Adjusted for inflation, Salvation would have taken around a third of its predecessor’s total.</p> <p>When asked if he was right to have given McG a chance, Bale replied: “There’s a lot of room for many approaches and many characters within the film industry. I won’t be working with him again, but I wish him very well. OK?”</p> <p>Bale also discussed berating a paparazzo in Italy who had insulted his wife, but said he was otherwise uninterested in the kind of campaigning currently conducted by George Clooney. “It’s boring, isn’t it? You know what I mean? It doesn’t matter that he talks about it,” he said. “It’s like, come on, guys, just shut up. Just get on with it and live your lives and stop whining about it. I prefer not to whine about it.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/17/profile-christian-bale-terminator-film\">• Profile: Christian Bale<br /></a><a

organisation, whose best-of list is voted for by critics, film-makers and academics, casts one of the first stones in the annual awards season that culminates in the Oscars.

Isaac shared the best actor award with Michael Keaton for his performance in Birdman, while Isaac’s co-star Jessica Chastain took the supporting actress award. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/07/a-most-violent-year-review-plucky-outsider-draws-blood-in-this-years-oscar-battle\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Xan Brooks described the film as “rigorous, resourceful and as smart as a whip.

But its canny tactical struggle remains a joy to behold.”</p> <p>Also appearing in A Most Violent Year is David Oyelowo, the British actor tipped for awards season recognition in civil rights drama Selma, which won a Freedom of Expression award.</p> <p>Other National Board of Review winners included Julianne Moore, who plays a woman suffering early onset Alzheimer’s in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/12/still-alice-alzheimers-julianne-moore-alec-baldwin-film\">Still Alice</a>, and Clint Eastwood, awarded best director for American Sniper. British actor Jack O’Connell won the Breakthrough performance award for his work in Starred Up and Unbroken.</p> <p>The Lego Movie won the best original screenplay award, suggesting it might break out of the animated movie ghetto this season, while Chris Rock was given the special Spotlight award for writing, directing and starring in Top Five.</p> <h2>Full list of winners</h2> <p><strong>Best

The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were sold by Professor Tolkien in the late 60s, the film rights,” Jackson said. “They are the only two works of his that have ever been sold … So without the co-operation of the Tolkien Estate, there can’t be any more films.”<br />While The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are by far Tolkien’s best-known fantasy works, the author also wrote numerous other stories about Middle-earth. The most famous is the posthumously published The Silmarillion, a collection of histories and tales written to flesh out Tolkien’s mythos prior to the time of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/29/hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-trailer-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4vbba\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2134090\"                data-video-name=\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies: watch the teaser trailer - video\"                data-video-provider=\"Warner Bros\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/29/1406649695456/The-Hobbit-The-Battle-of--017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-443296405\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/29/1406649679470/The-Hobbit-The-Battle-of--007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit/140729Hobbit.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Ian McKellen, who plays the wizard Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, said at the premiere that he expected further films to be made in the future. Yet Tolkien’s son and literary executor Christopher is known to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30283141\">extremely resistant</a> to the idea.</p> <p>“Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed by the absurdity of our time,” he told Le Monde in 2012. “The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialisation has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away.”</p> <p>Jackson may not have helped matters by splitting The Hobbit, a breezy children’s fable, into three epic movies complete with numerous new characters not imagined by Tolkien.

supervillain movie based on the DC Comics series, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/suicide-squad-cast-revealed-jared-leto-to-play-the-joker-will-smith-is-deadshot-1201368867/\">according to Variety</a>.</p> <p>Leto, in one of his first roles after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/03/oscars-broadcast-stopped-russia-jared-leto-ukraine\">winning the best supporting actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club</a>, becomes the first actor since The Dark Knight’s late Heath Ledger to play the Joker on the big screen. Smith, in a rare shift into ensemble fare, plays hired assassin Deadshot, while Hardy is military expert Rick Flag. </p> <p>Robbie has signed up to play Harley Quinn, another traditional enemy of Batman, while Delevingne will portray magical villain Enchantress. Jay Courtney, an Australian actor best known for his turns in Jack Reacher and Divergent, takes the role of dysfunctional villain Boomerang, traditionally an enemy of the Flash.</p> <p>Suicide Squad was revealed as part of Warner’s slate of 10 movies based around the DC Comics universe – an ambitious bid to take on Disney-owned Marvel Studio’s own hugely successful series of interlinked superhero films – in October. The original comic book, inspired by warsploitation fare such as The Dirty Dozen, is about a team of supervillains recruited to take on suicide black-ops missions in return for the commutation of their sentences. Fury’s David Ayer will direct the film version.</p> <p>“The Warner Bros roots are deep on this one,” said studio president Greg Silverman said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under David Ayer’s amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero.”</p> <p>There could yet be more star names joining the cast. Jesse Eisenberg – Lex Luthor in the upcoming superhero face-off Batman v Superman – is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/27/jesse-eisenbergs-lex-luthor-suicide-squad-superman-dawn-justice\">reported to be in talks to join the team</a>, while Warner is on the hunt for a high-profile signing to portray Amanda Waller. The latter is the Rick Fury of the series, the operative who chooses missions and sets out the Suicide Squad’s terms of engagement. Oprah Winfrey is reportedly the studio’s top choice, with Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer also said to be in the running.<br /></p>","headline":"Will Smith, Jared Leto and Tom Hardy sign up for

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks\">Paul Katis</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Entertainment grade: B+</strong></p> <p><strong>History grade: A</strong></p> <p>The 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (known as 3 Para) of the British army originated in the second world war. The 3 Para Battle Group was deployed in Afghanistan in 2006.</p> <h2>Politics</h2> <p>The film begins on 5 September 2006 near the Kajaki dam in Helmand province. One of the men of 3 Para is addressing two Afghan boys who have just nearly killed him while indulging in the adorable childhood pastime of grenade-fishing. “I’m here trying to bring peace and love to your fucking stone-age country,” he explains. “Don’t pick a fight with an armed midget,” his buddy warns him. The unspoken question behind the film is set up: what are British soldiers doing in Afghanistan, anyway? Some critics have felt this film lacks engagement with the local population or the wider scope of the war, but surely that’s exactly the point: these soldiers are just ordinary blokes (they’re all blokes), a long way from home, doing an incredibly dangerous job without much sense of why.</p> <h2>History</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5vhurFXu5c\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5vhurFXu5c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks\">The film neatly underlines this</a> when the men return to Observation Post Normandy, a tiny camp at which members of 3 Para Mortar Platoon and 3 Para Support Company are bivouacked. One of the soldiers, armed with a Penguin classics edition, reads out a few lines of a poem: “When you’re wounded and left on Afghanistan’s plains/ And the women come out to cut up what remains/ Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains/ An’ go to your Gawd like a soldier.” This is from <a href=\"http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_youngbrit.htm\">Rudyard Kipling’s The Young British Soldier</a>, published in his 1892 volume Barrack-Room Ballads. It is quoted in Patrick Bishop’s 3 Para, a gripping history of the battle group in Afghanistan. There and here, it makes an important point: that the most recent Afghanistan campaign has historical echoes in the Anglo-Afghan wars of the 19th century.</p> <h2>Legacy</h2> <p>The soldiers spot what appears to be an illegal Taliban checkpoint set up on the road below their observation post. It’s too far away for a sniper to take out the suspects, so they decide to go down to investigate. “This country’s full of shit left behind when armies fucked off,” says one. “Russians, it was the mines. Ten million fucking mines. God knows what we’re going to leave behind.” Good question.</p> <h2>Disaster</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ccb777bb169b488eae4b466d79c96b6ef79bd4c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417533149414/8c43246c-5ed4-4b61-803f-ff27eff3848d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kajaki - Andy Barlow (played by Liam Ainsworth)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Barlow (played by Liam Ainsworth)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three soldiers walk down a goat track towards the checkpoint. Then, all of a sudden, Lance-Corporal Stuart Hale (Benjamin O’Mahony) finds one of those Soviet mines. “I didn’t see a flash or feel a blast or heat,” the real Hale said later. “It was as if I’d stood on a banana skin.” The bottom half of his leg is gone. Medic Lance Corporal Paul “Tug” Hartley (Mark Stanley) hurries down with other soldiers. Though they take precautions in trying to reach Hale, there is soon another explosion and more are wounded. Corporal Stuart Pearson (Scott Kyle) has to deal with his own leg being blown off (everyone in 3 Para had basic medical training, as you might glean from the film). One of the men present, Private Jay Davis, said of Pearson’s reaction in real life: “He put the tourniquet on himself, put morphine into himself and we just had to leave him.” A Chinook helicopter arrives to save the men, but it can’t land because they are, of course, in a minefield – and it isn’t equipped with the winches it needs to hoist them up. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/17/chinook-inquest-military-afghanistan\">Unfortunately, this is accurate</a>. As the Chinook leaves, it whips up a dust cloud – and another mine is set off.</p> <h2>Humour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa1c0e45c1a7dbab16f0f9d3653a6c5d3bdf0ef6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417537930543/bf89544b-4b07-40c2-85c9-8a35fcf0a55d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kajaki - film still Andy Barlow (played by Liam Ainsworth), Luke Mauro (Jon-Paul Bell), Dave Prosser (John Doughty), Jay Davis (Paul Luebke), Spud McMellon (Ali Cook), Mark Wright (David Elliot)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kajaki … Andy Barlow (Liam Ainsworth), Luke Mauro (Jon-Paul Bell), Dave Prosser (John Doughty), Jay Davis (Paul Luebke), Spud McMellon (Ali Cook), Mark Wright (David Elliot)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the fact that so many of them were seriously injured, Patrick Bishop’s account specifically says the men kept a sense of humour throughout their six-and-a-half-hour ordeal: “[Corporal Mark] Wright made brave jokes about the amount of insurance that would be coming to him.” The film’s strong screenplay, by Tom Williams, captures the tone of the soldiers’ dialogue authentically – tough, practical and witty, with any hint of sentimentality quickly cut down. “I’ll be legless every night now,” ruminates one of the wounded. Not only is this accurate; it’s also in a long British army tradition that you can see a century ago in the popular first world war commemoration volume <a href=\"http://www.firstworldwar.com/diaries/cockney_cricketonthesomme.htm\">500 Cockney War Stories</a>. In that book, one cricket-loving soldier is said to have reacted to having two comrades killed and his own leg blown off by reporting: “One over – two bowled – and I’m stumped.”</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Kajaki is an unusual war film: rather than focusing on combat, it shows a foreign army dealing with the legacy of previous foreign armies in a much-invaded territory. It’s a fascinating and apposite take on the war in Afghanistan – and one which takes care to get its facts right.</p>","headline":"Kajaki – an impressive war movie with questions and ballistic grit","trailText":"A group of paras get stuck in a minefield in this historically accurate, mordant account of death and soldiering in Afghanistan in 2006, writes <strong>Alex von Tunzelmann</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417529384968/Kajaki-film-still-004.jpg","wordcount":"837","commentable":"true","byline":"Alex von Tunzelmann","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-09T14:03:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/03/kajaki-reel-history-british-army-afghanistan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/03/kajaki-reel-history-british-army-afghanistan","tags":[{"id":"film/series/reelhistory","webTitle":"Reel history","description":"The historian Alex von Tunzelmann watches classics of big screen history and prises fact from fiction","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/reelhistory","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/reelhistory","references":[]},{"id":"film/kajaki","webTitle":"Kajaki","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kajaki","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/kajaki","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/war-films","webTitle":"War films","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/war-films","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/war-films","references":[]},{"id":"world/afghanistan","webTitle":"Afghanistan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/afghanistan","references":[]},{"id":"uk/british-army","webTitle":"British Army","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/british-army","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/british-army","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alexvontunzelmann","webTitle":"Alex von Tunzelmann","r2ContributorId":"25529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/07/21/alex_vontunzelmann_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"vontunzelmann","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alex von Tunzelmann is a historian and writer.

reviews dozens of films but hasn’t seen any of them. Tommy Edison, aka the Blind Film Critic, talks American Hustle, audio description and the joys of ‘watching’ his first silent movie</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The next time you’re watching a big budget action movie – a superhero spectacle, perhaps, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jan/09/why-we-love-michael-bay-transformers\">or a Michael Bay-directed brain hemorrhage</a> – try this out. When a chaotic special effects-stuffed scene is just about to click into top gear, close your eyes. Keep them closed. And only open them only once the scene is over. Then ask yourself: what happened? Did all those audio effects tell a story or were they just a collection of thuds, screeches and explosions?</p> <p>The way sound and music convey information is an area of particular interest for film critic Tommy Edison. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyEdisonXP\">A star on YouTube</a>, where his videos regularly rack up more than a million views a piece, Edison has reviewed dozens of movies with his signature good-natured style: lots of humour, lots of self-deprecation and lots of fast-paced banter.</p> <p>But he hasn’t, in the strictest sense, watched any of them. Born with an undeveloped optic nerve, Edison has never been able to see. Endorsed by the legendary film reviewer Roger Ebert in 2011, and having chalked up appearances on countless US media outlets from CNN to the Howard Stern Show, Edison is known as the Blind Critic. </p> <p>His motto: “No spoilers. I don’t even know what happened.”</p> <p>The chatty American’s idea for his channel was borne out of frustration. As a film lover, he watched (for want of a better word) as film after film revealed its key plot moments using a visual language he has never been able to translate. A language that understandably left him hanging.</p> <p>“I thought it might be fun to review movies from a blind person’s perspective to show sighted people what that frustration is like,” says Edison. </p> <p>“Some people say: ‘How can you even review a movie? You can’t even see it.’” But a word to the wise, he says: “After 1928, they started putting dialogue in films. They’re not all silent any more! Before that, OK, yeah, I couldn’t review movies. But now I can and I love it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB-s7x26y88\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB-s7x26y88?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Edison’s favourite films may surprise. “I loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB-s7x26y88\">Hugo</a>. And you wouldn’t think so, because it’s this giant beautiful thing to look at. But that story just was cooking. I love <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCpePGwe08\">Goodfellas</a>. I mean, who doesn’t love Goodfellas? That’s a film I believe any sighted person could watch that without pictures, on a broken television, and be able to understand. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwZT9UBEJaE\">Clerks</a> was another one like that. I also really liked American Hustle. That movie won awards for costume design, which was completely lost on me!”</p> <p>Edison is currently in Australia as a guest of the <a href=\"http://otherfilmfestival.com/\">Other Film Festival</a> (Toff) at Melbourne Brain Centre. Billed as the world’s leading disability film festival, Toff programs a suite of films and events themed “to embrace the lived experience of disability”. </p> <p>A topic regularly discussed is audio description. Available in only a small number of cinemas and DVDs (provision is constantly lobbied for by the vision-impaired community), it’s essentially a voiceover track that narrates visual experiences so audiences without sight can understand them. The technology allowed Edison to experience his first silent film last year. “I got it. I knew what it was. That was huge for me,” he says. “Pardon the pun, but it was really eye-opening.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"119674ff0a5188e7c19b73499ef4e0553a25e7da\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417563070296/a4b6c69b-6fc0-4fc9-8582-c707fbfe4031-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"American Hustle's costumes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American Hustle’s costumes were ‘lost on me’, says Edison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Duhamel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, Toff will hold a competition to create the best audio description of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcyzubFvBsA\">FW Murnau’s 1922 horror classic Nosferatu</a> – and Edison is one of the judges. But when it comes to the films he reviews as the Blind Critic, having audio description – or even a friend telling him what’s happening – is against his rules.</p> <p>“It would sort of cloud my viewing or understanding of the film, because then it would be about their experience,” he says of the describer. “I can ask questions when it’s all over. But during it I don’t want to know. I’d rather try to figure it out by myself.”</p> <p>Edison’s candid and funny film reviews, and his persona as an affable pun-slinging chap who would never wish to be pitied, has led to another kind of fame. He now spends much of his time<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyEdisonXP\"> making videos</a> that address questions random commenters used to pose to him under the line on his YouTube reviews about living with blindness. Questions like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzah0A6IC5o&amp;list=PL775406A89C7B0AE9\">“how do blind people use the ATM?”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbiim4OaqDg&amp;list=TLxLIdPVzkejQ\">“can blind people open their eyes?”</a></p> <p>So for the record, yes, he dreams, but he cannot see in them (“my subconscious doesn’t know how”). Yes, he enjoys a tipple, though he doesn’t quite know what to make of “beer goggles”. Yes, he relies on his other senses, but doesn’t think his ability to use them is innately better than yours or mine. And no, he doesn’t understand what colours are. </p> <p>And on the subject of attraction and falling in love? “I do it backwards,” he says. “People look at a person in a bar or something like that and think: my god I’ve got to talk to them. Then after you get talking you learn what their mind is like. I do it the other way. I learn somebody’s mind first and then I learn what they look like afterwards. I think that’s wonderful.”</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://otherfilmfestival.com/\">The Other Film Festival </a>runs from 3 to 7 December at Melbourne Brain Centre</p>","headline":"No spoilers: meet the film critic who's never watched a single film","trailText":"He reviews dozens of movies but hasn’t seen any of them.

The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/-sp-north-korea-hack-sony\" title=\"\">absurd move</a> was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/01/north-korea-sony-hacked-the-interview\" title=\"\">floated yesterday</a> when the notoriously paranoid nation was accused of hacking into the Sony Pictures computer system in pre-emptive retaliation for forthcoming comedy The Interview, which stars Rogen and James Franco as journalists who are granted a rare television interview with Kim Jong-un and then urged by the CIA to assassinate him.</p> <p>“To allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war,” thundered North Korea’s UN ambassador in July. By which logic, we’d have been at war with Malaysia over Zoolander for over a decade now.</p> <p>This is merely the latest skirmish in an ongoing cinematic cold war, however. North Korea was fine with being branded part of Bush’s “Axis of Evil”, but mock them and they won’t see the funny side.</p> <p>They certainly weren’t laughing when Kim Jong-il was ridiculed as a pathetic, isolated dictator in Team America: World Police, singing his borderline-racist ballad I’m So Ronery around his empty palace. “Such behaviour is not part of our country’s political culture. Therefore, we want the film to be banned,’’ their diplomats complained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3517ea12cfef27d44e533d7f58a2b41b851bf89\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417542166694/d636f3cc-7c81-4860-a665-0ff1262a453e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kim Jong-il was ridiculed as a pathetic, isolated dictator in the film Team America.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Jong-il was ridiculed as a pathetic, isolated dictator in the film Team America.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PARAMOUNT/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor were they amused when James Bond faced off against a North Korean baddie in Die Another Day, in a movie that depicted their glorious nation as technologically primitive and stereotypically torture-happy. “A dirty and cursed burlesque aimed to slander and insult the Korean nation” was <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=20030115&amp;id=mA0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KUgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5004,1486209\" title=\"\">Pyongyang’s verdict</a>.</p> <p>The less North Korea finds it amusing, the funnier it gets – until they start a nuclear war, at least. They might have a point, mind you. In recent years, we’ve had North Koreans failing to invade the US in the Red Dawn remake (in the original it was Russians), North Koreans failing to hijack the White House in Olympus Has Fallen, and North Koreans abusing Angelina Jolie in Salt with their fiendish Oriental torture methods, just as they did back in the 1950s in movies including The Bamboo Prison or Prisoner Of War.</p> <p>Hollywood can hardly congratulate itself for taking a principled political stand here. North Korea is an easy target. There’s no export market there for a start, in glaring contrast to its equally undemocratic but immeasurably more powerful neighbour: China. Often, North Korea is merely a last-minute substitute. The Red Dawn remake actually started out with China as the invading force, but when Beijing started to grumble, they <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/16/entertainment/la-et-china-red-dawn-20110316\" title=\"\">hastily removed the Chinese flags and dialogue</a> and made the invaders North Korean instead. Cinema has had a fine tradition of ridiculing dictators and despots, from Charlie Chaplin to Sacha Baron Cohen, but what’s equally telling is the dictators they <em>don’t</em> ridicule. If there’s a sequel to The Interview, perhaps Seth Rogen can go and try to assassinate Xi Jinping. That’s how to start a proper war.</p>","headline":"Why do film-makers keep trolling North Korea?","trailText":"The country is fuming about the Seth Rogen movie The Interview – the latest film to wind up Kim Jong-un.

ursine hero draws in a family audience to nudge Hunger Games: Mockingjay off the top spot</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<h2>The winner</h2> <p>When StudioCanal jumped on board Paddington, after Warners opted not to proceed with a screenplay it had long developed, the company was taking a significant risk. Its biggest ever UK production had the potential to reach a large audience, especially in the UK, but it came with a hefty price tag, due to the cost of blending live action with a CGI character. And did children really know, and care about, Paddington bear, who owed his origins to Michael Bond’s stories dating back to 1958? A late switch of voice actor from Colin Firth to Ben Whishaw could be interpreted negatively as a problem that needed fixing.</p> <p>It’s doubtless with a mix of relief and jubilation that StudioCanal tallied initial box office receipts. An opening weekend of £5.13m is the second biggest debut for a family film this year, behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-lego-movie\">The Lego Movie</a>. (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/maleficent\">Maleficent</a>’s £6.59m opening frame includes £2.77m in previews.) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen\">Frozen</a>, which proved the top draw for families last Christmas, began with £4.70m. Paddington has delivered the biggest opening weekend for a live-action family film since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131099/alice-in-wonderland\">Alice in Wonderland</a>, in March 2010 – unless you count the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/07/harry-potter-deathly-hallows-part-2-review\">final Harry Potter film</a>, which was a 12A certificate.</p> <p>StudioCanal’s previous biggest hit was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy\">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>, taking £14.21m. It’s a dead certainty that Paddington will exceed that total, and the well-reviewed film, which enjoys a 7.9/10 user rating at IMDb, could go a lot further. StudioCanal also currently has The Imitation Game in play at £9.48m so far, and with a fair wind – including Bafta and Oscar nominations – the second world war codebreaking drama could reach Tinker Tailor levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/28/paddington-concerning-violence-horrible-bosses-2-2001-a-space-odyssey-video-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43yhj\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2200600\"                data-video-name=\"Paddington, Concerning Violence, Horrible Bosses 2 and 2001: A Space Odyssey: Guardian film show – video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169977700/Paddington-Bear-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452743397\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169974735/Paddington-Bear-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington/141127TGFSPaddington.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Paddington, Concerning Violence, Horrible Bosses 2 and 2001: A Space Odyssey: Guardian film show</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In order to create a feature-length storyline for Paddington, writer-director Paul King (who shares the story credits with Hamish McColl), created an arc – and a villain – that are not to be found in the source material. Having successfully done so, Paddington is in great shape for further film adventures, with another freshly created storyline peppered with comic misadventures drawn from, or inspired by, Bond’s text. Discussions with the film’s producer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/24/david-heyman-film-power-100\">David Heyman</a> (Harry Potter franchise) are presumably already under way.</p> <p>The arrival of Paddington proved predictably detrimental to Nativity 3: Dude, Where’s My Donkey?!, which fell 49%. After three weekends of play, the festive sequel stands at £4.65m, which compares with £4.38m for predecessor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150688/nativity-2\">Danger in the Manger</a> after the same amount of play.

Lionsgate probably isn’t panicking. Eleven-day receipts of £21.25m compare very equivalently with £21.71m for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire\">Catching Fire</a> at the same stage of its run, and the film has another whole week of relatively little competition until it gets clobbered on 12 December by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/01/the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-review-film-peter-jackson\">The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</a>.</p> <p>To beat Catching Fire, Mockingjay needs to reach £34.1m. To match The Lego Movie as the biggest film of the year so far, its target is £34.3m. Having dropped by 52% from its opening weekend, signs currently are that it will just fall short of those goals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/26/jennifer-aniston-horrible-bosses-2-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43j5p\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2198824\"                data-video-name=\"Jennifer Aniston on Horrible Bosses 2: 'I loved playing someone so twisted' – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933386241/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452595484\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933365269/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses/141125HorribleBosses.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <h2>The comedy alternative</h2> <p>It’s been a while since there’s been a Hollywood comedy on release: the last one was the little-loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sex-tape\">Sex Tape</a>, in early September. Horrible Bosses 2 consequently had a clear run at adult audiences looking for comedy fare, and distributor Warners may be slightly disappointed with an opening weekend of £1.26m. The original <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142717/horrible-bosses\">Horrible Bosses</a> began with £2.08m in July 2011, eventually reaching £10.48m.</p> <p>With sequels, the audience tends to be more front-loaded, as fans of the original film rush out to see the follow-up. For that reason, you wouldn’t expect Horrible Bosses 2 to achieve a lifetime box-office that is five times its opening weekend, as the first one did. A final total around £5m looks more likely. The conclusion would seem to be that lots of people enjoyed the first Horrible Bosses film, but weren’t necessarily eagerly anticipating a second one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJo29XoIt94\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJo29XoIt94?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The plucky contender</h2> <p>Many films face the challenge of addressing both a core market and a broader audience: how do you fine-tune your marketing campaign so it effectively targets both groups? With Kajaki: The True Story – a virtual reconstruction of real-life events experienced by British soldiers in the Kajaki valley, Afghanistan, in 2006 – that challenge was particularly acute. Ideally, a film’s audiences are overlapping or adjacent. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/27/kajaki-the-true-story-review-afghan-war-film\">Kajaki</a> could be positioned as a well-reviewed, gritty true tale from a first-time director and a relatively unknown cast, targeted at upscale viewers willing to investigate challenging fare. Or it could be directed squarely at British soldiers, former soldiers, their family members and sympathetic friends – a market that his been ill-served by feature films unapologetically celebrating the courage of British forces in Middle East conflict zones. Those two audiences are far from overlapping or adjacent; in fact, they’re quite far apart.</p> <p>In the end, the producers of Kajaki, who are self-distributing the film, opted to focus principally on the latter with their marketing materials. The strategy made sense, given the decision had already been made to release the film with an exclusive two-week run at Vue cinemas nationwide. The tagline “For Queen. For country. For your mates” suggested engagement of an audience sympathetic to British soldiers, if not necessarily to the British military project in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The outcome – £55,000 from 81 cinemas – feels a little underwhelming, although it’s worth bearing in mind that only 34 venues played it for all showtimes, with the remainder offering one or two slots a day. Despite working with military charities, including Walking with the Wounded and Help for Heroes, Kajaki doesn’t seem to have energised its soldier/former-soldier base in sufficient numbers. Kajaki’s backers report that the film played particularly well in Vue West End, where it came second to Paddington, and also in Portsmouth, Edinburgh Omni and Basingstoke.</p> <p>Whether the film could more successfully engage its twin potential audiences with a mix of multiplex and arthouse venues is a question that may yet be answered. The exclusive Vue run ends on 11 December, which means other cinemas will then be able to book the title – if they have room on their screens to give it a punt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/mar/28/frozen-deleted-scene-disney-animation-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3zv8x\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2066932\"                data-video-name=\"Frozen: a deleted scene from the Oscar-winning Disney animation – video\"                data-video-provider=\"Disney\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/27/1395934354142/Still-image-from-Frozen-d-013.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-433145974\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/27/1395934351600/Still-image-from-Frozen-d-011.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/27/140331Frozen-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/27//140331Frozen.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/27/140331Frozen/140331Frozen.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/27/140331Frozen_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/27/140331Frozen_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Frozen: a deleted scene from the Oscar-winning Disney animation</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The reissues</h2> <p>Nearly a year after its release, Frozen is back in the chart for a festive reissue, adding another £178,000 at the weekend, and taking the tally so far to a spiffy £40.96m.

Much of this was from the Hockney Live from LA event on 25 November, which presented the film together with a live Q&amp;A with subject David Hockney. With the documentary space increasingly cluttered in cinemas with a confusing array of choices, it is becoming ever more necessary to make an event of a documentary film’s release.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q75gwePUlh0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q75gwePUlh0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The future</h2> <p>With the arrival of Paddington and continued success for Mockingjay, grosses are a welcome 32% up on the equivalent frame from 2013, when Catching Fire and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity\">Gravity</a> remained in the top positions, and animation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/free-birds\">Free Birds</a> was the best-performing new release.

Yet like last year’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/nebraska\">Nebraska</a>, it feels too delicate for such sausage-paws – an eclair in the bearpit, a diamond in the mud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/mar/07/grand-budapest-hotel-300-rise-empire-invisible-war-video-review\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3nbeq\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2055455\"                data-video-name=\"The Guardian Film Show: The Grand Budapest Hotel; 300: Rise of an Empire; The Invisible War – video review\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-431480329\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391708359326/The-Grand-Budapest-Hotel-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/06//140306FilmShow.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow/140306FilmShow.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>But it’s this resistance to being lumped in with the others which makes it stand out; its significance – like the lapel badge sported by members of the <a href=\"http://pushkinpress.com/book/the-society-of-the-crossed-keys/\">Society of the Crossed Keys</a> – only discernible by the specially refined. </p> <p>Structurally alone, it’s a doozy. The script (discreetly filthy, a second watch confirms) a teetering stack of digressions and diversions, each fresh layer exposing a new Faberge egg beneath. It is fine-tuned yet casual, a perfect confection.<br /></p> <p>Its biggest reveal is its simplest: Ralph Fiennes can be funny. Really funny. As legendary concierge M Gustav (a part originally earmarked for Johnny Depp) he is camp, nimble, precise as a kitten and much more cute. His <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/03/travelling-light-grand-budapest-hotel-wes-anderson\">fondness for Leonard Rossiter </a>finds full expression in some of the sideways glances and quick skips here. Gustav is irresistible; Fiennes the best he’s ever been.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7616ed67b93df0edf05f69e7950628344d98c31\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417528993632/e5338743-d01b-4f36-82ce-f7573acab4a3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the appeal of the Grand Budapest also lies in it acting as an antidote to Anderson’s other movies: films about the minted and flippant, fairytale boards in which players trade quirks. Grand Budapest’s models may be only a meter or so high, but this is in many ways the most gritty manifesto he’s ever made. These people are battling fascism, as well as four-star customer service. The bereavement suffered by one is real and tearing. We see the hotel itself not just in its glory years, but at a time of brutalism, too. Such bookending means that the meat of the movie can justifiably be regarded as nostalgia, not indulgence.<br /></p> <p>Anderson’s previous signature dish was brattishness served sentimental. Here he delivers something quite different: a splendid defence of preciousness and etiquette, a rallying cry for the importance of aesthetics even in prison, even in exile. It is stirring stuff, feeling beneath the genteel. <br /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/dec/01/10-best-films-2014-the-lego-movie\">• No 10: The Lego Movie</a></p> <p><strong>Which film has topped your own list?

Timothy Spall was named best actor for his turn as British painter JMW Turner in Mike Leigh biopic Mr Turner, while Marion Cotillard won best actress for her performances in harrowing James Gray period drama The Immigrant and the Dardenne brothers’ Cannes hit Two Days, One Night. Veteran US character actor JK Simmons won best supporting actor for his turn as a fearsome jazz teacher in Damien Chazelle’s Whiplash. <br />Meanwhile, Paweł Pawlikowski’s 1960s-set drama Ida won best foreign film and The Lego Movie took best animated film.

After discovering a mysterious new story book on the shelves of her six-year-old son’s bedroom wall, she comes to believe that his visions of a sinister fairytale monster – the relentless Babadook – may be real.</p> <p>Friedkin’s intervention is not the only sign that Kent’s debut feature may be moving out from under the radar, and perhaps even towards a late run for awards season contention. It was named best first film at the New York Film Critics Circle awards on 2 December and has also picked up a number of festival awards.</p>","headline":"The Babadook is the scariest film I’ve ever seen, says Exorcist director","trailText":"William Friedkin offers to host a screening of Jennifer Kent’s fairytale horror","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/12/2/1417518095643/The-Babadook-004.jpg","wordcount":"329","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Child","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-09T10:53:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/02/the-babadook-scariest-film-exorcist-william-friedkin","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/02/the-babadook-scariest-film-exorcist-william-friedkin","tags":[{"id":"film/the-babadook","webTitle":"The Babadook","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-babadook","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/the-babadook","references":[]},{"id":"film/horror","webTitle":"Horror","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horror","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/horror","references":[]},{"id":"film/william-friedkin","webTitle":"William Friedkin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/william-friedkin","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/william-friedkin","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/the-exorcist","webTitle":"The Exorcist","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-exorcist","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/the-exorcist","references":[]},{"id":"film/psycho","webTitle":"Psycho","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/psycho","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/psycho","references":[]},{"id":"film/alien","webTitle":"Alien","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/alien","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/alien","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benchild","webTitle":"Ben Child","r2ContributorId":"24984","firstName":"ben","lastName":"child","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Child is a journalist, DJ and producer whose main interests lie in the worlds of film and music</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/benchild","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benchild","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"470610a7b4507087db4db46bb475860aab38505d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/12/2/1417518100934/The-Babadook-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/12/2/1417518100934/The-Babadook-009.jpg","source":"Sportsphoto Ltd","photographer":"Allstar/Icon Film Distribution","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"The Babadook","suppliersReference":"ENT_SAL44101","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Allstar/Icon Film Distribution/Sportsphoto Ltd","caption":"Scariest movie ever? … The Babadook.

I have kept that voice, because it’s now my trademark,” he told Wire.</p> <p>“Before I lost my voice, it was slurred, so only those close to me could understand, but with the computer voice, I found I could give popular lectures.</p> <p>“I enjoy communicating science. It is important that the public understands basic science, if they are not to leave vital decisions to others.”</p> <p>The full interview with Hawking, 72, is in the January issue of Wired magazine,

major films such as Fury, Mr Turner and the forthcoming Annie remake, the FBI is aiding Sony Pictures in investigating the perpetrators – possibly a group operating on behalf of North Korea. </p> <p>“The targeting of public and private sector computer networks remains a significant threat, and the FBI will continue to identify, pursue and defeat individuals and groups who pose a threat in cyberspace,” said the bureau <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/fbi-leading-probe-into-sony-pictures-hacking-incident-1201368110/\">in a statement</a>. Sony has also hired private security firm FireEye to investigate the hack.</p> <p>The hackers are dubbing themselves #GOP, or Guardians of Peace, and threatened to leak Sony’s “secrets and top secrets”. Tech site recode.net has written that it could be the work of Chinese hackers working on behalf of North Korea, while anonymous sources <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/more-signs-north-korea-may-be-behind-hacking-of-sony-pictures-1417467267\">speaking to the Wall Street Journal</a> said that the tools used in the hacks were “very similar” to those used against South Korean TV stations last year, in attacks blamed on North Korea. </p> <p>As well as the leaks and hacks of Sony Twitter accounts, a spreadsheet purporting to show the salaries of top execs <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2014/12/sony-hacker-executive-salaries-michael-lynton-amy-pascal-1201305434/\">was posted online</a>. The company was also left without email and other internal systems, which have since recovered.</p> <p>It’s been mooted that the attacks could be in retaliation against The Interview, a forthcoming comedy from Seth Rogen and James Franco about an assassination attempt on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un\">Kim Jong-un</a> by the US. The film has been strongly condemned by North Korea’s UN ambassador Ja Song Nam, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/10/north-korea-un-the-interview-seth-rogen-james-franco\">called it</a> “the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war”.</p>","headline":"FBI joins probe into possible North Korea hack of Sony Pictures","trailText":"<strong>News:</strong> A group of US law enforcement agencies are looking into the hack that resulted in films including Fury, Annie and Mr Turner being illegally uploaded online","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417507706578/bbdfce0e-f695-4947-96a2-0f159962944d-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"267","commentable":"true","byline":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T08:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/02/fbi-probe-north-korea-hack-sony-pictures","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/02/fbi-probe-north-korea-hack-sony-pictures","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/sony-pictures","webTitle":"Sony Pictures","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sony-pictures","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/sony-pictures","references":[]},{"id":"world/north-korea","webTitle":"North Korea","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/north-korea","references":[]},{"id":"film/fury","webTitle":"Fury","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fury","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/fury","references":[]},{"id":"film/mr-turner","webTitle":"Mr Turner","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mr-turner","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mr-turner","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/ben-beaumont-thomas","webTitle":"Ben Beaumont-Thomas","r2ContributorId":"31786","firstName":"ben","lastName":"beaumont-thomas","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Ben Beaumont-Thomas is currently Acting Culture Editor of The Guardian.

The troll, or whatever it is, lies full length on the ground, stunned; entirely disregarded as its compadres swarm past. Well, I can sympathise entirely; I reeled out of the cinema in bit of a daze myself after this extended dose of Jackson’s patented ye olde Middle Earth cranium-smashing.<br /></p> <p>The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies promises to be the New Zealand director’s final excursion into Tolkien territory, and for that some praise is due, for staying the course if nothing else. The first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, was released almost exactly 13 years ago, in 2001, and the six instalments of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies make up a remarkably homogenous body of work. Like Agatha Christie’s detective novels, there would appear little in the way of aesthetic – as opposed to technological – progression; having set the tone so definitively at the outset, each film delivered exactly what it promised. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/29/hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-trailer-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4vbba\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2134090\"                data-video-name=\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies: watch the teaser trailer - video\"                data-video-provider=\"Warner Bros\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/29/1406649695456/The-Hobbit-The-Battle-of--017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-443296405\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/29/1406649679470/The-Hobbit-The-Battle-of--007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit/140729Hobbit.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>That’s not to say Jackson’s achievement hasn’t been impressive: the epic potential of The Lord of the Rings was perhaps simple enough to spot, but a monumental effort to pull off. Applying the same thunderous template to the chirpy Hobbit, however, required adroit footwork to avoid the feeling that the whole thing had been padded out. Well, the pace doesn’t flag in this final section, even if it’s shorter by almost 20 minutes than either of its two predecessors; however, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/29/hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-trailer-video\">the late-breaking change of title</a> (from the considerably more fey There and Back Again) tells you that heading towards some sort of monumental showdown is this film’s central preoccupation.</p> <p>The Battle of the Five Armies picks up where Desolation of Smaug leaves off, practically in mid-sentence. The dragon is hurtling down towards the watery hovels of Laketown, Thorin Oakenshield is getting a little twitchy down in the treasure hoard, and Gandalf is swinging gently in the breeze in an iron cage in Sauron’s ruined castle. Almost immediately, we are plunged into a hellstorm of grandiose proportions, as Smaug lays down an impressively methodical carpet-fire-breathing assault, laying waste to Laketown and forcing the inhabitants to flee, until taken out by iron-arrowed Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans). Thorin (played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/02/richard-armitage-the-crucible-old-vic-cinema-digital-theatre\">Richard Armitage</a>), meanwhile, is succumbing to what is fetchingly termed “dragon sickness” – a saucer-eyed hunger for gold that causes him to lose his Braveheart-ish dignity and sense of honour. Another of the myriad concurrent plot strands sees Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee and Hugo Weaving turn up like some kind of smocked-and-gowned superhero team to see off Sauron, with director Jackson indulging in unexpectedly trippy Doctor Who-ish visuals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e8cc3fea031751266407bf55e4fd4b6bf3cd782\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/1/1417459809815/86095ad2-dcbf-40f6-898d-510ffac7ab1c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Hobbit Battle of the Five Armies film still\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As for Bilbo Baggins – well, he doesn’t have a whole lot to do. Martin Freeman is as likeably careworn as ever in the part, but as Jackson shuffles and prods events towards the gargantuan confrontation signalled from the outset, it is evident that Thorin is the film’s pivotal character, and the one with the most repeatedly inspected “journey”. Bilbo has a couple of errands to run, a ring to fiddle about with, but not much else – and certainly not much in the way of fighting. Jackson, for understandable reasons, has concentrated his cinematic fire on the clang of swordplay and the roar of battle; this consigns Bilbo to a peripheral role throughout. Of course, and I don’t think this is too much of a spoiler, his return to the Shire is calibrated for maximum heartstring-tugging, as well as one or two bits of business to close the loop to the Lord of the Rings movies.</p> <p>Be that as it may, this film is a fitting cap to an extended series that, if nothing else, has transformed Tolkien’s place in the wider culture. His books were once strictly for spotty teen nerds (I think we’ve all been there), and while The Battle of the Five Armies is unlikely to repeat the Oscar sweep that greeted the conclusion of Jackson’s first Tolkien trilogy, in truth it is just as enjoyable as each of the five films that came before it. Jackson may or may not be resigned to the fact that, unless something very dramatic emerges, they will be his principal cinematic legacy – his pre-Rings eccentricity having been thoroughly eclipsed – but at least he can take a bit of time off. He’s earned it.</p>","headline":"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies review - exactly what it promised to be","trailText":"<strong>Andrew Pulver: </strong>The final section of Peter Jackson’s
