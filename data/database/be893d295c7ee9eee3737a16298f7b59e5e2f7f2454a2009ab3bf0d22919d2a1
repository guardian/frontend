The government would then need to refinance (and probably recapitalise) the banking system by creating a new currency to do so. However, this could probably be slowed with the imposition of capital controls limiting deposit withdrawal.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>(2) The slow(er) route:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government, running out of funds, could substitute IOUs for euros in some of its payments. Starting with payments to suppliers (including for pharmaceuticals, as in 2011), and then - in theory - progressing on to public sector salaries and pensions over time. As current Greek debt obligations are not valued at their face value by the bond market, nor would these notes be, meaning that their purchasing power would likely be lower than that of the euro. In this way, the parallel currency would already be devalued. </p> <p>The more of these notes that were issued, the greater the need would be for the banking system to clear payments in them. The need would also increase for businesses and citizens to use them to pay taxes. As this continued, it would be likely that more euros would leak out of the Greek banking system and the economy would rely on the new currency to a greater extent. </p> <p>Nominally, Greece could (in theory, and just conceivably) remain in the euro under these circumstances, but there would come a point in this process at which it had in a practical sense already left. </p> </blockquote> <p>They’ve also produced a chart, showing the consequences of Greece missing various payments:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a76bee5dd8483ed7d016d4d5d39bc825ef09b073\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430137669654/3bb8324e-802c-442a-bf0e-bdc0489dbc23-460x346.png\" alt=\"Greek default scenarios\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek default scenarios</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UBS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553e29b3e4b02b6ca8a6373a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T13:22:03.251+01:00\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The word in Athens is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/27/greek-finance-minister-debt-talks-eurozone-live#block-553e0700e4b040bad389a33d\">the reshuffled Greek negotiating team</a> will meet tonight, at 6.30pm local time or 4.30pm BST. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/statuses/592663887809482752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> negotiating team is convening at 6.30 pm, according to local media <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politics?src=hash\">#politics</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash\">#economy</a></p>&mdash; Manos Giakoumis (@ManosGiakoumis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/592663887809482752\">April 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553e2608e4b0f1a3d74a8759\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T13:12:24.881+01:00\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Life has been continuing as normal in Athens today, despite growing public concerns over the negotiations with creditors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24bef5b0f364a17d10b9acb1df19f7f291b8c2c3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/24bef5b0f364a17d10b9acb1df19f7f291b8c2c3/0_111_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man looks at fruits and vegetables at the Athens main market on April 27, 2015.

Encouraged by Messrs Juncker, Draghi, Moscovici and Ms Lagarde, he is playing the game to avoid Grexit. In his post-meeting interviews he said “<em>Any mention of a plan B is profoundly anti-European, My immediate response was to say there is no such plan B, there cannot be such a plan B</em>.” </p> <p>However, the Northerners’ game seems more like avoiding getting the blame for Grexit even if they cannot yet agree a Plan B (because of opposition from those encouraging Mr Varoufakis). The Greeks are still holding out for the last €7.2bn tranche from the second bail-out, no more supervision by the lenders and release from most if not all current budgetary and structural reform targets. Once that is out the way, they then will want to talk about a third bail-out.</p> <p>The current stand-off probably means the first crunch date is May 12<sup>th</sup> when a €0.75bn repayment is due to the IMF. Things would move quickly after a default but the exact sequence is unclear. Assuming the Northerners refuse to blink, drachmas would soon be needed to pay suppliers, salaries and pensions. This in turn would necessitate nationalising the banks and introducing exchange controls. Mr Draghi’s nightmare will have come true: EMU would be seen not to be irreversible after all. Then it will be Mr Juncker’s turn: will Greece be able to stay in the EU?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlastairWinter/statuses/592607854873464833\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Wonder if circumventing Varoufakis just another instalment in Northerners trying to escape blame for Grexit while Greece trying to avoid it?</p>&mdash; Alastair Winter (@AlastairWinter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlastairWinter/status/592607854873464833\">April 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553df7cae4b006cad0a26a5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T09:49:27.310+01:00\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good news for readers whose grasp of Greek is as poor as mine; Enikos will translating Alexis Tsipras’s interview tonight into English (from 9.30pm UK time, I think)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/enikos_en/statuses/592610027632009216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/graemewearden\">@graemewearden</a> Simultaneous translation into English for Alexis <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tsipras?src=hash\">#Tsipras</a> first live interview -<a href=\"http://t.co/0PrAT10q83\">http://t.co/0PrAT10q83</a></p>&mdash; enikos_en (@enikos_en) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/enikos_en/status/592610027632009216\">April 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553df445e4b040bad389a328\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T09:42:56.178+01:00\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"06f3229694c218f6ab1918f046c6a8b9df77a2e6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/06f3229694c218f6ab1918f046c6a8b9df77a2e6/2_234_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"epa04718854 President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem attends the press conference of the Informal Meeting of Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) in Riga, Latvia, 24 April 2015.
