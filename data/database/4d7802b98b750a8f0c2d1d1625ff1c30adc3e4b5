Please post your comments below.</p> <p>Here's a roundup of the latest developments:</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/09/30/uk-syria-crisis-inspectors-idUKBRE98T0J420130930\"><strong>An international team of chemical weapons experts is due to arrive in Damascus on Tuesday under the mandate of last week's UN security council resolution calling for the dismantling of Syria's large arsenal.</strong></a> A separate UN team investigating alleged chemical attacks left Syria on Monday.&nbsp;<br />• <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/139970/amy-e-smithson/a-phony-farewell-to-arms?cid=rss-middle_east-a_phony_farewell_to_arms-000000\"><strong>Bashar al-Assad should not be expected to lay down his chemical arms meekly, warns Amy Smithson, senior fellow at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies.</strong></a> Writing in Foreign Affairs she points out the legal ways the Syrian government can thwart inspectors from the&nbsp;Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW].</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Syria could keep inspectors away from certain areas of production facilities if it declares to the OPCW that those areas have nothing to do with chemical weapons. Syria can also short-circuit inspections by accusing inspectors of interfering with a facility’s regular operations or of jeopardizing its operational safety. Assad could also refuse to turn over records by asserting their irrelevance to his chemical weapons capabilities; he could demand negotiated agreements to govern the terms of inspections at each declared chemical weapons site; he might even have the gall to file a request to convert his poison gas productions facilities into benign factories. Assad is likely to cooperate in some situations but use such tactics in others to foster hope that he is disarming even as he maneuvers to retain a minimal chemical weapons capability -- one that he could draw from in a last-ditch effort to hold on to power.</p> </blockquote> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/syria-western-terrorism-sarin-attack-un\"><strong>Syria has demanded that Arab and western countries end their support of Syrian rebels.</strong></a> In a defiant speech to the general assembly of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a>, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, said Syria was committed to implementing the agreement on the disposal of its chemical weapons. But he added: &quot;There remains the challenge whether those who are supplying terrorists with these types of weapon will abide by their legal commitments, since terrorists, who used poisoned gases in my country, have received chemical agents from regional and Western countries that are well known to all of us.&quot;</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/syrian-jihadists-wreak-havoc-violence-iraq\"><strong>Tribal leaders of Iraq's Anbar province, who helped drive the anti-al-Qaida movement in 2007 known as the awakening, are troubled by resurgence of militant jihadis in northern Syria, writes Martin Chulov.&nbsp;</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The al-Qaida-aligned groups that started mustering in Syria from July 2012 onwards have been consolidating in large swaths of the north and east and spreading out, just as they have been in Anbar and the farmlands north of Baghdad. With their creeping presence has come the enforcement of new ways in the rural north; summary justice, fear and intimidation. There is a sense of lurking danger ...</p> <p>Black flags now fly above many mosques and civic buildings in towns across Syria's north and in Iraq's border towns. Local residents near Aleppo walk silently past school walls with white horses painted on a black background – an image widely used by al-Qaida in the north. &quot;We don't want their paintings, or their jihad,&quot; said Abu Saed, a member of the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo. &quot;They can take the stallion back to the dark past that they came from.&quot;</p> <p>Talk of how to get an awakening under way is now well advanced here, just as it is in the corridors of power in Riyadh, and even Baghdad, where Iraq's prime minister, Nour al-Maliki, is convinced that the jihadist push in Syria is bleeding directly into the rising terror menace he is facing at home.</p> </blockquote> <h2>&nbsp;Iran</h2> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/rouhani-direct-flights-iran-us\"><strong>Iran's moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, has raised the prospect of a restoration of direct flights to the US for the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</strong></a>&nbsp;Rouhani has directed a top presidential aide, Akbar Torkan, to pursue the resumption of Iran-US flights, which stopped 34 years ago when Iranian revolutionary students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days.</p> <p>&nbsp;• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/binyamin-netanyahu-obama-iran-sanctions\"><strong>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, used a visit to the White House on Monday to urge the US president to maintain or even increase sanctions against Iran, despite the promise of progress over Tehran's nuclear programme.</strong></a>&nbsp;&quot;If diplomacy is to work, those pressures must be kept in place,&quot; Netanyahu said of the sanctions, which have proved economically crippling in Iran.</p> <h2>Qatar</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/qatar-crackdown-deaths-world-cup-construction\"><strong>Qatar has promised to crack down on private building companies who exploit migrant workers, following a Guardian investigation that revealed alarming numbers of labourers are dying in the building boom prior to the 2022 World Cup.</strong></a>&nbsp;Qatari labour minister Saleh al-Khulaifi said the Gulf state would recruit more inspectors to mount raids and checks on companies to ensure they comply with labour laws and hire more interpreters to speed up the treatment of complaints from foreign workers.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418708670|2013-10-07T10:05:54Z|4d93837b28e13f75b43c241daa23b6e8322332c8 -->",
