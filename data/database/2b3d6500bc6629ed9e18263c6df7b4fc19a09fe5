It was sheer hell and all I can remember is praying.\"</p><p>She was ordered to open a second safe but was unable to perform the combination.</p><p>As a result, the burglars tied her hands behind her back and made her lie in her bath where a water-drenched towel was wrapped around her face a number of times to simulate drowning.</p><p>Jansen continued: \"Then they tied me to the towel rail with cable they had ripped from a nearby radio. They cut off my trousers and T-shirt with scissors.</p><p>\"I was trembling because I thought they were going to rape me and I just kept praying.</p><p>\"I was semi-conscious but eventually I realised they were gone and I had to bite myself out of the wires to get free.\"</p><p>She managed to raise the alarm but police were unable to locate the men – who are believed to have escaped on foot – following a search of the area.</p><p>Surrey police have appealed for witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to come forward.</p><p>Detective Inspector Jake Nuttall, who is leading the investigation, said: \"This was an appalling, unprovoked attack on a defenceless, elderly woman in her own home and Surrey police is carrying out a thorough and extensive investigation to bring these cowardly offenders to justice.</p><p>\"The victim sustained injuries to her wrists, arms and shoulders during the attack but fortunately she is expected to make a full recovery. She has understandably been left deeply upset by this horrendous ordeal.</p><p>\"This type of senseless violence will not be tolerated and I would urge anyone who may have seen or heard anything out of the ordinary in St George's Hill late on Friday night into the early hours of Saturday morning to call police as a matter of urgency.\"</p><p>Anyone who witnessed the burglary or has any information should call Surrey police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.</p>","headline":"Woman tortured during burglary tells of waterboarding ordeal","trailText":"<p>Francoise Jansen, 73, suffered multiple injuries during robbery at Surrey home in which raiders doused her with boiling water</p>","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/39heg","wordcount":"502","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"394290213","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6513132","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Press Association","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-08T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1784257","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-10T08:56:39Z"},"rights":{},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/07/woman-torture-burglary-waterboard-surrey","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/uk/2012/aug/07/woman-torture-burglary-waterboard-surrey","tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk"},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"uk/ukcrime","webTitle":"Crime","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/uk/ukcrime"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","references":[],"type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-video-394341863","relation":"body","type":"video","assets":[{"type":"video","mimeType":"mp4","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured-16x9.mp4","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","thumbnailImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/thumb/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","height":"360","durationMinutes":"1","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","width":"640","durationSeconds":"18"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/3gpp:small","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_3gpSml16x9.3gp","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","thumbnailImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/thumb/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","height":"360","durationMinutes":"1","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","width":"640","durationSeconds":"18"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/mp4:720","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured-720.mp4","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","thumbnailImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/thumb/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","height":"360","durationMinutes":"1","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","width":"640","durationSeconds":"18"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/m3u8","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120807WomanTortured/120807WomanTortured.m3u8","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","thumbnailImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/thumb/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","height":"360","durationMinutes":"1","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","width":"640","durationSeconds":"18"}},{"type":"video","mimeType":"video/3gpp:large","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_3gpLg16x9.3gp","typeData":{"source":"ITN","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","thumbnailImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/thumb/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","height":"360","durationMinutes":"1","stillImageUrl":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/poster/2012/8/7/120807WomanTortured_6516310.jpg","width":"640","durationSeconds":"18"}}]}]},"storyPackage":[]}}
