campaign for safer cycling in Manchester","authorUsername":"CyclingSarah","caption":"The &#39;suffragettes&#39; cycled through Manchester as part of an event for International Women’s Day, organised by Sustrans and Manchester Bike Tours to highlight the gender imbalance of cycling.\r\n\r\nThe bicycle was a symbol of freedom for the suffragettes, who often attended demonstrations on bikes. Yet today’s research shows there are upto four times as many men who cycle compared to women.\r\n\r\nSustrans’ recent random Bike Life survey of over 4000 people in Greater Manchester found that fears around cycling on the roads was one of the main factors which prevented people cycling.

Schulman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Susan Schulman is an award-winning video/photojournalist. Originally a fine artist, Schulman moved from her native New York to London in 1990 and worked as a filmmaker and editor before turning to photo-journalism full-time in 2000 and video in 2008. During the past 10 years she has chronicled many of the world's forgotten tragedies, from the horrors of childbirth in Sierra Leone and child soldiers in Sudan to the wretched plight of gold miners in the Amazon basin. Through her characteristically frank and humane perspective, she has captured soldiers and citizens caught up in some of the decade's major conflicts, most notably from the frontlines of Iraq, Afghanistan, Darfur, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Her work has been featured in the world's foremost print and visual media, including The New York Times, The Financial Times, The Guardian, Architectural Digest (France), PBS, BBC and Channel Four. She has received numerous commissions from leading international organisations such as the UN High Commission for<br />Refugees, the World Food Programme and Marie Stopes International, as well as Britain's Department for International Development. She was recipient (with Ed Caesar) of Amnesty International UK's coveted media award (2010) for her devastating account of war and suffering in Africa's Great Lakes region, Congo – the Horror, which appeared in GQ magazine</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/4/10/1365588914223/Susan-Schulman-003.jpg","firstName":"susan","lastName":"schulman","r2ContributorId":"43073","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/susan-schulman","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/susan-schulman","references":[]},{"id":"profile/samjones","webTitle":"Sam Jones","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Sam Jones is a reporter for the Guardian.
