Travelling at a speed of 12 miles per second, the rock exploded with the energy of around 500 kilotonnes of TNT, researchers found.</p><p>Directly beneath the meteor's path, the shockwave was powerful enough to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/15/40-russians-hospitalised-after-meteorite-falls\" title=\"\">knock people off their feet</a>. Windows were shattered in more than 3,600 apartment blocks, and a factory roof collapsed.</p><p>In the local library in Yemanzhelinsk, 30 miles away, a statue of Pushkin cracked when it was struck by a blown-out window frame. At least 1,210 people were treated for injuries, most from falling building debris and flying glass.</p><p>At its most intense, the streaking fireball glowed 30 times brighter than the sun, leaving people on the ground below with skin and retinal burns. One resident in Korkino, 18 miles from the point of peak brightness, lost skin from their face after being burned by radiation. The intense heat evaporated three quarters of the meteor. Around four to six tonnes reached the ground as meteorites, representing just 0.05% of the original rock.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-404126585\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2013/2/15/130215MeteorTHISONE-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130215MeteorTHISONE/130215MeteorTHISONE.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/2/15/130215MeteorTHISONE-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/2/15/130215MeteorTHISONE_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/2/15/130215MeteorTHISONE_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>The Chelyabinsk airburst was the largest since Tunguska in 1908, but unlike that and other historic events, the strike was recorded by a full suite of modern technology: satellites photographed the meteor from space; security and personal video cameras filmed the rock's violent path across the sky; and sensors picked up infrasound waves as lumps hit the ground.</p><p>The largest single piece, weighing around 650kg, punched a 7 metre-wide hole in ice 70cm thick on Lake Chebarkul, and was recovered from the lakebed in October.</p><p>An international team of researchers, led by Olga Popova at the Russian Academy of Sciences, visited Chelyabinsk and 50 nearby villages in the weeks after the event to map the extent of the destruction. The shockwave left a trail of damage 55 miles on either side of the rock's trajectory, according to a report in the journal, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642\" title=\"\">Science</a>.</p><p>\"Our goal was to understand all circumstances that resulted in the damaging shockwave that sent over 1,200 people to hospitals in the Chelyabinsk Oblast area that day,\" said Peter Jenniskens at Nasa's Ames Research Centre in California.</p><p>The unforeseen arrival of the meteor and the violence of its impact were a wake-up call, according to Qing-Zhu Yin, an author on the study at the University of California, Davis. \"If humanity does not want to go the way of the dinosaurs, we need to study an event like this in detail,\" he said.</p><p>Further details of the Chelyabinsk strike appear in two reports in the journal Nature. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12671\" title=\"\">The first</a>, led by Jirí Borovicka at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, traces the orbit of the meteor back to another object, known as asteroid 86039. This asteroid has also orbited close to Earth and was probably once part of the same rock as the Chelyabinsk meteor.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12741\" title=\"\">second Nature study</a>, led by Peter Brown at the University of Western Ontario, calculated the energy of the Chelyabinsk airbust at 400 to 600 kilotonnes of TNT, but found that scientists' models for estimating damage from airbursts were off the mark. The glitch in the models means that the number of space rocks with sizes of the order of tens of metres, which pose a threat, may be ten times greater than previously thought.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421837732|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|92f1fcdd451ffa2406a41c654a0366628c07fd3b -->",

Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p><strong>• A meteor or meteors streaked across the sky over Chelyabinsk, Russia on Friday morning, creating a sonic blast on par with an atomic explosion.</strong> Buildings were damaged and glass and doors were blown in. About 1,100 people sought medical treatment, according to the interior ministry, and nearly 50 were hospitalized. The event was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/feb/15/meteorite-explodes-over-russian-urals-live-updates#block-511e2f3195cb419168cb3fd5\">widely documented</a> on video.</p> <p>• <strong>Meanwhile an asteroid passed unusually close to Earth, thrilling sky-watchers but posing no danger.</strong> Astronomers had been tracking the asteroid, 2012 DA14, which came within about 17,200 miles of Earth, closer than some artificial satellites. The asteroid and meteor were unrelated heavenly visitors.</p> <p>• <strong>Astronomers called for better surveillance of the cosmos to identify potentially dangerous ranging objects.</strong> But it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/feb/15/meteorite-explodes-over-russian-urals-live-updates#block-511eaccb95cb419168cb4016\">appeared</a> no weapon could stop an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.</p> <p>•<strong> The Russian Academy of Sciences says the meteor weighed 10 tons and entered the earth’s atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,000mph (54,000kph)</strong> and shattered between 18 and 32 miles above ground.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-511eaccb95cb419168cb4016\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T21:46:51.241Z\">9.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Given that space is clearly capable of pounding us with deadly rocks at any time, many today have wondered, shouldn't we be<strong> doing more to defend ourselves?</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/feb/15/meteorite-explodes-over-russian-urals-live-updates#block-511e5d3695cb419168cb3ffe\">Earlier </a>Stuart Clark made the argument for improved cosmic surveillance, meaning more telescopes to find incoming debris.</p> <p>But what do we do once we find the rocks? Spencer Ackerman has bad news: There's nothing we can do. No known weapons system could take these meteors out. We're basically sitting ducks (&quot;But [space is] usually an incompetent killer, so don’t freak out,&quot; Ackerman <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/russia-meteor/\">writes</a>):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the advanced air defenses that humanity has invested in? The interceptor missile that are (sometimes) able to stop an adversary missile from impacting? The early-warning monitoring systems that are supposed to give humanity enough time to plan a response? They are useless, <em>useless</em> against a meteorite onslaught. Do not believe the stories about the Russians <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-15/exploding-meteor-smashes-windows-injuring-100-in-russia-s-urals.html\">shooting the cosmic rock down</a>.</p> <p>“The reason, simply put, is physics,” explains Brian Weeden of the Secure Earth Foundation, a former captain and missile expert in the <a href=\"http://www.afspc.af.mil/\">U.S. Air Force Space Command</a>. Asteroids orbit the sun like Earth does, and <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/02/asteroid-odds/\">occasionally our orbits intersect</a>, causing the rocks to enter the atmosphere as flaming meteors screaming toward impact. They are not <em>flying</em> like airplanes and missiles that air defenses target. Shooting them will not change their speed or trajectory — at best, a missile impact might change its direction somewhat or shatter it into more pieces.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/russia-meteor/\">Worth a read here</a>. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-511ea57a95cb419168cb4015\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T21:15:38.308Z\">9.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Guardian's Warren Murray picks up on the questions <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/feb/15/meteorite-explodes-over-russian-urals-live-updates#block-511e59ab95cb419168cb3ffc\">we raised earlier</a> about the minutes-long <strong>time lapse</strong> between when the meteor was first sighted and when the first of a <strong>series of booms</strong> was heard.</p> <p>It simply took the sound waves that long to travel the distance to the observer, he writes. And the series of booms is attributable to multiple shock waves created by the meteor(s):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our coverage we've remarked on the fact that the sonic boom in some videos happens a couple of minutes after the meteor passes.</p> <p>This isn't surprising, it just means the camera was at sufficient distance that the sound took a while to reach it. Sound travels at 330m/s, so a three-second delay would mean you're a kilometre away roughly. A 30-second delay, roughly 10km etc. And the thing would have been visible to people and cameras from a long, long way away, even though the size and brightness would have made it seem quite close for many people who were in fact a long way off.</p> <p>Also, a sonic boom doesn't happen at any particular instant or point in time, i.e. when the object first entered the atmosphere or first broke the sound barrier. The shockwave and the boom follows the object along its entire path as long as it's supersonic, so anyone it goes past will hear a boom. That's one reason why international agreement was never reached for the Concorde to fly supersonic across whole continents or populated areas - it would have created huge noise pollution all the way along its supersonic path.</p> <p>Then there's the multiple sonic booms issue. Put simply, a body going supersonic creates multiple shock waves and therefore can make multiple booms: one in front, one behind, plus others potentially. This partly depends on its shape, changes in trajectory etc. The space shuttle was always known for two booms. Also, consider how very loud those booms in Russia would have been, and the fact that echoes off the sides of mountains etc would have in turn travelled a very long way and been heard some time afterwards.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T22:07:19.581Z\">at 10.07pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-511ea310b5796129ac9ecf1f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T21:05:20.242Z\">9.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Phil Plait, author of the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy.html\">Bad Astronomy</a> blog at Slate, participated in a Google+ hangout today in which he explained why today's asteroid near-miss <strong>wasn't really as close</strong> as some folks are saying.</p> <p>Fast-forward to 29:45 to watch Phil use a foam Earth, a lamp and a hunk of real meteorite to explain what happened.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFp5CHepOEw\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PFp5CHepOEw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T21:05:55.320Z\">at 9.05pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-511e9ad4b5796129ac9ecf1d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T20:30:12.789Z\">8.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>NASA captures a <strong>picture of Asteroid</strong> 2012 DA14 and the Eta Carinae Nebula.

Above the Prechistenka Boulevard, surrounded … on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant comet of 1812—the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly—like an arrow piercing the earth—to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.</blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T21:07:24.870Z\">at 9.07pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-511e8f6bb5796129ac9ecf1c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T19:41:32.379Z\">7.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>2012 DA14 has passed the point of nearest proximity and <strong>is moving away</strong> from Earth again, the AP reports from Cape Canaveral, Florida:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The world is safe at least from one asteroid.<br /> A 150-foot (46-meter) cosmic rock hurtled safely past Earth on Friday.<br /> It was the closest known flyby for a rock of its size, passing within 17,000 miles (27,357 kilometers).

Whitman allows himself to dwell on <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/13/travels-of-a-teenage-prince/\">the visit</a> of Prince Albert Edward to New York (&quot;And you would I sing, fair stripling! welcome to you from me, sweet boy of England! ...I know not why, but I loved you...&quot;)</p> <p>Then the poem mentions a &quot;strange huge meteor procession, dazzling and clear, shooting over our heads&quot;:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north, flaring in heaven;</p> <p>Nor the strange huge meteor procession, dazzling and clear, shooting over our heads,&nbsp;</p> <p>(A moment, a moment long, it sail’d its balls of unearthly light over our heads,&nbsp;</p> <p>Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)</p> </blockquote> <p>In time the celestial event Whitman referred to was forgotten, and astronomers, lacking Russian daschcam footage, began wondering just what he had seen. An 1859 &quot;daylight fireball&quot; and the 1833 Leonid meteor shower were contenders, the LA Times <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/05/science/la-sci-whitman-meteor-20100605\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Then, in 2000, astronomer Don Olson was looking at an art book and saw this painting by Frederic Edwin Church. It's called The Meteor of 1860:</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2a3a6b41-48c6-4645-977d-cfc5e3423fcb\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/15/1360953511466/-460x261.jpeg\" alt=\"Frederic Church\" width=\"460\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Frederic Edwin Church, &quot;The Meteor of 1860.&quot;</figcaption> </figure> <p>Olson realized that here was the event to which Whitman was referring. He drew together a team of astronomers and a literary scholar from Texas State University, and in 2010 they published their results in Sky and Telescope magazine.</p> <p>The Times' Amina Khan <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/05/science/la-sci-whitman-meteor-20100605\">explains</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The astronomer recognized this as an extremely rare event that is in fact called a &quot;meteor procession,&quot; in which a meteor breaks up and the pieces travel together as if in formation before exiting the Earth's atmosphere once more.</p> <p>A procession is rare, Olson said, because so many factors need to fall into place. The meteor, known as a grazer, must travel almost tangent to the Earth's surface, giving it a long, near-horizontal path across the skies. It usually has to travel between about 35 and 40 miles above the ground — any higher and it would not light up, any lower and it would likely fall to Earth. And it has to break up very soon after entering the Earth's atmosphere, or the procession-like effect will be lost.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T19:18:04.544Z\">at 7.18pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-511e7b7c95cb419168cb400f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T18:16:28.332Z\">6.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Russian interior ministry now says about <strong>1,100 sought care</strong> after the meteor blast, the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iqGCl0po0GoL_s_V--gyaSfJxSrw?docId=6ca527bc2e604c64b494aaf832af5015\">AP reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The shock wave blew in an estimated 100,000 square meters (more than 1 million square feet) of glass, according to city officials, who said 3,000 buildings in the city were damaged.

I would say it’s more likely that they’re unrelated than related.</p> </blockquote> <p>I’m getting some criticism on Twitter for calling them meteorites rather than meteors.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joannejacobs/status/302369694579556352\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian\">guardian</a> @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/paultowen\">paultowen</a> didn't make it to ground.

It made a sonic boom in the atmosphere, and that hit buildings and shattered windows. That is what seems to have caused the injuries.</p> <p>It's a completely abnormal experience. This thing appeared in the distance, raced over the horizon and was followed up 30 seconds or a minute later by a huge boom as the shock wave hit the ground. I can imagine that would be very frightening.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, the damage to the roof of the&nbsp;Chelyabinsk Zinc Plant (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/feb/15/meteorite-explodes-over-russian-urals-live-updates#block-511e06b695cb419168cb3fb4\">see earlier</a>) seems inconsistent with a shockwave. I just spoke to Dr Stephen Lowry, planetary scientist at the University of Kent, who said: &quot;It is possible for some fragments to have survived. Larger chunks can make it to the surface [of the earth]. Smaller bits can survive, perhaps bits more dense than others, or buried very deep within the object.&quot;</p> <p>Dr Lowry <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1214659-russian-meteorites-planetary-scientist-dr-stephen-lowry-interviewed-by-guardian-s-paul-owen#t=0m3s\">explained</a> what we are seeing in videos showing objects streaking across the sky, followed a minute or so later by an explosion.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This was probably 10 to 20 metres in diameter, roughly. As the meteor comes in through the atmosphere, it gets heated up, basically by friction, pressure builds up. It has a lot kinetic energy. So there's a lot of energy dissipated at some point, as it gets closer to the surface of the earth. </p> <p>And then at some point they can disrupt, producing shockwaves, so it's the shockwaves that have emanated at some point just above the earth's surface. I don't think that this one actually made it to the surface of the earth. This one exploded just above the earth, which is quite a common phenomenon.</p> </blockquote> <p>Was there any connection between the meteorites and the asteroid due to pass earth this evening?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Certainly when I read about this this morning I couldn't help but try to make a connection to this. But when you look a bit closer, bear in mind that 2012 DA14 [the asteroid] actually approached the vicinity of earth from the south. Now this [the meteorites] struck Russia, which of course is in the northern hemisphere, so it is extremely unlikely to be able to connect the two things.</p> <p>But I would be very curious to see what the original trajectory of this meteor was. Just to see precisely where it came from. But I do stress at this stage, I want to be cautious and say there is no connection at this point.</p> <p>But, having said that, it is an incredible conincidence. </p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-511e1165b5796129ac9eced5\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-02-15T10:43:49.082Z\">10.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck University was just interviewed about the meteorites on Sky News.</p> <p>He said it was too early to tell if this incident was connected to the asteroid passing by the earth tonight.</p> <p>He pointed out that if these meteorites were travelling with the asteroid, they would be many hours ahead of it.</p> <p>But he said there was so much video footage coming out of Russia that it would be &quot;possible to reconstruct the orbit&quot; and work out if the meteorite and asteroid 2012 DA14 were connected.

Demand from international collectors is such that a tiny fragment of the meteorite could fetch hundreds of dollars. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2280416/PICTURED-First-fragments-meteorite-exploded-Russian-city--tests-DID-come-space.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">Reports have already surfaced</a> on Russian websites of pieces being offered for sale for as much as £6,500.</p><p>But how do you tell that what you are buying is a genuine meteorite and not, say, a piece of painted concrete?</p><p>\"The first thing to look for is the 'fusion crust',\" says <a href=\"http://www.nataliestarkey.com/\" title=\"\">Dr Natalie Starkey</a>, a cosmochemist at the Open University who specialises in the study of meteorites. \"Think of what the crust on baked bread looks like. The exterior of the meteorite will be shiny, smooth and black. The heat generated by entering our atmosphere causes the rock's exterior to melt like glass. This appearance is a good indicator that it's a meteorite, but, sadly, it isn't definitive. Ultimately, it will need forensic examination by an expert.\"</p><p>The British and Irish Meteorite Society <a href=\"http://www.bimsociety.org/meteorites10.shtml\" title=\"\">warns on its website</a> that there are a \"few unscrupulous salespeople around who may be selling terrestrial rocks as meteorites\". It advises to first do your homework about the various types of meteorites and then to only buy from a reputable dealer, ideally one that is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.imca.cc/\" title=\"\">International Meteorite Collectors Association</a>. It adds: \"<a href=\"http://meteorite-identification.com/\" title=\"\">Meteorite-Identification.com</a> is a good source of information on suspect eBay auctions.\"</p><p>\"The only way to tell for sure is to look at the specimen under a microscope,\" says Starkey. \"Some minerals, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotite\" title=\"\">biotite</a>, only form on Earth. A specialist will be able to identify those and then rule out whether it's a meteorite. The only truly definitive test, though, is to examine the specimen for oxygen isotopes. Anything that originated on earth will fall within a particular range of isotopes. Anything outside this range will mean it is extra-terrestrial in origin.\"</p><p>Starkey says events such as the Chelyabinsk meteorite are rare and only occur once a year, on average. It is near-unique, though, that its descent was captured on camera. This will only add to the price of any fragments offered for sale, she says: \"It appears to be a fairly normal meteorite from the asteroid belt – what we call an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_chondrite\" title=\"\">ordinary chondrite</a>. If it had originated from Mars, though, it would be far rarer and command an even greater price among collectors. Even so, this will be big business for the meteorite dealers.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/404265299|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|01ca93b574c45200057f992bb022b50800b7e937 -->",

        "headline":"Russian meteorite strike highlights asteroid danger",
        "body":"<p>In terms of human casualties, Friday's meteorite strike is the worst ever reported. Almost <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/feb/15/meteorite-explodes-over-russian-urals-live-updates\">1,000 are reported</a> to have sought treatment after the fall. At least 34 of them were hospitalised, with two reported to be in intensive care.</p><p>Before this there were only stories of a dog being killed in Egypt by a meteorite in 1911 and a boy being hit, but not seriously injured, by one in Uganda in 1992.</p><p>The Russian Academy of Sciences estimate the fireball that streaked over the Ural mountains on Friday morning weighed about 10 tons. The speed of entry was at least 54,000 kilometres per hour (33,000 mph) and it shattered about 30-50 kilometres (18-32 miles) above ground, showering meteorites that caused damage over a wide area. </p><p>The shockwave from the fireball's supersonic passage through the atmosphere broke windows and set off car alarms. The collision took place as the world waited for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/across-the-universe/2013/feb/15/asteroid-2012-da14\">Friday evening's close pass of asteroid 2012 DA14</a>. According to the European Space Agency, no link between the two events is thought possible.</p><p>Until Friday morning, astronomers had thought the asteroid most likely to hit Earth was one called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_VK184\">2007 VK184</a>. It is about 130 metres across and has a slim 1 in 2,000 chance of hitting Earth some time between 2048 and 2057. A danger that is thought will disappear with better tracking of its orbit.</p><p>Friday's unexpected strike highlights the need for better searches for dangerous asteroids, and a global strategy to deal with any that are seen.</p><p>Astronomers feel confident that they know the whereabouts of every asteroid larger than 30 kilometres.  Such space rocks have been the priority because they have the potential to cause global catastrophe and mass extinction events should they hit us. None are known to pose a threat.</p><p>Go down to objects sized one kilometre and astronomers think they know about 90-95% of them. However, at 50 metres, the size of 2012 DA14, the uncertainties really begin.  Astronomers estimate that they know only 2 percent of these. </p><p>There could be hundreds of thousands of these smaller asteroids waiting to be discovered. Were something of this size to strike the Earth, it would devastate an area the size of larger than London.</p><p>On 30 June 1908, something roughly this size hit Earth. It exploded in the air above the Tunguska region of Siberia and flattened forests across an area of hundreds of square kilometres. The area is so remote that no one is thought to have been killed by that event.</p><p>The object that struck above the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on Friday morning was smaller still, probably just 10 metres across. Yet, it has injured many hundreds, underlining the danger of space rocks hitting populated areas, </p><p>The European Space Agency is involved in a £6m project to build a special survey telescope to find small asteroids. Known as a Fly-Eye telescope, it works in the same way as an insect's compound eye. </p><p>The telescope will use multiple cameras to build up a full picture of the sky. The first idea to build such a telescope was <a href=\"http://www.unz.org/Pub/LiteraryDigest-1897feb13-00463a02\">published way back in 1897</a> but it proved too difficult with the technology of the 19th century.  Now, a prototype is under construction in Italy. The final telescope could be located on Mt Teide, Tenerife.</p><p>In Hawaii, the <a href=\"http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu/public/\">Pan-STARRS project</a> uses the world's largest digital camera, containing 1,400 Megapixels, to scan the sky for asteroids larger than 300 metres in size. That's about six times larger than 2012 DA14, and 30 times larger than Friday's Russian meteor. Such asteroids would be capable of devastating whole regions of a country were they to hit Earth.</p><p>Deciding what to do if a dangerous asteroid is spotted falls first to the <a href=\"http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/COPUOS/copuos.html\">United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space</a>. They are setting up a Space Mission Planning Advisory Group. This will be composed of scientists from NASA, ESA and the world's other space agencies. They will meet annually to assess new ideas of how to deflect dangerous asteroids.</p><p>Should an asteroid be found on a collision course, the group will immediately meet to advise on the best strategy for deflecting it. They will also advise on who has the expertise to build the different parts of the spacecraft, and who should pay for it. Then, the decision passes into the hands of the politicians.</p><p>But as Friday's sudden strike shows, asteroids that approach from \"out of the Sun\" are virtually impossible to see. They are hidden from our sight by the glare until they smash into our atmosphere.</p><p>From space, thankfully, it is a different story. Space telescopes can see much closer to the Sun because they do not have the Earth's atmosphere scattering the sunlight and blurring their vision. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission, which launches later this year, could help us see into this <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=29787\">asteroid blind spot</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com\">Stuart Clark</a> is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846972478\">The Day Without Yesterday</a> (Polygon).</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/404153078|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|cf322a7d657ae8d35e5e5c82a86dc85fe4c3a1b5 -->",

The shockwave left a trail of damage 55 miles on either side of the rock's trajectory, according to a report in the journal, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1242642\" title=\"\">Science</a>.</p><p>\"Our goal was to understand all circumstances that resulted in the damaging shockwave that sent over 1,200 people to hospitals in the Chelyabinsk Oblast area that day,\" said Peter Jenniskens at Nasa's Ames Research Centre in California.</p><p>The unforeseen arrival of the meteor and the violence of its impact were a wake-up call, according to Qing-Zhu Yin, an author on the study at the University of California, Davis. \"If humanity does not want to go the way of the dinosaurs, we need to study an event like this in detail,\" he said.</p><p>Further details of the Chelyabinsk strike appear in two reports in the journal Nature. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12671\" title=\"\">The first</a>, led by Jirí Borovicka at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, traces the orbit of the meteor back to another object, known as asteroid 86039. This asteroid has also orbited close to Earth and was probably once part of the same rock as the Chelyabinsk meteor.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature12741\" title=\"\">second Nature study</a>, led by Peter Brown at the University of Western Ontario, calculated the energy of the Chelyabinsk airbust at 400 to 600 kilotonnes of TNT, but found that scientists' models for estimating damage from airbursts were off the mark. The glitch in the models means that the number of space rocks with sizes of the order of tens of metres, which pose a threat, may be ten times greater than previously thought.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421837732|2013-11-11T15:34:05Z|92f1fcdd451ffa2406a41c654a0366628c07fd3b -->",
