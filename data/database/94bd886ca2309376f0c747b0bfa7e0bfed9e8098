        "headline":"Ghosts; The Lyons; Perfect Match; Virgin – review",
        "body":"<p>Richard Eyre's <a href=\"http://www.almeida.co.uk/event/ghosts\" title=\"\"><strong>Ghosts</strong> </a>hammers at the heart. Shouldn't that, you cry, be Henrik Ibsen's <em>Ghosts</em>? Well, no. I have more often been disturbed and impressed by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSb3IFpwLvs\" title=\"\"><em>Ghosts</em></a> than truly moved.</p><p>The reach of this 1881 play is extraordinary: inheritance, venereal disease, euthanasia, conflagration, snobbery, feminism. The ferocity with which it attacks not only turpitude but misplaced ideals about marriage and loyalty is tremendous. Bernard Shaw put his finger on it when he said that <em>Ghosts</em> showed the 19th century loathing itself. In a mighty couple of hours, Ibsen once again gave drama a shove into the next century and beyond.</p><p>Yet Eyre's production is above all profoundly intimate, proving with intensity the stranglehold the past can exert. It is immediately evident that this will be a staging of great suggestiveness as well as resonance. Tim Hatley's design and Peter Mumford's lighting create a solidly realistic drawing&nbsp;room set against a fluid, glimmering, constantly changing background. Shadows and faint figures are glimpsed through transparent screens; a portrait, presumably of the patriarchal ogre, floats like a fly in amber. Ghosts are there from the beginning. The walls flush with fire and close in darkly on the characters.</p><p>The action moves at a 21st-century lick. Events arrive with the shock of a thriller. \"Oh no,\" cried out a young American teacher, new to the play and riven by one terrible irony. Yet there is also stillness and patience – not least in the central performance of Lesley Manville. She holds herself as if she were made of porcelain, barely gesturing, until she finally fractures and shatters. Will Keen, at his best when least emphatic as the love-quenching pastor, does wonderful work with his terrible zealot eyes. It's not only that he transfixes with his mad gaze. He cleverly does the opposite, dropping his stare when most drawn to someone. As the stricken son, Oswald, who brings back to the house awful suggestions of his father, Jack Lowden transmits a powerfully physical sense of his condition, moving from a dreadful torpor to an anguished writhing.</p><p>Eyre has written his own new version of the play, based on a literal translation by Charlotte Barslund. Its clarity and forcefulness are central to the evening's success. It is never over-idiomatic or straining, yet it contains not one stale phrase. Oswald's terror of the future is finely captured in his lament that he is about to turn into \"a grey-haired infant\". A shrewd attention to the speeches of the \"illegitimate\" daughter who is brought up as a maid in her father's house illuminates the horror of her history and makes a tragic heroine of what might be thought a minor part. Well supported by Brian McCardle as her father, Charlene McKenna brings to the part a delicate lack of sentimentality.</p><p>We are living in a period of marvellous productions of Ibsen: one of the highlights of last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/21/carrie-cracknell-dolls-house-interview\" title=\"\">Carrie Cracknell's</a> production of <em>The Doll's House</em>, is about to go to New York. How things have changed since the premiere of <em>Ghosts</em>, when an orgy of critical denunciation proclaimed it as \"garbage and offal\", \"loathsome and fetid\" and the \"maunderings of [useful vocab] nook-shotten Norwegians\".</p><p>It's 16 years since the digital world burst on to the stage in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4puFhktZZzY\" title=\"\"><em>Closer</em></a>. No one who saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/marber\" title=\"\">Patrick Marber</a>'s play will forget the moment when, with the stage dominated by giant computer screens, two characters began to tap out messages to each other. And started&nbsp;to lie about themselves. Their typed-out fibs hung above them like damning headlines.</p><p>The stage is the ideal place to show the gap between what we tweet and mail and who we are. It's sharp of Brigid Larmour, artistic director of Watford Palace, to commission three plays on the subject.</p><p>There is nothing as seismic as that <em>Closer</em> moment in the two opening plays. Not simply because familiarity has taken the edge off surprise, but because in neither play is the staging as well as the subject matter seized by digitisation. Neither contains an episode in which the new technology is seen as well as cited.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419109569'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380818301916/Simon-Darwen-and-Laura-El-010.jpg' alt='Simon Darwen and Laura Elphinstone in Virgin at Watford Palace theatre.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Simon Darwen and Laura Elphinstone in Virgin at Watford Palace theatre. Photograph: Robert Day</figcaption></figure><p>Still, the diversity of the playwrights' approaches makes the case for this mini-season, which is completed by Stacey Gregg's <em>Override</em>. Gary Owen's <a href=\"http://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/page/perfect-match\" title=\"\"><strong>Perfect Match</strong></a> is an accomplished comedy which takes off from technological possibilities (a dating site) rather than exploring them. It's a frothily neat meshing of new subject matter and old format. EV Crowe's <a href=\"http://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/page/virgin\" title=\"\"><strong>Virgin</strong></a> (the hymen is digital) meanders in the middle but looks at the question of what the internet has done for women (often shafting them) with the perspicacity you would expect from this astute young playwright.</p><p>I liked the opening shot (bloke with a book, woman with a laptop). I admired the nimble attacks and the description of the househusband who would not call himself a feminist but looks a bit like one since he \"doesn't know how to be unfair\". I loved watching Laura Elphinstone as a gauche, febrile woman burning herself up with anxiety.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419109570'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380818441303/Nicholas-Day-and-Charlott-010.jpg' alt='Nicholas Day and Charlotte Randle in The Lyons by Nicky Silver at the Menier.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nicholas Day and Charlotte Randle in The Lyons by Nicky Silver at the Menier. Photograph:  Tristram Kenton</figcaption></figure><p>Nicky Silver's <a href=\"https://www.menierchocolatefactory.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=6CE4A8B0-1A2C-4151-8428-E0F0049D9EF1&amp;sessionlanguage=\" title=\"\"><strong>The Lyons</strong></a> was a<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaGyX7G8eA\" title=\"\"> New York hit</a> in 2011. It comes here with the same director, Mark Brokaw, and a British cast doing sterling, or dollar, accent woik, but it looks peaky. Silver has picked and mixed familiar plot ingredients. A family gathers around the deathbed patriarch: cue strife and secrets. One character has a romantic escape. Another is driven to invent a romantic life. The extent of the vitriol is the main surprise, with its nicely turned causticness: \"This cancer is making you very bad-tempered.\"</p><p>The most original scene is a diversion from the play's main family-exploding business. An estate agent shows a young man around a New York apartment. The long skinny stage suddenly seems appropriate, made for people to coil and spring at each other. The duplicity and delusion are lively. Weirdly, it made me wish there were more plays about estate agents.</p><p><em>Star ratings (out of 5):</em><br /><em>Ghosts</em> ★★★★★<br /><em>Perfect Match</em> ★★★<br /><em>Virgin</em> ★★★<br /><em>The Lyons</em> ★★<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991266|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|ca39913776b4cd2dbc1c3d9a8ef407df55abefd7 -->",

        "body":"<p>There is a great drama to be written about Chinese migrant workers quitting the countryside in their millions to power their country's unstoppable economic growth. <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-world-of-extreme-happiness\" title=\"\">This play</a> by the young American dramatist <a href=\"http://francesyachucowhig.com\" title=\"\">Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig</a>, following the picaresque adventures of migrant worker Sunny (Katie Leung), has a good stab at being that drama. Cowhig examines the nasty underside of China's economic boom, taking in everything from female infanticide to the high suicide rates among factory workers, while skewering the self-help-book platitudes that keep so many believing better luck is around the corner.</p><p>Leung, of <em>Harry Potter</em> fame, is very watchable as Sunny, and Chloe Lamford's design, with its dirt-rimmed stage and neon rainbow, offers a dynamic setting. But several of the scenes lack pace, and the characters are one-dimensional. That may well be part of Cowhig's point: that the combined effect of ferocious industrialisation and a repressive regime is to turn workers into living dolls, like the toys churned out by Sunny's factory. But it doesn't make for the most enjoyable two-and-a-half hours of theatre.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419051707|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|75451d8fba824ff62f4fa8aff3332e67bb5349a9 -->",

        "headline":"Don Quixote – review",
        "body":"<p>On the face of it, the decision by the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/about/the-royal-ballet\" title=\"\">Royal Ballet</a> to commission a new production of <em>Don Quixote</em> from <a href=\"http://www.carlosacosta.com/\" title=\"\">Carlos Acosta</a> is a strange one. Neither of the recent stagings – Anthony Dowell's in 1993, Ross Stretton's in 2001 – was a success. With its fantastical plot and nostril-flaring machismo, the ballet just didn't suit the Royal's more decorous house style. Add to this the fact that the company urgently needs a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/14/swan-lake-birmingham-royal-ballet-review\" title=\"\"><em>Swan Lake</em></a> (the current production, now a quarter of a century old, looks desperately tawdry), and the whole project takes on an air of recklessness.</p><p>For all his charisma as a dancer, Acosta is a relatively untried choreographer. Can the Royal really afford to risk mothballing a third <em>Don Quixote</em> in 20 years? Director Kevin O'Hare clearly thinks so. On Monday's gala opening night, the Royal Opera House was bravely festooned with red carnations; armfuls more would be showered on the principal couple, Acosta and <a href=\"http://www.marianelanunez.com/\" title=\"\">Marianela Nuñez</a>, as they took their curtain calls.</p><p>One of Acosta's cleverest plot changes is to introduce Dulcinea (Christina Arestis) in the prologue, much improving this usually rather musty scene, and providing Don Quixote (Christopher Saunders) with both inspiration and motivation. From the Don's cramped attic, we proceed to the town square and get our first real look at <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0368946/\" title=\"\">Tim Hatley's</a> designs. These are attractive enough, if at times more reminiscent of an upscale timeshare development than 17th-century La Mancha. Disconcertingly, the houses move, gliding around the stage and confusing the choreographic perspective.</p><p>Although well danced, Act 1 is structurally problematic. There's some sketchy scene-setting by yawning townsfolk and then we're suddenly into full-tilt solos and duets from Basilio (Acosta) and Kitri (Nuñez). It's too abrupt and the balletic language is insufficiently established. That said, Acosta is in fine, streamlined form and Nuñez, as delicately flirtatious as she is airily commanding, is a joy to behold. But their relationship is inert. He's forever larking around, she's forever pretending to be exasperated and then forgiving him. The pattern is unvarying and ultimately irritating and the absence of romantic development is paralleled by choreography that, lacking a feeling for pace, proceeds in a series of false climaxes. The company dance their hearts out nevertheless, with Ryoichi Hirano's glittery-eyed, pencil-moustached Espada a notable highlight.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419098852'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2013/10/4/1380902231635/dance-extra-001.jpg' alt='dance-extra' width='220' height='350' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Marianela Nunez (Kitri) and Carlos Acosta (Basilio) in Don Quixote by the Royal Ballet. Photograph:  Tristram Kenton</figcaption></figure><p>Act 2 works better. The set remains intrusive (self-propelled windmills, no less), but Acosta has enlivened the brigand's encampment with a flamenco scene and there's a fine gypsy dance by <a href=\"http://www.itziarmendizabal.com/\" title=\"\">Itziar Mendizabal </a>and Thomas Whitehead. With her fierce gaze, proud bearing and serpentine arms, Mendizabal is every inch the wild <em>gitana</em>. Whitehead does his level best to look villainous, but a blokeish decency shines through and, in general, these brigands are a cheerily unthreatening bunch.</p><p>In the vision scene, bizarrely set against a backdrop of giant mauve chrysanthemums, Melissa Hamilton is uncharacteristically muted as the Queen of the Dryads and Elizabeth Harrod is a pretty, petite Amour. The ensemble, led by Yuhui Choe and Beatriz Stix-Brunell, dance with porcelain charm and look lovely in Hatley's sugary pastel tutus.</p><p>Act 3 is one of those tavern scenes where everyone throws empty tankards over their shoulders and no one pays for their drinks. Happily, Mendizabal is in evidence again, smouldering away, Hirano's Espada makes another furiously dramatic appearance, and there's a fabulously camp turn from Kristen McNally as the tavern girl. The final pas de deux provides its usual reliable thrills. Nuñez delivers a glittering cascade of leaps and turns, coolly surviving a minor hairdressing crisis, and Acosta shows us that he can still summon the old skills and the old insouciant style.</p><p>Clearly this production needs a lot of work, particularly the structure and choreography of Act 1. But its heart's in the right place, its faults are more or less fixable, and with a fair wind it could even find a lasting place in the repertoire. It would certainly look good alongside a new <em>Swan Lake</em>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418853829|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|cda51e14529d475f1bc45b7878bef91f8e5d6b6f -->",

        "body":"<h2>Wayne McGregor: Atomos, London</h2><p>Wayne McGregor may be one of the hottest choreographers in the world of contemporary ballet, but it's via his own company Random Dance that he presents his most exploratory work. His latest, Atomos, is driven by his continuing fascination with the world of science and takes the physical structure of the atom as its visual and conceptual starting point. It may be cerebral but as always the stage is a richly sensual theatrescape, with lighting design by Lucy Carter, film projections by Ravie Deprees, music by \"indie classical\" stars A Winged Victory For The Sullen, and costumes that exist at the cutting edge between fabric and digital technology.</p><p><em>Sadler's Wells, EC1, Wed to 12 Oct; then touring to 1 Apr</em></p><h2>Dance Umbrella, London</h2><p>Dance Umbrella is celebrating its 35th year, and is still as hard to pin down as ever. This season it is combining a range of outdoor events and theatre performances, with highlights including a short season from the Trisha Brown Dance Company. The group revives the classic Astral Convertible, as well the final work Brown has created for her dancers. There's a UK premiere for the much acclaimed Lili Handel, in which performer Ivo Dimchev explores the mind and body of a failed diva, plus a welcome return for the gorgeously provocative Robin Orlin whose latest work 'Beauty Remained For Just A Minute Then Returned Gently To Her Starting Position…' is a celebration of the raucous, inventive beauty in African culture.</p><p><em>Various venues, to 20 Oct</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419048273|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|4745c407b78c0aed268c14ea378b95fa3889dcd8 -->",

        "body":"<h2>The Winter's Tale, Sheffield</h2><p>Shakespeare's heart-breaking late-period romance gets an outing at the on-form Crucible. Associate director Paul Miller helms a cast which includes Daniel Lapaine as the hot-headed Leontes who erroneously believes that his wife, Hermione, has been unfaithful to him with his old friend, Polixenes. The plotting may be fantastical but the emotions are always recognisably human and true as Leontes destroys his own happiness and everyone he loves. This is one of the great plays about the possibilities of redemption and the terrible pain of loss when what you have done cannot be reversed. It's not the easiest play to pull off, but when it succeeds it is as satisfying and moving as any of the great tragedies.</p><p><strong><em>The Crucible, to 2 Nov</em></strong></p><p><em>LG</em></p><h2> The Noise, Newcastle upon Tyne</h2><p>On a remote island near Antarctica, there's a constant noise. Nobody knows where it comes from or why it started, and shortly after it starts a massive iceberg drifts into the harbour and then a body is washed up. Is there a connection between these two events and the noise? This is the question posed by the latest play from Unlimited Theatre, a company which has often combined theatre and science in interesting ways, and has billed The Noise as \"a sci-thriller\" which should appeal to fans of HBO dramas. The show uses audio and visuals to explore the connections between sound and memory, and what noise does to our brains.</p><p><strong><em>Northern Stage, Sat to 12 Oct</em></strong></p><p><em>LG</em></p><h2>Tonypandemonium, Treorchy</h2><p>A dysfunctional mother and daughter are the focus of this debut play by the talented Rhondda-born writer Rachel Trezise. She has already notched up success and awards as a novelist, with her first short fiction collection – Fresh Apples – winning the Dylan Thomas Prize. Strongly autobiographical, Tonypandemonium charts a decade in the lives of a family and is described as raunchy, hilarious and heart-breaking. That's quite a lot to live up to, but Trezise can deliver.</p><p><strong><em>Park And Dare Theatre, Thu to 19 Oct</em></strong></p><p><em>LG</em></p><h2>The Love Girl &amp; The Innocent, London</h2><p>Nobel prize winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is best known for his epic novel The Gulag Archipelago. It is an excoriating indictment of the Soviet Union's penal system during Joseph Stalin's tenure (in which Solzhenitsyn was imprisoned). But that work was pre-empted by his 1969 play which had similar themes. The Love Girl &amp; The Innocent, which is receiving its first London production in more than 30 years, is set in 1945 and focuses on one prisoner, Nemov – the \"innocent\" of the title. He is sentenced to 10 years for 'counter-revolutionary activities' and finds his honesty tested by the corrupt prison system, particularly when he meets the \"love girl\" Lyuba (played by Kathryn Prescott, pictured). The piece is directed by the ever-busy Matthew Dunster.</p><p><strong><em>Southwark Playhouse, SE1, Wed to 2 Nov</em></strong></p><p><em>MC</em></p><h2>Perfect Nonsense, London</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419046529'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380880485503/perfect-008.jpg' alt='perfect' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Perfect Nonesense.</figcaption></figure><p>The much-loved characters of Jeeves and Wooster are familiar from the PG Wodehouse books, TV adaptations (the panned Blandings being the most recent), and were seen onstage in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn's 1975 musical By Jeeves. But strangely they have never featured in a play. Now there's Jeeves &amp; Wooster In Perfect Nonsense, starring Matthew Macfadyen as the stoic but resourceful manservant and Stephen Mangan as his dim-witted boss. Based on the 1938 book The Code Of The Woosters, it's been put together by the Goodale brothers, Robert an actor and David a documentary-maker, who got approval from the protective Wodehouse estate. Sean Foley, who is to tackle the X Factor musical I Can't Sing! next year, directs.</p><p><strong><em>Richmond Theatre, Thu to 19 Oct; touring to 26 Oct</em></strong></p><p><em>MC</em></p><h2>Long Day's Journey Into Night, Bolton</h2><p>Four of the actors from the cast that recently brought An Inspector Calls – JB Priestley's tale of middle-class guilt – to Bolton reappear here as the Tyrone clan, in one of modern drama's most compelling portraits of an unhappy family. Inspired by Eugene O'Neill's own dysfunctional family and described by him as \"old sorrow written in blood and tears\", the play tells the story during 24 hours. Over that short period the family is pulled apart by the bullying patriarch James Tyrone, and the various addictions of the family members. It's not exactly a cheery number, but the roles are as meaty and challenging as they come, and when the performances are spot-on this lacerating drama is compulsive viewing.</p><p><strong><em>Octagon Theatre, Thu to 2 Nov</em></strong></p><p><em>LG</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419045146|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|ceb8becbadb54117222840d8ec6a63406685dc3a -->",

        "body":"<h2>Susie Essman, London</h2><p>Larry David's fantastic Curb Your Enthusiasm has become a mainstay of US TV comedy because of its well crafted formula. One of the comedy cogs in Curb's world is Susie Essman and her extraordinary performances as the wife of Larry's manager, Jeff. Hugely prickly and given to venomous, foul-mouthed onslaughts at the slightest provocation (frequently calling Larry a \"four-eyed fuck\"), Essman's a delight whenever she appears. Given that the future of the show is uncertain, it's a treat to see her in person for a short run. Live, she doesn't have quite the powder-keg intensity of her TV alter ego – she's unlikely to lose it with the audience the way Susie does with David – but she certainly has the same take-no-prisoners demeanour. You can tell that Essman cut her teeth on the savage New York comedy circuit, and she keeps the crowd entertained with her amusingly hostile attitude as well as some ballsy gags.</p><p><em>Soho Downstairs, W1, Wed to 13 Oct</em></p><h2><a href=\"http://brightoncomedyfestival.com\" title=\"\">Brighton Comedy Festival</a></h2><p>If you're not a regular Edinburgh fringe-goer, then all the accounts of supposedly spellbinding comedy that fill the arts pages every August must leave you feeling a bit left out. But southerners have a chance to sample the best of 2013's fringe courtesy of the Brighton comedy festival, which has picked up nearly all the most talked-about shows from this summer. You can see Edinburgh comedy award winner Bridget Christie (Dome, Sun), whose deftly gag-studded polemic features flashes of genuine rage and some fantastically funny takedowns of contemporary sexism. Look out too for great shows from James Acaster (Komedia, 17 Oct), Seann Walsh (Old Market,  18-19 Oct), and Tasmania-born Hannah Gadsby (Komedia, Sun &amp; Thu), who provides a painfully honest and consistently hilarious account of her serial humiliations and gradual attempts to grow up.</p><p><em>Various venues</em></p><h2>John Lloyd: Liff Of Qi, London</h2><p>Whatever bits of classic British comedy you love, it's more than likely that John Lloyd had a hand in them. He invented Radio 4's The News Quiz, shepherded Blackadder to the screen, and played a role in the genesis of The Hitchhikers' Guide To The Galaxy and Spitting Image. Most recently, he's been behind BBC2's QI, reflecting his own curiosity about science, religion the odd phenomena that make up our world. Liff Of QI is a kind of live autobiography – and while Lloyd's track record means that it's a must for comedy fans eager to hear funny anecdotes, it's also packed with quirky facts about existence that reflect Lloyd's magpie-like mind. He'll also be reading definitions from The Meaning Of Liff, the comic masterpiece he created alongside Douglas Adams, where place names are used  to describe things for which there are no existing words.</p><p><em>Bloomsbury Theatre, WC1, Sat</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418985907|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|4f3e2eae04e36babb280d4550874243e08309dfd -->",

        "body":"<p>Over the past 35 years, <a href=\"http://www.danceumbrella.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dance Umbrella</a> has been an invaluable platform for young talent, hosting the early works of <a href=\"http://markmorrisdancegroup.org/the_company/about_mark_morris\" title=\"\">Mark Morris</a>, <a href=\"http://www.michaelclarkcompany.com/people_michael.php\" title=\"\">Michael Clark</a> and many more. This year, however, the festival opens with a pair of veteran artists – 65-year-old dancer-choreographer <a href=\"http://www.fortier-danse.com/FDC/ang/paf_choregraphe.php\" title=\"\">Paul-André Fortier</a> and 76-year-old violinist <a href=\"http://www.philmultic.com/artists/goldstein/\" title=\"\">Malcolm Goldstein</a>.</p><p>Both are performers with an immense accumulation of knowledge and craft, and when they first appear on stage – two lean, balding men illuminated by dimly glowing lightbulbs – we can't but be intrigued by the stories they have to tell.</p><p>Disappointingly, however, this duet provides only oblique revelations. Vertiges is essentially a dialogue between movement and sound. Goldstein opens in exploratory, tactile mode, his bow scraping, caressing and bouncing over the strings of his violin. In response, Fortier pats down the surfaces of his body, fingers the air, touches his hands softly against the wooden partition that forms the back wall of the stage.</p><p>As Goldstein coaxes longer notes from his instrument, Fortier's gestures also become more lyrically sustained, to the point where we can almost see the men's shared concentration resonating in space. The challenge they then set themselves is to sustain that connection even as the pace accelerates, and Goldstein's wild gypsyish improvisations push Fortier to more antic, scrabbling dance.</p><p>It's as if the two men are walking the tightrope of their own semi-improvised dialogue. But while that's a fascinating premise, it remains too forbiddingly abstract to sustain an hour-long performance. So many issues of trust, challenge and communication are raised in Vertiges, yet they rarely take on the warmth of a human dynamic. If these two men are going on a journey together, it remains a very private one.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>The most radical feature of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/20/richard-eyre-spirit-ibsen-ghosts\" title=\"\">Richard Eyre's first-rate revival of Ghosts</a> is its speed. Shorn of intervals, Ibsen's 1881 play races along and is over in 90 minutes. The effect is to remind us how much <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Henrik_Ibsen.aspx\" title=\"\">Ibsen</a>, the pioneer of naturalism, owed to Greek tragedy: he shows us the present consequences of past actions in a sustained arc of suffering.</p><p>Ibsen may be indebted to the Greeks, but here he also feels one of us: in showing Oswald's return from Paris to the stifling Alving family home, Ibsen confronts us with such themes as inherited disease, sibling incest and assisted death. At points I feel Eyre's new version is, verbally and visually, over-emphatic. Oswald here attacks those who question the freedom of the artistic life as \"moralising cretins\", and the terrifying moment when Oswald repeats the patterns of the past by seductively flirting with the maid is surely more effective when overheard rather than seen, as it is with the aid of Tim Hatley's transparent-walled set.</p><p>But otherwise Eyre's production grabs you by the throat and never releases its grip. Lesley Manville's Helene Alving starts as a buoyant, liberated woman determined to free herself from \"dead ideas, dead customs, dead morals\". The turning point (<a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/people/hartleyg/ref/aristotletragedy.html\" title=\"\">what Aristotle called \"peripeteia\"</a>) in her magnificent performance comes when, with half-closed bedroom eyes, she seeks to renew her old amorous attachment to Pastor Manders: coldly spurned, Manville becomes the image of desolation. Her climactic scene with Oswald, whose gradual degeneration is precisely charted by Jack Lowden, is also as powerful as I have seen in years, since mother and son engage in physical as well as moral combat.</p><p>Will Keen persuasively makes Pastor Manders a figure of evangelical fire, placing a protective hand on a model of the new Alving orphanage as if giving it divine blessing, who suddenly finds his certainties crumbling into dust. But the whole point of this extraordinary production is to show, as in <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3407200125.html\" title=\"\">Sophoclean tragedy</a>, a world that seems fixed, stable and coherent blown apart by the irredeemable past.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>The National Theatre (NT) has announced that it generated more than £87m last year, a record figure that means the organisation has almost doubled its annual turnover in the last six years.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://d1wf8hd6ovssje.cloudfront.net/documents/Annual_Report_2012-2013.pdf\" title=\"\">NT's annual report</a> indicates that overall takings rose by £7m, in 2012-13, roughly the same as it has done every year since 2008, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/war-horse\" title=\"\">War Horse transferred to the West End</a>. That production was the first commercial transfer the National produced itself, a tactic that has helped the theatre increase turnover by £40m a year. War Horse took £15.1m in the West End alone last year, with a further 1.4 million people watching a performance overseas.</p><p>Those seeking a reason for the venue's success need only look at the number of people coming through the doors. 1.48 million people attended a National Theatre production in London, while the organisation's total reach hit 3.6 million – up from 2.3 million – thanks to national tours, international productions and NT Live broadcasts. The South Bank venue played to 90% capacity.</p><p>Fifty-five percent of the National Theatre's income is now drawn from its UK box office, with commercial transfers accounting for £25.1 million and productions at South Bank, £22.5m. A further £3.8m (4%) is generated by productions overseas. Its £17.5m grant from Arts Council England represents only 20%.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/nicholashytner\" title=\"\">artistic director Nicholas Hytner</a>, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2013/oct/02/national-theatre-hytner-successor-changes\" title=\"\">leaves his position in 2015</a>, said that the theatre \"must now become ever more dependent on the generosity of its supporters\". The theatre generated £6.3m from fundraising activities last year, down from £6.6m. <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/10-2013/nicholas-hytner-national-theatre-is-ever-more-depe_32142.html\" title=\"\">Hytner claimed that without such donations</a> \"our repertoire would have shrunk, our outreach would be a fraction of what it is and the work we do outside of our three theatres – through our learning department and at our studio – would be under severe threat\".</p><p>Hytner also added that theatre more generally was entering \"very perilous times, particularly outside London where individual and corporate giving has yet to make anything like the kind of impact that it has in the capital\".</p><p>Profits for the financial year were down to £2.9m – the lowest since 2007-08 – but that drop was partly down to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/13/curious-incident-dog-night-time-review\" title=\"\">West End transfer of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</a>, which had just opened by April. The NT will recoup its costs this year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419074402|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|49e391c5d80a22b5e1ddf1b63ba9171bd7cbf649 -->",

        "body":"<p>Richard Eyre's <a href=\"http://www.almeida.co.uk/event/ghosts\" title=\"\"><strong>Ghosts</strong> </a>hammers at the heart. Shouldn't that, you cry, be Henrik Ibsen's <em>Ghosts</em>? Well, no. I have more often been disturbed and impressed by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSb3IFpwLvs\" title=\"\"><em>Ghosts</em></a> than truly moved.</p><p>The reach of this 1881 play is extraordinary: inheritance, venereal disease, euthanasia, conflagration, snobbery, feminism. The ferocity with which it attacks not only turpitude but misplaced ideals about marriage and loyalty is tremendous. Bernard Shaw put his finger on it when he said that <em>Ghosts</em> showed the 19th century loathing itself. In a mighty couple of hours, Ibsen once again gave drama a shove into the next century and beyond.</p><p>Yet Eyre's production is above all profoundly intimate, proving with intensity the stranglehold the past can exert. It is immediately evident that this will be a staging of great suggestiveness as well as resonance. Tim Hatley's design and Peter Mumford's lighting create a solidly realistic drawing&nbsp;room set against a fluid, glimmering, constantly changing background. Shadows and faint figures are glimpsed through transparent screens; a portrait, presumably of the patriarchal ogre, floats like a fly in amber. Ghosts are there from the beginning. The walls flush with fire and close in darkly on the characters.</p><p>The action moves at a 21st-century lick. Events arrive with the shock of a thriller. \"Oh no,\" cried out a young American teacher, new to the play and riven by one terrible irony. Yet there is also stillness and patience – not least in the central performance of Lesley Manville. She holds herself as if she were made of porcelain, barely gesturing, until she finally fractures and shatters. Will Keen, at his best when least emphatic as the love-quenching pastor, does wonderful work with his terrible zealot eyes. It's not only that he transfixes with his mad gaze. He cleverly does the opposite, dropping his stare when most drawn to someone. As the stricken son, Oswald, who brings back to the house awful suggestions of his father, Jack Lowden transmits a powerfully physical sense of his condition, moving from a dreadful torpor to an anguished writhing.</p><p>Eyre has written his own new version of the play, based on a literal translation by Charlotte Barslund. Its clarity and forcefulness are central to the evening's success. It is never over-idiomatic or straining, yet it contains not one stale phrase. Oswald's terror of the future is finely captured in his lament that he is about to turn into \"a grey-haired infant\". A shrewd attention to the speeches of the \"illegitimate\" daughter who is brought up as a maid in her father's house illuminates the horror of her history and makes a tragic heroine of what might be thought a minor part. Well supported by Brian McCardle as her father, Charlene McKenna brings to the part a delicate lack of sentimentality.</p><p>We are living in a period of marvellous productions of Ibsen: one of the highlights of last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/21/carrie-cracknell-dolls-house-interview\" title=\"\">Carrie Cracknell's</a> production of <em>The Doll's House</em>, is about to go to New York. How things have changed since the premiere of <em>Ghosts</em>, when an orgy of critical denunciation proclaimed it as \"garbage and offal\", \"loathsome and fetid\" and the \"maunderings of [useful vocab] nook-shotten Norwegians\".</p><p>It's 16 years since the digital world burst on to the stage in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4puFhktZZzY\" title=\"\"><em>Closer</em></a>. No one who saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/marber\" title=\"\">Patrick Marber</a>'s play will forget the moment when, with the stage dominated by giant computer screens, two characters began to tap out messages to each other. And started&nbsp;to lie about themselves. Their typed-out fibs hung above them like damning headlines.</p><p>The stage is the ideal place to show the gap between what we tweet and mail and who we are. It's sharp of Brigid Larmour, artistic director of Watford Palace, to commission three plays on the subject.</p><p>There is nothing as seismic as that <em>Closer</em> moment in the two opening plays. Not simply because familiarity has taken the edge off surprise, but because in neither play is the staging as well as the subject matter seized by digitisation. Neither contains an episode in which the new technology is seen as well as cited.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419109569'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380818301916/Simon-Darwen-and-Laura-El-010.jpg' alt='Simon Darwen and Laura Elphinstone in Virgin at Watford Palace theatre.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Simon Darwen and Laura Elphinstone in Virgin at Watford Palace theatre. Photograph: Robert Day</figcaption></figure><p>Still, the diversity of the playwrights' approaches makes the case for this mini-season, which is completed by Stacey Gregg's <em>Override</em>. Gary Owen's <a href=\"http://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/page/perfect-match\" title=\"\"><strong>Perfect Match</strong></a> is an accomplished comedy which takes off from technological possibilities (a dating site) rather than exploring them. It's a frothily neat meshing of new subject matter and old format. EV Crowe's <a href=\"http://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/page/virgin\" title=\"\"><strong>Virgin</strong></a> (the hymen is digital) meanders in the middle but looks at the question of what the internet has done for women (often shafting them) with the perspicacity you would expect from this astute young playwright.</p><p>I liked the opening shot (bloke with a book, woman with a laptop). I admired the nimble attacks and the description of the househusband who would not call himself a feminist but looks a bit like one since he \"doesn't know how to be unfair\". I loved watching Laura Elphinstone as a gauche, febrile woman burning herself up with anxiety.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419109570'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380818441303/Nicholas-Day-and-Charlott-010.jpg' alt='Nicholas Day and Charlotte Randle in The Lyons by Nicky Silver at the Menier.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Nicholas Day and Charlotte Randle in The Lyons by Nicky Silver at the Menier. Photograph:  Tristram Kenton</figcaption></figure><p>Nicky Silver's <a href=\"https://www.menierchocolatefactory.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=6CE4A8B0-1A2C-4151-8428-E0F0049D9EF1&amp;sessionlanguage=\" title=\"\"><strong>The Lyons</strong></a> was a<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnaGyX7G8eA\" title=\"\"> New York hit</a> in 2011. It comes here with the same director, Mark Brokaw, and a British cast doing sterling, or dollar, accent woik, but it looks peaky. Silver has picked and mixed familiar plot ingredients. A family gathers around the deathbed patriarch: cue strife and secrets. One character has a romantic escape. Another is driven to invent a romantic life. The extent of the vitriol is the main surprise, with its nicely turned causticness: \"This cancer is making you very bad-tempered.\"</p><p>The most original scene is a diversion from the play's main family-exploding business. An estate agent shows a young man around a New York apartment. The long skinny stage suddenly seems appropriate, made for people to coil and spring at each other. The duplicity and delusion are lively. Weirdly, it made me wish there were more plays about estate agents.</p><p><em>Star ratings (out of 5):</em><br /><em>Ghosts</em> ★★★★★<br /><em>Perfect Match</em> ★★★<br /><em>Virgin</em> ★★★<br /><em>The Lyons</em> ★★<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418991266|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|ca39913776b4cd2dbc1c3d9a8ef407df55abefd7 -->",

        "headline":"Doubling the fun? When actors do two for the price of one",
        "body":"<p>Although the main business of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/oct/02/handbagged-review-queen-margaret-thatcher\" title=\"\">Handbagged, Moira Buffini's rightly acclaimed new play</a>, is the meetings between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, the evening is equally acute and amusing about various theatrical conventions – in particular, the practice of doubling, in which one performer plays several parts.</p><p>During the two hours of Indhu Rubasingham's production, the two male cast members, Neet Mohan and Jeff Rawle, regularly appear or reappear as different characters. While, in most such cases, performers and audiences are expected to collude in pretending this isn't happening, here it becomes an exuberantly acknowledged part of the proceedings.</p><p>After four scenes in which Mohan has played a palace footman in the background, HM and her PM discuss their impending joint attendance at a Commonwealth heads of government conference in Zambia. The Buck House lackey suddenly asks the monarch: \"Would it be useful if I changed parts now, ma'am? I could stop playing palace footman and play Kenneth Kaunda, president of Zambia.\" Simultaneously, Rawle, who has been playing Denis Thatcher, swaps one pair of spectacles for another, poshs up his voice, and announces: \"I'm Peter Carrington, foreign secretary.\"</p><p>Buffini and Rubasingham have tremendous fun with this forced multiplicity. Thatcher, who was notoriously humourless and suspicious of the indulgences of art, becomes indignant at the trick: \"How can you be Peter Carrington when you're Denis?\" Subsequently, both suffer the existential nightmare of the doubling actor: of being in one character and realising that the next person to speak is someone else you are also playing.  In another scene, the two actors, who eventually share 17 characters between them, bicker over who is doing Neil Kinnock and then have an oratorical face-off to settle it.</p><p>These moments nicely combine theatrical practicality – making a virtue of the circumstance that a theatre such as the Kilburn Tricycle cannot afford large casts – with dramatic invention: a version of Bertolt Brecht's anti-realistic devices, but played for laughs rather than demonstration of theory.</p><p>There is an additional frisson because the play also contains the opposite effect: one character played by more than one actor. Marion Bailey and Claire Holman take the elder and younger selves of Elizabeth II, while Stella Gonet and Fenella Woolgar divide the senior and junior Thatcher. This means that, as in Peter Nichols' Passion Play and Alan Bennett's A Question of Attribution, we have the unusual situation in which the main characters can argue with themselves.</p><p>Although less central to the concept than in Handbagged, actors on double time are a common feature of theatre. Bigger Shakespeare plays are rarely economic to cast entirely one-to-one – although, in these cases, there is the historical justification that Shakespeare, a practical man of theatre who worked in a commercial culture, would have been familiar with doubling and the plays are frequently structured to make this easy.</p><p>Michael Grandage, in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/17/midsummer-nights-dream-review-walliams-smith\" title=\"\">highly entertaining West End production of A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>, revives a frequently used device, which turns the financial advantage of part sharing to artistic gain as well. Padraic Delaney and Sheridan Smith appear as Thesus and Hippolyta in the Athenian court scenes, but then become Oberon and Titania in the fantastical forest sequences, with the clear and satisfying implication – in a production concept that evokes the 1960s – that the fairy personae are the drug or dream selves of the dull aristocrats.</p><p>But role sharing puts heavy pressure on performers to differentiate. In the otherwise disastrous Old Vic production of Much Ado About Nothing, the calamitous miscasting of the veterans James Earl Jones and Vanessa Redgrave as  Benedick and Beatrice is offset by a masterclass in doubling from <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9913493/Peter-Wight-My-heroes-and-heroines.html\" title=\"\">Peter Wight, long established as our most reliable stage character actor</a>, who alternates a comic Dogberry with a haunted Friar Francis. While the burly Wight is immediately recognisable in both roles, he effectively employs very different areas of his vocal spectrum and contrasting body language to make the convention work.</p><p>Such ingenuity is mainly required in classic revivals. Since the last-but-one theatrical funding crunch in the 1980s, new writers have usually understood that, unless they are under commission from the National Theatre or the RSC, it is sensible to write plays with between three and five characters. This is the most that the wage structure of the smaller subsidised and almost all non-subsidised theatres can take, but has the obvious drawback that it threatened to make the chamber play the default format for new authors.</p><p>Two younger dramatists, though, have recently accommodated doubling to make their scripts go further. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/13/review-the-pride\" title=\"\">Alexi Kaye Campbell's The Pride employs the device thematically</a>, with the same actors playing comparable or contrasting figures in gay culture in the 1950s and today. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/07/same-deep-water-as-me-review\" title=\"\">Nick Payne's The Same Deep Water as Me</a> dared to feature 11 speaking roles that, in John Crowley's production, asked three actors each to play two roles, with Peter Forbes impressively alternating a London chancer with a dry Scottish judge.</p><p>As British theatre is unlikely to become flush with money in the foreseeable future, writers and directors are going to have to become ever more adept at such tricks. And, as the Queen is reputed to go around Buckingham Palace turning out lights and Margaret Thatcher often complained about the waste of public money, the central figures in Handbagged would surely approve of being part of such canny recycling.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419078946|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|e510777bb5296f39c0cfde1700411a01dd799033 -->",

        "body":"<p>All the world's a madhouse in James Brining's revival of Sondheim's greatest musical, inspired by his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/may/26/sweeney-todd-review\" title=\"\">2010 production at Dundee Rep</a>. The Victorian corsets were loosened in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/07/sweeney-todd-review\" title=\"\">Jonathan Kent's Chichester/West End production</a>  which relocated the story to a depression-hit 1930s, but Brining rips the stays away entirely. This staging is sunk in the dead-fly gloom of the 1970s and played out on a cavernous stage peopled by the shuffling inmates of Mr Fogg's Private Asylum for the Mentally Deranged. The suggestion is that there is something completely insane about a society where the gap between rich and poor is so great. Not least because it spawns monsters of many kinds.</p><p>Strip away the Victorian gothic and the show is suddenly less lurid but all the more terrifying. In David Birrell's compulsively watchable performance, Sweeney is a dark-suited avenging angel turned serial killer. He is made, not born, both piteous and pitiless. Bring him together with the cheerfully amoral Mrs Lovett, owner of a fly-infested café, and you have a recipe for disaster – and, of course, unspeakable meat pies. Gillian Bevan's peroxide, emotionally needy Lovett is an unhygienic pleasure, less comic than many but all the more real because of it.</p><p>This is a fascinating, febrile evening, but not one for those who like their musical theatre succulent and untroubling. It spares the audience nothing, and like one of Mrs Lovett's meat pies it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. Even the way it looks – in Colin Richmond's design – suggests a city of empty containers, boarded-up buildings and corrugated iron, as ugly as Judge Turpin's soul. It's a brave first production for the West Yorkshire Playhouse's new artistic director to deliver, and a very tasty statement of intent.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>A revival of Arnold Wesker's 1959 play, <a href=\"http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/whats-on/donmar-warehouse/2013/roots\">Roots</a>, opens at the Donmar Warehouse next week. It stars <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jan/04/hotlist-actor-theatre-jessica-raine\">Jessica Raine</a> as the young Beatie Bryant, who has left her Norfolk farm-labouring family for the bright lights of London and fallen under the spell of an intellectual, Ronnie. I like the play very much, but I absolutely love Beatie's miraculous speech near the end, when she suddenly discovers her own voice. When this play is done well, it can one of the most joyous and electrifying moments in theatre.</p><p>There are lots of speeches I love in Chekhov, but <a href=\"http://www.monologuearchive.com/c/chekhov_010.html\">Sonya's final speech</a> to Uncle Vanya – both disappointed in love, both needing the strength to go on – never fails to move me. In fact, if I had to choose a single favourite speech, it would probably be that one. </p><p>But although the big set-piece speech is perhaps less common than it used to be, sometimes the smaller, understated passage can be just as enticing. I loved the way Complicite put John Berger's words into the mouth of Ruth and Al in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/sep/15/a-disappearing-number-review\">A Disappearing Number</a>. They are worth quoting:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What reconciles me to my own death more than anything else is the image of a place: a place where your bones and mine are buried, thrown, uncovered, together. They are strewn there pell-mell. One of your ribs leans against my skull. A metacarpal of my left hand lies inside your pelvis. (Against my broken ribs your breast like a flower.) The hundred bones of our feet are scattered like gravel. It is strange that this image of our proximity, concerning as it does mere phosphate of calcium, should bestow a sense of peace. Yet it does. With you I can imagine a place where to be phosphate of calcium is enough.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe I like it so much because it's comforting. I feel the same about Septimus's speech in Tom Stoppard's mighty <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2009/jun/03/tom-stoppard-arcadia \">Arcadia</a>, when, in response to Thomasina's despair at the burning of the library at Alexandria, he says:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We shed as we pick up, like travellers who must carry everything in their arms, and what we let fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is very long and life is very short. We die on the march. But there is nothing outside the march so nothing can be lost to it. The missing plays of Sophocles will turn up piece by piece, or be written again in another language. Ancient cures for diseases will reveal themselves once more. Mathematical discoveries glimpsed and lost to view will have their time again. You do not suppose, my lady, that if all of Archimedes had been hiding in the great library of Alexandria, we would be at a loss for a corkscrew?</p></blockquote><p>And, of course, there is Shakespeare. Which speeches do you really love? Is it the rousing St Crispin's Eve speech in Henry V or Jaques's \"all the world's a stage\" from As You Like It? Is it Portia's famous \"<a href=\"http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/merchant_4_1.html\">the quality of mercy is not strained</a>\" from The Merchant of Venice or the \"<a href=\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/richardii/richardii.3.2.html\">sad stories of the death of kings</a>\" in Richard II? </p><p>Share your favourite speeches, from plays old and new. What are they to be (or not to be)?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418724103|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|249ede08a2935d93718ef5063fc37b2dbd324ae1 -->",
