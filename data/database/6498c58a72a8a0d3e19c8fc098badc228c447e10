        "headline":"Adelaide United: 10 years on",
        "body":"<p>Rebirth has become a familiar theme for football fans in Australia. The seemingly fatal plunge into crisis is invariably followed by a splendid renaissance. Football historian Ian Syson notes that the game has experienced several periods of boom and bust dating back to the 1880s. Journalists, fans and administrators have grappled with the \"sleeping giant\" complex for several decades. </p><p>Just last year, in April, the Western Sydney Wanderers were born after Clive Palmer's catastrophic Gold Coast United were stripped of their A-League license. Wellington Phoenix owe their moniker to their unlikely rise from the ashes of the New Zealand Knights, an Auckland based franchise that folded in 2007. </p><p>In 2003, football in Adelaide underwent its own revolution in the final season of the National Soccer League (NSL). After Adelaide City (nee Juventus) collapsed just weeks before the start of the season, a new entity, Adelaide United, was hastily thrown together. The club-on-the-run was granted six weeks to prepare, entering the competition in round five, with the earlier fixtures played as midweek catch-up games later in the season.</p><p>The transition from 'City' to 'United' might have seemed minor to outsiders, but the reformation in Adelaide was a microcosm of a larger debate happening in the football community. In April 2003, the Howard Government commissioned the Crawford Report, before Frank Lowy appointed his NSL Task Force in October. </p><p>While the Crawford Report focused primarily on reforming the game's administration, the NSL Task Force – which was headed by several businessmen and former Socceroos Johnny Warren, Charlie Yankos and Jack Reilly – recommended \"the current NSL must cease operations, with a new national competition established in its place.\" </p><p>With the seeds planted for the birth of a new competition, Adelaide United were the youngest of four premature children in the A-League litter. The eldest was Perth Glory, which entered the NSL in 1996 to enormous fanfare, while the middle, more troublesome children were the New Zealand Knights, who entered the NSL in 1999, and Newcastle United Jets, who replaced the Newcastle Breakers in 2000. </p><p>While Newcastle had fielded a single team throughout most of the 28 seasons of the NSL, the New Zealand Knights and Perth Glory were brand new franchises, representing the first club in their respective areas to participate in a national football competition. </p><p>Adelaide United, however, would achieve something quite different. In a recent article for the FFA, <a href=\"http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/kosmina-opinion-display/adelaide--still-united-ten-years-on/76025\">inaugural coach John Kosmina commented</a>, \"the arrival of Adelaide United changed everything. It was a virtual ménage au trois between the South Australian Soccer Federation, the fans, and the local state league clubs. Everyone felt a sense of ownership. Everyone got a piece of the action.\"</p><p>The city of churches had been home to two sides during the NSL. The Italian-backed Adelaide City and the Greek-backed West Adelaide formed a fierce rivalry which had as much to do with ethnicity as it had geography. </p><p>In this context, 'United' was a reference to a coming together of the tribes, and the club strategically chose to wear the red, blue and gold of South Australia. Past greats of football in Adelaide were welcomed into the fold, as well as South Australian sporting luminaries Lleyton Hewitt, Gavin Wanganeen and women's basketball star Rachel Sporn, who all attended the first match. Premier Mike Rann was the club's No1 ticket-holder. </p><p>Community radio stations were warned they had to broadcast in English, before the rights were sold exclusively to Radio 5DN, giving the club a mainstream commercial partner. </p><p>To the Adelaide Advertiser football writer Meno Toutsidis, the public yearned for a team \"as identifiably South Australian as the Adelaide Crows, Port Adelaide, the 36ers, the Redbacks, Thunderbirds and Lightning.\"</p><p>On local businessman Gordon Pickard's dollar, Adelaide were determined to represent the whole of South Australia. The board had a distinct South Australian flavour. Their first coach, Kosmina, came from a strong local football family, while captain Aurelio Vidmar was born and bred in Adelaide. And while most of the squad was inherited from Adelaide City, the decision was made to select new players from the local state competition to provide a bridge for South Australian talent to perform on a national stage. </p><p>Having spent two seasons with Brisbane Strikers, in 2003 Richie Alagich took a job with the South Australian State Federation as a development officer. \"My wife was pregnant with our first child at the time, and I decided I couldn't wait around,\" Alagich told Guardian Australia. \"I thought, if I don't play again for the national league, no dramas. There's more important things.\" Despite this decision, the birth of Adelaide United gave Alagich another chance to play in the NSL. \"I was fortunate in that regard,\" says Alagich.</p><p>The club's first season would be a success, but the first match at Hindmarsh Stadium exactly 10 years ago today was where 'the People's Team' were truly forged. \"I still get goosebumps thinking about walking out that first time to that crowd\", remembers Alagich. \"The first 10 or 15 minutes you couldn't even hear each other on the pitch because of the noise and the excitement.\" </p><p>The official statistics say 15,568 fans squeezed into Hindmarsh Stadium that night, but as Andrew Howe, an United fan and now the resident statistician at the FFA, says, \"I remember one of the main head Adelaide United admin guys telling me how they probably had 2,000 more than official capacity, but they couldn't admit that because of legal implications.</p><p>\"Because I was trying to sell as many copies of my match day program that night, I can vouch for the mayhem at the turnstiles.\"</p><p>A bumper crowd, sparkling fireworks, pre-game entertainment and the weight of expectation all dovetailed to set the stage for their debut match against Brisbane Strikers, one of the competition's strongest sides. </p><p>\"It was a coming together of the entire football community\" remembers Adam Butler, a foundation member of Adelaide United. \"Carl Veart scored the winning goal and Richie Alagich set him up, they were two club legends. It was almost romantic.\" </p><p>For Alagich, that night in front of a full Hindmarsh Stadium has become a memorable moment in his career. \"I get the feeling there was a lot of other players that think that as well. It's not something we thought we'd see in our playing days.\"</p><p>In his match report, Howe suggested, \"that a new team can generate such popularity will instil confidence in the sport's power-brokers and show potential investors that large-scale support for the domestic game does currently exist.\"</p><p>Howe's hypothesis proved correct. Remo Nogarotto, one of the members of the NSL Task Force and then chairman of the competition, was impressed with what he saw at Hindmarsh Stadium. </p><p>\"It was pretty clear that the game had finally 'arrived' as a mainstream sporting product, albeit without the traditional ethnic fan base that had sustained and nurtured the games development for over 50 years\" said Nogarotto in an interview with Guardian Australia. </p><p>\"As a businessman I found the former positively exciting. As a fan and historian of the game I found the latter very sad. It was as if decades of toil and financial sacrifice by the games pioneers had been ripped from the few football annals we had.\"</p><p>According to Adam Butler, \"Adelaide United tried to respect where the club came from and its roots. You can't deny or ignore the history of the game.\" As a former Adelaide City fan, Butler personified the transition from old to new. \"I loved Adelaide City games, and I thoroughly enjoyed the multicultural aspect of the club.\" </p><p>Still, sentimentality and business have never made for comfortable bedfellows, especially in football. Adelaide United were bold, they were exciting, and they scratched the football community right where they itched. </p><p>Ten years on, some of that community focus has waned. To Alagich, change occurred out of circumstance, not design. \"Once a week we'd go and train at a local club, at night because we were still part-time footballers. There was always 300 or 400 people at training, really engaging with the local clubs and the football community.\"</p><p>\"With the A-League we were full time players. As the times change we had to find new ways of engaging the people. We were now training during the day, so if we were to go and do a session at the club, no-one would be there because everybody was working and the kids were at school. Those dynamics have to change.\"</p><p>As the A-League replaced the NSL, once again it was in with the new and out with the old. Many fans believe the FFA has taken some of the personality out of the club. There is no longer such an emphasis on local players, and 'the People's Team' motto has since slipped away. To the FFA, the 'new' clubs were considered the sexiest, in particular Sydney FC, Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory.</p><p>Tomorrow evening, <a href=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/p480x480/1374237_10153426792735019_1616793292_n.jpg\">Adelaide United will play in the original club strip</a>, which has been emblazoned with <a href=\"http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/adelaideunited/news-display/Ten-year-anniversary--commemorative-logo/66970\">a special commemorative logo</a> designed by the Adelaide United Historical Committee, of which Adam Butler is a member.</p><p>To Butler, Adelaide \"will always be the People's Team. They were born that way and it must remain that way.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420094016|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|33eec708a5ff82f69a14d21155e9b52ffb05d3eb -->",

        "body":"<p>John Aloisi's men stifled their Melbourne rivals in a battle of defence and attack. Aloisi admitted as much post-game, saying he was impressed by the tactical intricacies of the 0-0 match. Heart's defence was the most fascinating aspect of the derby and was in stark contrast to their approach in last year's round one meeting. </p><p>In that match, Heart adopted a \"full-court press\" in defence, testing Victory's ability to play through intense pressure in a new and unfamiliar system. On that occasion, Heart's defensive approach was incredibly successful, with Victory's insistence on playing out at every opportunity causing multiple dangerous turnovers, two of which lead to Heart goals. Heart never allowed their opponents to settle in possession and fully deserved their 2-1 derby win.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419968777'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381797242206/Melbourne-Hearts-defence-006.jpg' alt='Melbourne Heart's defence' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Heart’s defensive approach from the previous Round 1 derby, where a full court press was used. This approach often forced Victory to pass back to debutant goalkeeper Lawrence Thomas. Photograph: Graphic</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, Victory's ability to play through a high pressing opponent has improved out of sight, whereas Heart were unable to match their early performance, finishing ninth last season, 17 points and six places behind Melbourne Victory. </p><p>Victory's stark improvement meant a similar defensive approach this time around would have played into their hands, as their major attacking threat comes when they look to exploit space in behind their opponents. However, one thing they haven't quite mastered consistently is the ability to break down a team who limits such space. Heart's game plan instead centred around preventing Victory from getting in behind their defence. </p><p>\"We had a game plan and the boys did really well defensively; we didn't allow them get in behind us too many times,\" Aloisi said post-game.</p><p>The most logical way to prevent a team from getting in behind your defence is to sit back, and Melbourne Heart did just that – setting their defensive block up around half way. The fact that eight out of the top 10 passers in the match were Melbourne Victory players demonstrated Heart's willingness to concede possession. </p><p>Key to Victory's formation, where the central attackers drop into midfield to create space for the wide forwards to move into midfield to create space for the wide forwards to break into, is the off-the-ball movements of the 'false 9' or 'dual 10' players. But Heart devised a defensive plan which, like Perth's in the 2012-13 elimination final, prevented them from receiving possession in their preferred attacking positions. </p><p>New recruits Mitch Nichols and James Troisi dropped into midfield, positioning themselves either side of Heart's central midfield duo of Massimo Murdocca and Andrea Migliorini in an attempt to receive the ball in dangerous positions to pick out the runs of the converging wide duo of Connor Pain and Archie Thompson.</p><p>In order to nullify this, instead of defending in a straight line 4-4-2, Heart's wide midfielders, Mate Dugandzic and David Williams, positioned themselves in advance of their deeper central midfielders which prevented passes into the feet of Troisi and Nichols on either side of Murdocca and Migliorini. And whenever they were able to pick out Troisi and Nichols, Heart were quick to close the ball, breaking up play with tackles and, on occasions, fouls. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Williams (6/7), Murdocca (4/5), Migliorini (4/5) and Dugandzic (2/4) topped the tackle charts, as they harried the ball carrier in midfield.<br />This frustrated Victory, who were unable to get into an attacking rhythm. Despite seeing considerably more of the ball, Victory looked vulnerable on the counter attack and Heart created more goal scoring opportunities in the scoreless draw.</p><p>With this performance, Aloisi again proved that he has the tactical flexibility to frustrate their cross-city rivals. Heart's structure defensive approach and counter-attacking style was the most promising feature of the encounter, but Aloisi and Heart now have to prove they can play at a similar level for the remaining 26 rounds, something they failed to do last season.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419966934|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|9d438e4aa39358061fb1473075d818697c40c068 -->",

This has been a great start ... and we expect it to build from here.

        "headline":"A-League: what we learned this weekend",
        "body":"<h2>Newcastle need Heskey</h2><p>Let's be honest. The first A-League game to be screened on free-to-air television was a bit of a fizzer. Alessandro Del Piero scored one and set up another, but t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/11/sydney-fc-newcastle-jets-a-league-match-report\">he football from both sides was more drive-in than Hollywood blockbuster</a>. It was enjoyable enough, but mostly for the simple pleasure of just being there. As usual, Sydney FC leant on marquee man, but Newcastle were without Emile Heskey and it showed. Lacking a strong presence up front, Gary van Egmond's side looked stuck in a training ground possession drill, lacking leadership and struggling to create any meaningful chances. One shot on target in 90 minutes of football is laughable, particularly against a Sydney FC defence that has leaked goals throughout the pre-season. Last season Newcastle didn't play great football, but at least they could just lump it to Heskey and let him do the rest. </p><p>In truth, the best thing we can say about the Jets is their players have great haircuts. They might be coming in from the sticks, but Scott Neville, Connor Chapman, James Brown, Adam Taggart, Mark Birighitti and Josh Brillante certainly showed the city boys how to side-part. On the park, however, they looked shaky. That might be just start-of-season cobwebs, but the Hunter hipsters impromptu coffee binge at an afternoon cupping session should also come under some scrutiny. </p><p>Zenon Caravella, who was a breath of fresh air coming into the Newcastle squad midway through last season, <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/farinas-nephew-signs-with-enemy/story-e6freon6-1111118171170\">did Uncle Frank Farina</a> a favour on 36 minutes with some slapstick defending to gift Del Piero the opening goal. Unsurprisingly, he was the first one pulled by Van Egmond. There's only so much frothing one can do over one average hit-out, but with Heskey out injured for at least another three weeks, the omens aren't altogether positive. Don't be surprised if Michael Bridges, who is returning from injury, is drafted in next week to give the Jets a little more direction up front.</p><h2>Duke and Jurić should both be in the Socceroos squad</h2><p>A racy headline, to be sure. Both Tomi Juric and Mitchell Duke are still very green at 22, between them only boasting a handful of appearances in the A-League. But after they scored a goal apiece in the best match of the round between Central Coast Mariners and Western Sydney Wanderers, we were given a glimpse into the future. </p><p>They say that strikers are worth their weight in gold, but until recently Australia's stocks have looked as barren as the fields at Hill End. With every passing tournament, Australia have struggled to adequately fill the gaping hole left by Mark Viduka. Not that Holger Osieck, and Pim Verbeek before him, haven't tried to find a replacement. Harry Kewell, Scott McDonald, Josh Kennedy, Brett Holman and Alex Brosque have all been tried and found wanting. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/football/porta-could-be-back-in-the-socceroos-fold-20110403-1csz2.html\">The indecision has brought us to a situation where unknown Uruguayans have been bandied about as potential saviours</a>, and in the search for the next Mark Viduka, we'd be happy to settle at least on another Clayton Zane. </p><p>The best thing about Juric and Duke is they play with a swagger that belies their years. They constantly demand the ball and have the physical and technical abilities to warrant inclusion in the Socceroos. Osieck experimented with Juric and Duke in the East Asian Cup in July, and they immediately repaid his faith. With the national team at a low point, it's an option worth exploring for whoever becomes the new coach. Having Duke and Juric at two of the best clubs in the country also helps. While Juric didn't start on Saturday evening, expect him to lead the line more often than not for the Wanderers, while Graham Arnold has made no secret of his excitement over Duke. </p><h2>Physicality killed the Melbourne derby</h2><p>Despite the introduction of the Western Sydney Wanderers, the Melbourne derby is still the biggest in the competition. The fixture regularly attracts 40,000 fans to Etihad Stadium, which is both a tremendous boost for the clubs and the competition. With Harry \"who are Melbourne Heart?\" Kewell back in town, there was perhaps a little more feeling in this derby than in previous years. As much as Kewell pulls a crowd, his on-field histrionics make him an easy player to hate, and the Victory fans have quickly cast him as a pantomime villain. </p><p>But in front of a huge crowd and with a sense of expectation, the players failed to deliver. Melbourne Victory missed the magic of Marco Rojas and Archie Thompson was quiet, while Melbourne Heart are still very much a work in progress with a brand new midfield and centre-back partnership. With neither side at their best, the physicality of the contest soon detracted from the spectacle. Harry Kewell had to be bandaged up after copping a stray elbow from Adrian Leijer, while Heart's new Italian signing Andrea Migliorini was given an Australian welcome from Leigh Broxham in the opening minutes. The most cynical foul, however, arrived early in the second half, as the surly looking Victory defender Pablo Contreas gave Aziz Behich a casual off the ball elbow to the face. The Heart players reacted angrily, but referee Peter Green was looking the other way and the linesman too busy line-dancing to notice. As is so often the case, a big game ended in a scrappy hack-fest.</p><h2>The Latin Americans shone</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/06/a-league-preview-adelaide-united\">As I commented last week in my pissants preview,</a> we've not been big on Latin types in the A-League. Too often, South Americans have arrived promising style and swagger, before being found out as panel beaters and pretenders. The passport has fooled people who've watched <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gOosl1SeeA\">too many Nike ads on YouTube</a> on more than occasion. Remember Edmundo Zura? Leandro Love? Patrick? Cleberson? <a href=\"http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4021/a-league/2012/07/23/3259323/red-faces-as-adelaide-united-fooled-by-phantom-trialist\">Even better, Dexter Rosales?</a> At least he sounded like a footballer. Forget them again. They're best left on the scrapheap of A-League history. However, if round one was anything to go by, this could be the season that changes all that. </p><p>It started with everybody's favourite Argentinian, Marcos Flores, who is at his third club in as many seasons in the A-League. After being deemed surplus to requirements at Melbourne Victory by Ange Postecoglou, Flores has taken <a href=\"http://www.mfootball.com.au/flores-tweets-mysterious-messages-about-future/\">his giraffe hashtags</a>, <a href=\"http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/centralcoastmariners/news-display/La-Bamba/75769\">terrible singing</a>, and delightful right foot to Gosford. On his debut, Flores's point and pass to <a href=\"http://video.news.com.au/v/137431/Marcos-magic-for-Mariners\">set up Mitchell Duke with the Mariners' first goal  </a>was the highlight of the match, and showed that he will be a more than capable replacement for Tom Rogić in the No10 role. Not to be outdone, in Wellington Carlos Hernandez was terrific on debut for the Phoenix. On 26 minutes, his little shimmy through three defenders on the right touchline showed that Wellington might be able to do more than just boot it to Paul Ifill. Meanwhile, in Adelaide, Argentinian striker Jeronimo Neumann was the star of the show with two goals, while Brazilian winger Sidnei Sciola – who commentator Michael Cockerill seemed determined to call 'Sydney' – looks to be a terrific pick-up by Alistair Edwards at Perth Glory.  </p><h2>The crowds turned up</h2><p>Counting crowds is one of our favourite things to do in the A-League. From the first round of the competition in 2005, we've been watching the turnstiles, gloating and angst-ridden as crowds swell and dip. Last season saw crowds rise as <a href=\"http://leopoldmethod.com.au/lets-take-a-look-at-these-numbers-more-closely-2/\">the Del Piero effect</a> took hold and every man and <a href=\"http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx116/matthewbrala/380639_217596485042227_1805775232_n_zps9de6e3c3.jpg\">his novelty postcode</a> jumped aboard the Western Sydney Wanderers bandwagon. We were happy. No more did we have to deal with billionaires <a href=\"http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/gold-coast-united-chairman-clive-palmer-plans-to-limit-crowd-to-5000-at-skilled-park/story-e6frep5o-1225764125347\">closing off half their club's stadium to save a few bucks on public transport</a>. This season, according to everybody, is going to be the best ever. We've still got Delps, Adelaide are going to become Barcelona, the Wanderers are going to sell out Parramatta Stadium every week, Kewell is going to make Melbourne take notice of the Heart and SBS will give everyone a reason to not go out on Friday night. </p><p>How SBS's live telecast will affect historically touch-and-go Friday night crowd figures remains to be seen, but the good news is the A-League broke two attendance records this weekend. The first was on Saturday night, as 45,202 people packed in for the Melbourne derby, which is the highest yet for a game between the two sides. The second, more important figure was that the weekends cumulative attendance cracked the 100,000 mark, making it the most-watched round yet in A-League history. Strong crowds in Sydney, Melbourne and Gosford helped push crowds up, and for those who couldn't get off the couch, the SBS-Fox Sports partnership yielded the highest television audience for an A-League match. The A-League is far from perfect, but for now, people are voting with their feet, wallets and remote controls.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419830872|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|b8084320a8ac6928ebebec8114f1b6ddb6a12449 -->",

        "body":"<p>Brisbane Roar midfielder Ivan Franjic broke Wellington Phoenix hearts with a 90th-minute strike to seal a 2-1 win in their A-League season opener.</p><p>The game looked destined for a draw until Franjic and Thomas Broich combined to slice open the tiring Wellington defence. Broich's initial shot ricocheted off the upright, but Franjic made no mistake with his follow up to slam home the winner.</p><p>The new Phoenix coach, Ernie Merrick, missing six front-line players to international duties and injury, would have been happy with the draw but the result was a fair one for Brisbane, who had the upper hand in the second half.</p><p>Stand-in skipper Ben Sigmund's vision set up the Phoenix's goal after 22 minutes, his raking cross-field ball nodded down by Michael Boxall for the former Belgian international Stein Huysegems to calmly slot home.</p><p>Franjic nearly equalised two minutes later, allowing too much time and room in front and it took a Sigmund deflection to tip his shot onto the upright with keeper Jacob Spoonley beaten.</p><p>The Phoenix continued to create chances, Manny Muscat looking long to find Kenny Cunningham on the edge of the box in the 38th minute. The Costa Rican international did well to outmuscle Shane Stefanutto only for Michael Theo to smother the shot.</p><p>The Roar continued to build pressure as halftime approached, switching play from side to side and forcing their first corner of the game right on 45 minutes.<br />The ball fell wide to Franjic, who showed good strength in the tackle to turn and centre for Besart Berisha to nod home. But the offside flag spared Phoenix, and the home team went into the break 1-0 up.</p><p>It took less than a minute after the restart for Brisbane to equalise as the Wellington defence dozed, Franjic again key with a jinking run down the right which ended in a pinpoint cross for Berisha to drill home.</p><p>Franjic was an ever-present danger throughout the game, finding time and space to create opportunities, and finishing with venom when given half a chance just as the Phoenix looked to have secured the draw.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419817652|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|1f564e1b673720c79dc6a5a107083c73444abfc0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The hand of Melbourne Heart&rsquo;s Patrick Kisnorbo saved his club in a scoreless derby against Melbourne Victory.</p> <p>In a match attended by 45,202 fans at Etihad Stadium and in which six yellow cards were handed out, the biggest talking point came in the 47th minute, when anguished Victory cries for handball were ignored.</p> <p>A seemingly goal-bound shot from the Victory's Adama Traore was stopped by Kisnorbo.</p> <p>Replays showed his left hand was away from his body when the ball struck it, but the Victory protests were waved away by the referee Peter Green.</p> <p>It was part of a concerted Victory second-half effort to clinch three points, with the nominal home side doing most of the attacking after halftime.</p> <p>In the first half, it had been the Heart which had looked the more threatening, particularly on the counter-attack.</p> <p>The pace of David Williams and Golgol Mebrahtu looked capable of piercing the Victory defence, while new Heart captain Harry Kewell produced some clever set-up work against his former club.</p> <p>The Heart's Mate Dugandzic sprayed an open chance in the 11th minute, after Williams' pace allowed him to get clear and make a nice cross.</p> <p>Mebrahtu broke onto a Harry Kewell through-ball to get past advancing keeper Nathan Coe 10 minutes later, but couldn't balance himself well enough to get a shot past two Victory defenders.</p> <p>Kewell, who regularly copped loud booing from the pro-Victory crowd, needed a bandage on a cut above an eye after a first-half clash with former teammate Adrian Leijer contesting a header.</p> <p>But his class showed late in the half. Kewell just missed with a long-range shot, latching on to a loose ball after a Leijer attempted clearance rebounded off a teammate five minutes from halftime.</p> <p>In the last minute of the half, a Kewell header from a long, high ball found the feet of Mebrahtu, who spun and shot but was just off target. Kewell was subbed off midway through the second half.</p> <p>&bull; A late goal from substitute Tomi Juric earned the Western Sydney Wanderers a point against Central Coast as last season's A-League grand finalists slugged their way to a 1-1 draw.</p> <p>Former Adelaide striker Juric, who was raised in Sydney's western suburbs, marked his Wanderers debut in style in front of more than 17,000 fans in warm conditions.</p> <p>He slammed home a close-range volley off a delightful cross from winger Youssouf Hersi in the 87th minute at Bluetongue Stadium.</p> <p>It cancelled out an equally well-taken and constructed goal from Socceroo striker Mitchell Duke in the 55th minute.</p> <p>Duke, another product of Sydney's west, chipped the ball across goalkeeper Ante Covic into the far corner after being put through by a sublime pass from playmaker Marcos Flores.</p> <p>The two teams boasted easily the tightest defences in last season's competition and both again looked strong at the back.</p> <p>Clear-cut chances were at a premium in the first half, with Wanderers creating the best openings against a Mariners team including just four of their grand final starting line-up.</p> <p>Hersi blazed over from close range after outstanding Mariners goalkeeper Justin Pasfield saved two shots in quick succession from Bridge.</p> <p>With Flores becoming progressively more influential the Mariners looked far more threatening in a more open second half that produced more chances at both ends.</p> <p>\"It was a good point, we were disappointed we didn't keep the three,\" Mariners coach Graham Arnold said. \"We're still a work in progress</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419777563|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|61091bee0401751450dda7706d546ea5c75a6d13 -->",

Chianese had a shot blocked by Birighitti in a one-on-one situation created by a Del Piero pass.</p><p>Former Newcastle player Matt Thompson almost marked his Sydney debut with a goal when his shot crashed off the crossbar and then bounced off Birighitti's back.</p><p>Becoming progressively more involved, Del Piero sent a wicked drive just over the bar a few seconds before half-time.</p><p>The Jets showed some nice touches early on through Nathan Burns, James Virgili and Craig Goodwin, but didn't create any good first half chances.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419698963|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|1c21c1e1d5a87c644e9f1294befc80084880d670 -->",

Oh, and afternoon (USA), welcome to our live-ish coverage of the A-League season opener starring Italian football's No1 Oasis fan Alessandro Del Piero. And not Emile Heskey because he's hurt his knee and his mum says he's not allowed out until later.</p> <p>Not that Emile is the only with jiggered bones: Michael Bridges, Brett Emerton, Terry Antonis and Corey Gameiro are among the other walking wounded.</p> <p>Now as zippy as Sydney are in attack, they don't really &quot;do&quot; defending which can be somewhat of a disadvantage in football. They've also been distinctly so-so in pre-season (although they didn't do too badly in their tour of Italy) and are still adapting to playing 4-3-3 regularly. Having said all that, Newcastle are can't attack <em>or</em> defend so that's 1-0 to Sydney. And, in fact, that is my prediction for this evening's game.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419673830|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|3a05e01f2c592c4c2b060059cc6467beb52882b1 -->",

They are, according to everybody, the greatest thing to happen to Australian football since <a href=\"http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/worldcup/timeline.shtml\">John Walter Fletcher decided to organise a kick-about between two schools in Sydney in 1880</a>. Or whatever. </p><p>The A-League's \"newest oldest club\" will enter A-League 9.0 with high expectations. In their first season, they won the premiership, attracted a colourful and parochial mix of active fans, who, when they are not silent-protesting canteen price hikes and people who don't indicate at roundabouts, create the best atmosphere of any team in the competition. And despite the fact they lost the grand final to the Central Coast Mariners, memberships have had to be capped to allow a little room for the day-trippers and away fans. </p><p>In a competition comprised of small squads levelled out by a salary cap, it is the consistent teams that succeed, and last season the Wanderers played their hand perfectly. Headed by Tony Popovic, the coaching staff managed the team with authority, limiting injuries and rotating players to create a sense of cohesion for both the regular starters and squad players. As a result, the Wanderers began to peak at just the right moment, going undefeated for their last 12 matches to take out the premiership in March.</p><p>Perhaps the most encouraging sign of the Wanderers breakthrough season was the renaissance in the careers of A-League journeymen Michael Beauchamp, Nikolai Topor-Stanley, Ante Covic and Mark Bridge, as well as the successful repatriation of Aaron Mooy from St Mirren in Scotland. Popovic and Ante Milicic crafted a team out of the dregs and leftovers of other A-League squads, in the process making more than a few other clubs look silly, and creating an 'underdog' culture at the club. They are Wanderers by name, Wanderers by nature. </p><p>However, despite the success of the club both on and off the field, their second season will present quite different challenges. Last year, fans only expected the Wanderers to make up the numbers and restore some credibility to a competition reeling after two successive expansion failures in Queensland. All players, aside from the captain, Beauchamp, and marquee player Shinji Ono, were signed to one-year contracts, and expectations were meagre at best.</p><p>This season the Wanderers will be one of the teams to beat. Their tactics will have been studied intently by rival coaches in the off-season to search for weaknesses to exploit, while every team will lift in their presence. Moreover, Popovic will have to regenerate his squad, which he has made a good start on during the winter break.</p><p>Both Joey Gibbs and Dino Kresinger have been shown the door, while Tomi Juric and Brendon Santalab have been signed in their places. The jury is still out on former Sydney FC striker Santalab, but Juric already looks a natural fit in the Wanderers line-up. Big, strong and mobile, Juric will be groomed as the centre-forward who can score goals as well as holding up the ball for speedy wingers, and creative midfielder Ono. Under the guidance of former goal-shark Milicic, don't be surprised if this is a breakthrough season for Jurić, who has tentatively been dubbed 'the next Mark Viduka' and attracted the attention of the Socceroos coach Holger Osieck.</p><p>But for all the changes up front, the Wanderers will once again be looking to build their season on a solid defensive foundation. Dean Heffernan and Matthew Spiranovic have both signed with the Wanderers, adding depth across the backline. Last season the Wanderers conceded the fewest goals of any team, with Topor-Stanley and Beauchamp forming a formidable partnership in central defence. The two centre-backs, who between them have traversed six A-League clubs in just eight seasons, were like that unlikely couple in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCObON5sJzU\">John Prine and Iris DeMent's famous duet, In Spite of Ourselves</a>. The roles of John and Iris are yet to be determined, but Topor-Stanley surely has dibs on the <a href=\"https://m.ak.fbcdn.net/sphotos-a.ak/hphotos-ak-prn1/1237870_576978559032816_447069765_n.jpg\">\"whacked out weirdo and lovebug junkie\"</a>.</p><p>This season takes on an extra dimension, as the Wanderers enter the Asian Champions League in early 2014. If Popovic can continue his success in Western Sydney, he'll surely become a target for overseas clubs, as will many of his players. Foiled by the Central Coast Mariners in the grand final in April, the Wanderers will have their sights firmly set on silverware. Only time will tell if second-season blues catch up with them.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419551733|2013-10-17T10:28:07Z|5d31d8e767dcccf6433ef5cacd0564f6e3b6bbe9 -->",
