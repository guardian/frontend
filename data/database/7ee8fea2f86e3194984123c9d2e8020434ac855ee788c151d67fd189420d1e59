We expect that to happen in 2015.”</p> <p>Corrigan added: “That obligation is clear in international law. This means that marriage should be available to same-sex couples in Northern Ireland, just as it is now in Scotland, England and Wales.</p> <p>“There is still a chance for Northern Ireland’s politicians to do the right thing in 2015. However, if they continue to abdicate their responsibilities, judges instead will be asked to uphold the right of all our citizens not to face discrimination.”</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/16/ireland-gay-marriage-referendum-may\" title=\"\">Irish Republic is to hold a referendum</a> this spring on legalising gay marriage in the state. If, as successive opinion polls suggest, the republic backs full equality for same-sex marriage, it will leave Northern Ireland as the only part of these islands where gay marriage is not given equal status.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the honours list for Northern Ireland included an MBE for a Ballymena councillor who stated that hurricane Katrina was God’s revenge for an annual gay event called the Southern Decadence festival.</p> <p>On the 2005 disaster which killed 1,300 people and left tens of thousands homeless, Democratic Unionist councillor Maurice Mills said: “The media failed to report that the hurricane occurred just two days prior to the annual homosexual event called the Southern Decadence festival which the previous year had attracted an estimated 125,000 people,” said Mills.</p> <p>“Surely this is a warning to nations where such wickedness is increasingly promoted and practised.”</p> <p>Mills also blamed the spread of Aids in Africa on gay people. “This abominable and filthy practice of sodomy has resulted in the great continent of Africa being riddled with Aids,” he said.</p> <p>The gay rights organisation the Rainbow Project demanded that his party reject Mills’s comments but the DUP declined to do so. The DUP councillor has never retracted his remarks.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935482","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216689","internalRevision":"6","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Rights group makes prediction in new year message as Irish Republic gears up for spring referendum on legalising gay marriage","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Northern Ireland gay marriage ban will see legal challenge in 2015 – Amnesty","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T14:18:18.296Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035347913/Gay-wedding-cake-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gjg","wordcount":"404","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035347913/Gay-wedding-cake-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a40447e4b0fa04a20dc013","internalStoryPackageCode":"83517","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T14:18:18Z","standfirst":"Rights group makes prediction in new year message as Irish Republic gears up for spring referendum on legalising gay marriage","linkText":"Northern Ireland gay marriage ban will see legal challenge in 2015 – Amnesty","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T14:21:42.000Z","internalContentCode":"454069794"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/northern-ireland-gay-marriage-ban-legal-challenge-2015-amnesty","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/northern-ireland-gay-marriage-ban-legal-challenge-2015-amnesty","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"413a0eec473cd3f71b7e2f7f26d2dc7ddbe519bd","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035352864/Gay-wedding-cake-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*47336843","suppliersReference":"D4A7AP","altText":"Gay wedding cake","caption":"Gay wedding cake.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Lady Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the appeal court judge forced to stand down as chair of the government child abuse inquiry, has said she fears the government will never be able to find an experienced figure to run the investigation, but that victims should not think they can do it.</p> <p>Butler-Sloss was forced to stand down as the chair of the broad inquiry into child abuse in July because her late brother Sir Michael Havers had been attorney general in the 1980s and his actions would have been subject to investigation by the inquiry.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday she said she was adamant that the establishment had covered up its role in child abuse. “I do believe the establishment has in the past looked after itself, partly because people did not really recognise the seriousness of child abuse and they did not think it was so important, and it was important to protect members of the establishment.</p> <p>“So I would want to go in with a knife and cut the whole thing open and expose it, bearing in mind of course that the views of those people are different to people today. That is a difficulty, but I don’t believe I was unsuitable to do it because as a judge with 35 years’ experience on the bench I was quite able to be independent and say that people got it wrong and be critical of them.”</p> <p>She said that would be true even if some of the people she had to criticise were close to her. “That is the way I was trained,” she insisted, but added, “I absolutely understand the public do not believe it.”</p> <p>Asked if the stalled inquiry will ever get under way, she said: “I worry that the victims and survivors – for who I have the most enormous sympathy, and as a judge I tried a great many child abuse cases – for them to be deciding who should be the person chairing it creates real problems.”</p> <p>She suggested that anyone qualified to chair such an inquiry would have experience that would lead him or her to be branded as being part of the establishment.</p> <p>“If you do not have in the past a position of authority, how are you going to be able to run the inquiry? You are going to need someone who knows how to run things and if you get someone with an obscure background with no background of establishment, they will find it very difficult and may not be able to produce the goods.”</p> <p>She agreed that the normal processes of sifting of evidence and neutrality between accuser and accused might go by the board if the victims were allowed to dominate.</p> <p>“Of course the victims are at the centre of this, as Theresa May said – it is hugely to her credit that she wanted this inquiry – but if the victims are to run it, then there will be real difficulties.”</p> <p>She said there had to be victim representation on the panel, but they should not chair it.</p> <p>Butler-Sloss said she felt it was her duty to have accepted the invitation from the home secretary to chair the panel. “I think, without sounding arrogant, that I could probably have done the job.” But, she added, she was glad to not have to do it now.</p> <p>Butler-Sloss resigned in July from the post, making the following statement: “It has become apparent over the last few days … that there is a widespread perception, particularly among victim and survivor groups, that I am not the right person to chair the inquiry. It has also become clear to me that I did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties.</p> <p>“This is a victim-orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government. Having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of MPs and the media, I have come to the conclusion that I should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the home secretary.”</p> <p>Butler-Sloss also defended her ability to investigate abuse in the church, saying she had investigated two churchmen who had not been found guilty of any offences but she believed needed to be looked at. Since then some of them had come before the courts.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934926","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216570","internalRevision":"12","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Judge forced to stand down as chair of government panel expresses fears that acceptable replacement may not be found","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Butler-Sloss: victims should not run child abuse inquiry","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Patrick Wintour, political editor","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T10:12:11.812Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420020635374/Dame-Elizabeth-Butler-Slo-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gf5","wordcount":"746","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420020635374/Dame-Elizabeth-Butler-Slo-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a3ca86e4b084424a7b2e38","internalStoryPackageCode":"83628","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T10:12:12Z","standfirst":"Judge forced to stand down as chair of government panel expresses fears that acceptable replacement may not be found","linkText":"Butler-Sloss: victims should not run child abuse inquiry","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T16:08:44.000Z","internalContentCode":"454059671"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/31/butler-sloss-victims-not-run-child-abuse-inquiry","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2014/dec/31/butler-sloss-victims-not-run-child-abuse-inquiry","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"05e5cb87ccec2cb3250aef9f18c4d9cd9ae9b21b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420020640669/Dame-Elizabeth-Butler-Slo-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"GD*45334113","suppliersReference":"POLITICS_Paedophile_104741.JPG","altText":"Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss","caption":"Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss said she believed she would have done a good job as chair of the child abuse inquiry.

The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/11187285/Tony-Blair-Miliband-has-failed-to-connect-with-voters-and-is-doomed-to-election-defeat.html\" title=\"\">report in the Daily Telegraph</a> said Blair had told long-standing political allies that David Cameron would remain in power next year because Labour had not persuaded Britain it is ready to govern.</p> <p>Labour sources pointed out that Blair had said something similar in an earlier interview with Progress magazine, the journal of centrist Labour supporters.</p> <p>In the magazine he is reported as saying he is convinced that a third way emphasis on “strong values, but practical, non-ideological solutions” is “definitely where people are”, even if, he argues, “it’s often not where political parties are because they want to appeal to their activists”.</p> <p>But he argues that Labour should beware: “There’s a huge desire in a large part of the media in this country to return British politics to a traditional Tory party fighting a traditional Labour party.” Such a contest, the only man who has led Labour to victory in the last 40 years concludes grimly, always results in “a traditional result”.</p> <p>Miliband continues to enjoy a lead in almost every opinion poll, with most suggesting Labour will at least be the largest party after next year’s election.</p> <p>However, some senior Labour figures are worried about Miliband’s low personal popularity ratings and the fact he is trailing behind Cameron in terms of confidence in his running of the economy.</p> <p>Lucy Powell, the party’s vice-chairman of the election campaign, said she respected Blair but the solutions he provided in the nineties were right for that era when she said it seemed right to leave capitalism alone to provide resources for public services such as education.</p> <p>She told the BBC World at One: “He has his experience from his era. That is not the era we now live in.”</p> <p>But she added that for most voters phrases such as left and right meant little. She said that since the crash it had been proved necessary to intervene, but denied Labour had alienated business, pointing out that Miliband’s speech to the CBI with a strong pro-European message had proved more popular with business than that of David Cameron, who spoke on the same day.</p> <p>David Lammy, a candidate to stand for Labour to be London mayor, said Labour needed to listen to Blair’s warnings.</p> <p>“I don’t think anyone should underestimate a leader of the Labour party who won three consecutive elections and fought hard to make Labour electable again after 18 years in opposition. So of course we should take what Tony Blair is saying very seriously indeed.”</p> <p>Lammy said he agreed with Blair that Labour could not offer only a “traditional leftwing” platform at the next election.</p> <p>“It’s clear that post the crash in 2008, it may well be that the British public’s mood and temperament might appear more leftwing than was the case in the past. So clearly energy freezing is important to the electorate, but I think it is also true that the Labour party has to be the party of aspiration; we should not cede this ground to the Conservatives.”</p> <p>He also endorsed Blair’s call for Labour not to alienate businesses, but pointed to the party’s pro-European stance, adding that Labour was ahead in the polls.</p> <p>Blair’s comments have overshadowed Miliband’s new year message to the electorate, in which he promised a recovery that “reaches your kitchen table” and urged the country to choose a “new beginning” in 2015.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2014/dec/31/labour-ed-miliband-new-year-message-2015-cost-living-crisis-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/44ggb\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2216603\"            data-video-name=\"Ed Miliband's new year message: I promise to address cost of living crisis - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Other\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/12/31/1420025296931/crop_KP-61826_640.jpeg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-454062467\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/12/31/1420025295048/crop_KP-61826_1200.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/31/141231Miliband_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/31/141231Miliband_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/31/141231Miliband.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/31/141231Miliband_large.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/31/141231Miliband_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Ed Miliband’s new year message</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Miliband’s festive message, apparently recorded at his home, shows the Labour leader flanked by a Christmas tree and casually dressed in a shirt and navy blue jumper.</p> <p>The message was heavily influenced by David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama, hired by Miliband as a strategic adviser for the election campaign, and was designed not to be negative in its tone.</p> <p>Miliband said: “This is the season for new beginnings and hopes for the future.</p> <p>“And Britain is ready for a new beginning. Because I don’t have to tell you that, all over our country today, there are people working harder and harder, but standing still: families struggling with bills that are growing faster than their wages; young people, taking on mountains of debt to get a proper education, only to find themselves with no job at the other end; and an NHS where people are waiting longer and longer to get the care they need.</p> <p>“It doesn’t have to be this way. As this new year dawns, we have the chance to change direction.”</p> <p>Miliband said he stood for a “new plan that cuts our deficit responsibly, without threatening our NHS or short-changing our children and their future”.</p> <p>“This year, we have the power to bring about the change working families all over Britain need. This isn’t about idle dreams or empty promises. It’s about a real, concrete plan: a plan for a recovery which reaches your kitchen table.”</p> <p>Miliband said that in the runup to the election he would be setting out ideas to raise wages, give young people more opportunities, “set fair rules for immigration” and “rescue our NHS”.</p> <p>“We have it within our grasp not just to see out the old year but to see out the old ways of running the country,” he said.</p> <p>“Can we do it? Of course we can.”</p> <p>Miliband is also facing some criticism about a lack of diversity among candidates in winnable seats. Research found just one candidate out of those in 34 seats where an incumbent MP is retiring is from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background.</p> <p>Separately, Ian Lavery, Labour MP for Wansbeck in Northumberland, has been <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11319420/Labour-elite-thinks-Northerners-are-stupid-MP-complains.html\" title=\"\">quoted by the Telegraph</a> as telling a party event that an elite in Westminster looked down on his accent.</p> <p>He is reported to have said: “We haven’t got enough ethnic minorities, we haven’t got enough disabled people in, who have actually been there. We’ve got an elite in, we’ve got an elite in Westminster which quite frankly frightens me. They haven’t been anywhere or done anything, and when you’ve got an accent like mine they think: ‘Well, that man doesn’t really know too much.’”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934977","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216583","internalRevision":"64","publication":"The

tending the grave of a British man who died in obscurity, a Japanese family has finally learned his identity – and received an official message of thanks from the British government.</p> <p>For much of that period, members of the Murai family, who live in Ishikawa prefecture on the Japan Sea coast, thought they were maintaining the last resting place of a man named Philip Ward.</p> <p>In fact, the grave belongs to Bernard George Littlewood, who came to Japan to teach English in 1870, just as the country was beginning to modernise. </p> <p>Littlewood taught English at a school in what is now the city of Kaga, but died of smallpox the following year, aged just 30, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.</p> <p>Local officials erected a tombstone for Littlewood at a Buddhist temple, but months later, when feudal domains were replaced with prefectures, no one was given responsibility for its upkeep.</p> <p>The Murai family, who lived nearby, decided to clean and weed the area themselves, a routine they continued throughout the second world war. Years later, the family received a letter from the British embassy thanking them for tending what was believed to be Ward’s grave.</p> <p>It was not until Susumu Koyata, a volunteer who promotes international exchange in the city, researched the grave’s history that its occupant’s true identity emerged.</p> <p>Koyata attributed the confusion to the tombstone’s engraving, which was etched in Kanji characters, making it difficult to pronounce.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Kumiko Murai received a second letter of thanks from the British embassy thanking her for her family’s modest tribute to a forgotten expatriate.</p> <p>Murai, 81, told the Asahi she had been “speechless” when the letter arrived from the current UK ambassador to Tokyo, Timothy Hitchens, who thanked her family for their kindness and for contributing to friendly ties between Japan and Britain.</p> <p>The job was not without controversy, however. Murai recalled her father-in-law saying that the family had had a “hard time” during the war due to their insistence on maintaining the grave of a citizen of Japan’s then enemy.</p> <p>Her 58-year-old son, Yasushi, will carry on the family tradition, she told the paper.</p>","productionOffice":"AUS","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216536","internalRevision":"201","publication":"The

At one point, there were 12 Tunisian inmates.<br /></p> <p>Yemeni detainees are the largest group at Guantánamo, with 80 inmates identified as Yemeni nationals, of which 50 are considered ready to be transferred. But US authorities have concerns over security given the volatile situation in Yemen.<br /></p> <p>The Pentagon identified the Tunisian nationals transferred on Tuesday as Adel Al-Hakeemy and Abdullah Bin Ali Al-Lufti, also known as Lofti Bin Ali.<br /></p> <p>Authorities had approved the repatriation of Ali in 2006, but a US federal judge in 2007 blocked his transfer, saying he would likely face torture and “irreparable harm” at the hands of Tunisian authorities. <br /></p> <p>Ali, 49, has a pacemaker, suffers heart rhythm problems and takes blood thinning medication. He has strongly denied having any links to al-Qaida and insisted he had travelled to Pakistan to buy medicine when he was arrested by authorities there after 9/11.<br /></p> <p>His compatriot, Hakeemy, also known as Hkiml, 49, had been described by US authorities as a “veteran terrorist” who had allegedly taken part in fighting in Bosnia and was accused of links with an Algerian Islamist group. <br /></p> <p>But he has maintained he was working as a cook in Italy and had gone to Pakistan to find a wife. He was arrested by Pakistani authorities near the Afghan border and held at Guantánamo for more than 12 years.<br /></p> <p>Both he and his fellow Tunisian detainee had lived in Italy as immigrants. <br /></p> <p>The three Yemenis who were transferred were identified as Asim Thabit Abdullah Al-Khalaqi, Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna and Sabri Muhammad Ibrahim Al Qurashi.<br /></p> <p>Khalaqi, 46, born in Saudi Arabia, had been suspected of serving in Osama bin Laden’s Arab brigade. <br /></p> <p>Arrested in December 2001 in the company of a senior al-Qaida figure, he has been behind bars at Guantánamo since 17 January 2002, among the first inmates to be sent to the prison at Guantánamo Bay. <br /></p> <p>The second Yemeni to be transferred out is Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna, 46, also known as Muhammed Ali Hussein Khnenah, who has been held at the prison since June 2002.<br /></p> <p>He was arrested at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in December 2001. US authorities alleged he was present at Bin Laden’s hideout in the Tora Bora mountains and that he had stayed at guesthouses known to serve al-Qaida extremists.<br /></p> <p>The third Yemeni detainee transferred was Sabri Muhammad Ibrahim Al Qurashi, 44, who had been suspected of membership in al-Qaida and undergoing instruction at one of the group’s training camps. He was arrested by Pakistani authorities at a known al-Qaida safe house in February 2002 and was sent to Guantánamo in May of that year.<br /></p> <p>The transfers came just days after Obama’s envoy overseeing the release of Guantánamo inmates, Cliff Sloan, resigned from his post. Sloan had reportedly become frustrated at the slow pace of transfers, which have to be approved by the Pentagon.<br /></p> <p>Outgoing Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, who resigned in November, had reportedly come under pressure from the White House to move more swiftly to approve proposed transfers of detainees.</p> <p><br /></p>","productionOffice":"AUS","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216533","internalRevision":"283","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The release of three Yemenis and two Tunisians held for more than a decade marks a renewed push to close the military prison","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Five Guantánamo prisoners flown to Kazakhstan for resettlement","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Agence France-Presse","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T05:12:56.134Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420002128173/89c92c2e-96e4-449e-bd0d-d2ed684349f5-140x84.jpeg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gdm","wordcount":"781","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420002128173/89c92c2e-96e4-449e-bd0d-d2ed684349f5-140x84.jpeg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a38196e4b048dfa4053ab6","newspaperPageNumber":"20","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T16:15:00+11:00","standfirst":"<p>The release of three Yemenis and two Tunisians held for more than a decade marks a renewed push to close the military prison</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/07/guantanamo-bay-prisoners-transferred-uruguay\">Six Guantánamo prisoners sent to Uruguay</a><br></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/obama-considers-transfer-guantanamo-detainees\">Obama considers transfer of more Guantánamo detainees</a><br></li></ul>","linkText":"Five Guantánamo prisoners flown to Kazakhstan for resettlement","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-03-03T11:39:42.000Z","internalContentCode":"454054649"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/31/five-guantanamo-prisoners-flown-to-kazakhstan-for-resettlement","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2014/dec/31/five-guantanamo-prisoners-flown-to-kazakhstan-for-resettlement","sectionName":"US news","elements":[{"id":"gu-video-419505738","relation":"main","type":"video","assets":[{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation-16x9.mp4","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-419505738","durationMinutes":"6","durationSeconds":"3","caption":"Guantánamo Bay: the hunger strikes, an animation ","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3jdhy","secureFile":"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation-16x9.mp4"},"mimeType":"video/mp4"},{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation_3gpSml16x9.3gp","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-419505738","durationMinutes":"6","durationSeconds":"3","caption":"Guantánamo Bay: the hunger strikes, an animation ","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3jdhy","secureFile":"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation_3gpSml16x9.3gp"},"mimeType":"video/3gpp:small"},{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation_3gpLg16x9.3gp","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-419505738","durationMinutes":"6","durationSeconds":"3","caption":"Guantánamo Bay: the hunger strikes, an animation ","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3jdhy","secureFile":"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation_3gpLg16x9.3gp"},"mimeType":"video/3gpp:large"},{"type":"video","file":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation/131009GuantanamoAnimation.m3u8","typeData":{"source":"guardian.co.uk","embeddable":"true","blockAds":"false","mediaId":"gu-video-419505738","durationMinutes":"6","durationSeconds":"3","caption":"Guantánamo Bay: the hunger strikes, an animation ","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3jdhy","secureFile":"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/10/9/131009GuantanamoAnimation/131009GuantanamoAnimation.m3u8"},"mimeType":"video/m3u8"},{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/9/1381331085912/Guantanamo-prison-prisone-001.jpg","typeData":{"mediaId":"gu-video-419505738","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/10/9/1381331085912/Guantanamo-prison-prisone-001.jpg","width":"640","height":"360","source":"guardian.co.uk","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"Guantanamo prison, prisoner force feeding animation","caption":"Actual information from within Guantanamo Bay is a scarce commodity.

Photograph: Interfoto Pressebildagentur/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Before we leave the centenary year of the outbreak of war in 1914 there’s someone we should talk about. Everyone now knows about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/16/truce-trenches-football-tales-shot-in-dark\" title=\"\">famous Christmas truce</a> and football matches. But this was a war that was meant to have been “over by Christmas” 1914, not dragging on for four blood-soaked years. Plenty share blame for that, but one major culprit who seems to have been conspicuous by his absence in 2014 deserves a name check: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck\" title=\"\">Otto von Bismarck</a>.</p> <p>I’m astonished by this. Cynical and brilliant, an empire-builder who proclaimed the supremacy of “iron and blood” – actually it was his friend, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krupp#Alfred_Krupp\" title=\"\">Alfred (“Cannon King”) Krupp’s</a> new guns made of <em>steel</em> that shed the blood – the Prussian chief minister turned first pan-German chancellor became the dominant European statesman of the 19th century, a near contemporary of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln\" title=\"\">Abraham Lincoln</a>, a better man with a better legacy (and much better jokes).</p> <p>Unlike the gentle 16th US president (1861-65) the highly aggressive Bismarck was far from a reluctant war-maker. In power from 1862 to 1890 he engineered three short wars – they’re where the word “blitzkrieg” comes from – against Denmark (1863), Austria (1866) and France (1870) to turn Prussia into the <a href=\"http://ibatpv.org/projects/germany/2ndreich/index.html\" title=\"\">Second Reich</a> (1871-1918) – the first had been medieval – and fatally undermined Germany’s fragile liberal institutions at a critical stage of their evolution.</p> <p>What Germans got instead was a militarised monarchical autocracy sustained by rampant nationalism and supported by intellectuals of all kinds – sociologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber\" title=\"\">Max Weber</a> later repented his enthusiasm – who should have known better. Parliament was marginalised, the parties manipulated against each other, and Bismarck threatened to resign whenever he was seriously challenged. It was outrageous and it ended in the ruins of Berlin of 1945.</p> <p>Yes, Bismarck spent the last 20 years of his career protecting the peace in Europe before the idiot new Kaiser, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor\" title=\"\">Wilhelm II</a>, sacked him (Punch’s cartoonist famously portrayed it as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropping_the_Pilot\" title=\"\">“Dropping the Pilot”</a>). But the damage was done. Bismarck had built a racing car only he could drive.</p> <p>This kind of behaviour always matters because there are usually talented politicians around who see military adventurism and democratic corner-cutting as a tempting path to domestic ascendancy and wider prestige. Vladimir Putin seems to be ticking some boxes – witness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/30/kremlin-critic-navalny-given-suspended-sentence-brother-jailed\" title=\"\">this week’s intimidatory conviction of a promising opponent</a> – but there are others in sight. Close to home Turkey’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan\" title=\"\">Recep Erdoğan</a> strikes me as a clever man with a dangerous lack of scruple. And, before anyone mentions Margaret Thatcher, she was usually rather cautious and sensitive to parliament, more so than Tony Blair was, I am sorry to say.</p> <p>After its humiliations at the hands of Napoleon, 19th century Prussia’s was – even more than under Frederick the Great – a conscious process of self-aggrandisement. Plenty resisted the trend and Bismarck’s “iron and blood” exposition of his realpolitik ambitions in 1862 nearly got him fired before he started. He was not charismatic, soft-spoken, even hesitant, but utterly dominant over his king and even the powerful military, which privately mocked his weakness for uniforms. Try <a href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/paul-lay/interview-jonathan-steinberg\" title=\"\">this interview</a> with his biographer Jonathan Steinberg for a flavour of him. “This man means what he says,” Benjamin Disraeli concluded. Scary.</p> <p>Roman history was again in vogue in Germany when in 1871, Bismarck’s patsy, Wilhelm I, king of victorious Prussia against Napoleon III, copied the Russian tsars and got an upgrade to Caesar – the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser\" title=\"\">new German Kaiser</a> – proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors at occupied Versailles. Less than 50 years later the defeated Germans were back in Versailles to accept an unjust, dictated peace in 1918, itself overthrown with a vengeance by Hitler in 1940.</p> <p>Thank goodness the good Germans, the Germans of Beethoven and Schiller, have been back in charge since 1945, the kind of high-minded moderate people who were sidelined in the Bismarck era after the failed bourgeois revolution of 1848. They make their share of mistakes – the eurozone’s economic policies are largely shaped in Berlin – but they are not to be equated with the dreadful legacy of Kaiser Bill, let alone of Adolf Hitler, despite what unimaginative Eurosceptics say after reading the Daily Express.</p> <p>Why does Bismarck escape blame as the chief architect of 20th-century Germany – and thus the man who created a militarised political machine that only he could handle? He used to get plenty of blame, but historical memory does funny things and the enormity of Hitler’s regime (he was “Vienna’s revenge on Berlin” wrote AJP Taylor) seems to have blotted out the significant past. When I ask Germans now they sometimes say: “Well, Bismarck is remembered mostly for the social security system he set up,” one designed to neutralise the appeal of socialism, still recognisable and admired today.</p> <p>We can follow that line of argument. Bismarck’s Reich pioneered the modern welfare state, copied by others, including progressive British Liberals such as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill between 1906 and the outbreak of war. Much criticism can be made of both of them over long careers, but neither was a militarist or would-be autocrat, bent on destroying accountable government.</p> <p>Churchill was quite soppy about parliament. At a perilous moment in 1917 he told a fellow Liberal MP in the darkened Commons that “this little room is the shrine of the world’s liberties”, one that would decide the outcome of the war. “It is for the virtue of this that we shall muddle through to success and for lack of this Germany’s brilliant efficiency leads her to final destruction.” If we throw in a little help from the US and the British empire he was right about that – twice. You can imagine Abraham Lincoln saying it – but never Bismarck.</p> <p>In any case there is a sense in which the first world war was indeed over by Christmas 1914, only Bismarck’s autocratic heirs couldn’t accept it. Unlike in 1870 and again in 1940 the Germans had failed to take Paris in another lightning war that summer. At great cost in lives the armies of the despised French Third Republic – shovelling troops up from the capital in buses and taxis – and Britain’s “contemptible little army” (Kaiser Bill’s phrase) held the line at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_the_Marne\" title=\"\">first battle of the Marne</a>, just 30 miles north-east of Paris.</p> <p>It had been a close thing, but on 11 September <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Younger\" title=\"\">Helmuth von Moltke</a>, German commander and nephew of the victor of 1870, ordered a retreat to the river Aisne, lines that would be “fortified and defended”, he ordered – in other words trenches.

Despite her diagnosis of cancer the same year, Cathy continued working on the tapestry, which involved 30 separate panels created by 200 adult volunteers and 60 schoolchildren, until its completion in October 2013. The tapestry continues to be displayed at various venues throughout Ireland.</p> <p>Cathy was born in London, the daughter of Peter Henderson, a lecturer in occupational psychology, and his wife, Mary (nee Topham), an artist. She grew up in Staffordshire, Belfast and Bangor before spending a year in Paris. Instead of taking up a place at the École des Beaux-Arts, she went to Dublin to study at the NCAD. She graduated in 1993 after a summer at the studio of the graphic designer Milton Glaser in Manhattan.</p> <p>In 1996 Cathy worked at the Lyric theatre, Belfast, producing a large series of paintings documenting the actors and crew. In 1998 she and her husband, David Gregg, produced an audio documentary on the Lisdoonvarna matchmaking festival in Co Clare, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and nominated for a Sony award.</p> <p>In 2002 Cathy was involved in a serious road accident. Many months in hospital followed, with numerous operations to reconstruct a shattered leg. During that time she noticed portraits of various hospital luminaries along the corridors, but recognised none of them. She decided to redress the balance with a series of paintings of the hospital workers she saw every day, which were exhibited at St James’s hospital, Dublin in 2009.</p> <p>Cathy extended this concept and painted a series of portraits of Dublin city council’s cleansing department workers, exhibited as Below the Surface, at the Mermaid arts centre, Bray, Co Wicklow, in 2007. Both these exhibitions included audio recordings, engineered by her husband, of the subjects talking about their work.</p> <p>Despite her disability Cathy travelled several times to the Canadian Arctic, working and exhibiting with Inuit artists. Her career included community art projects in that region as well as in Belfast, Dublin and New York. She also taught art in Irish prisons. Her work is in private and public collections, including the National Bank of Canada and Queen’s University Belfast.</p> <p>She is survived by David, me, my brother Michael, and our father. Our mother and brother Andrew predeceased her.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9894942","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2211560","internalRevision":"13","publication":"The

Photograph: Xie Haining/Xinhua Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The United Nations confronts war, famine, disease, climate change and much else, but perhaps the greatest and most persistent challenge the organisation has faced is the tendency of its member states to deny it the leadership its work requires. The issue is back, as it is every decade, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/07/un-secretary-general-election-2016-haphazard-lottery\" title=\"\">the selection of a new secretary general</a> to take over in 2016.</p> <p>The UN enshrined the idea of harnessing the talents of a group of men and women from around the world, accountable to governments but working exclusively for the global good. It has only sometimes, and quite by accident, been fulfilled. When there is sufficient leadership to give life to it, the arts of peace flourish and the global discourse is enriched. When there is not, a price is paid in blood.</p> <p>This deserves more attention. Consider, for example, the British Foreign Office. After 1918, its diplomats made eloquent arguments for the need for an international service. But such arguments are now little understood. Worse, David Cameron is currently putting forward <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/30/labour-andrew-lansley-un-job-humanitarian\" title=\"\">his failed health secretary Andrew Lansley as the UN undersecretary for humanitarian affairs</a>. Mr Lansley’s interest in the subject is new and his talent is something Mr Cameron is happy without. Amid so many humanitarian emergencies, it would be callous of Mr Cameron to pursue this nomination and pusillanimous of the secretary general to accept it.</p> <p>The field of those seeking to be the next secretary general is widely felt to be underwhelming. Helen Clark, the head of the UN Development Programme, gave an example of how a UN official should not behave when, before the current secretary general was even halfway through his term, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/27/will-helen-clark-be-first-woman-to-run-united-nations\" title=\"\">she began to discuss, in these pages</a>, her interest in succeeding him. It is time for something more serious. A small search committee should be established, led by Kofi Annan, with representatives of the permanent members of the security council, other regions, and a professional headhunter, and it should work through most of next year. The idea that candidates should be limited to one region is unfounded and can be dispensed with. The council should recommend more than one candidate to the general assembly, which should make an appointment for a single term of seven years.</p> <p>It is also time for “We the peoples”, as <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/preamble.shtml\" title=\"\">the UN charter begins</a>, to claim a veto on mediocrity. The new campaign “<a href=\"http://www.1for7billion.org/\" title=\"\">1 for 7 billion</a>” allows people to lend their support in a moment. “Everything will be all right,” <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/18/in-praise-of-dag-hammarskjold\" title=\"\">said Dag Hammarskjöld</a>, “when people, just people, stop thinking of the United Nations as a weird Picasso abstraction and see it as a drawing they made themselves.” A century after absolute sovereignty was so thoroughly discredited, nationalists everywhere are full of passionate intensity, while those who see nationalism as a force for harm often give the impression of lacking all conviction. But nationalists are yesterday’s men. It is just that too much international cooperation has been too technocratic, too deracinated, tending to provoke reaction not partnership.

Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><strong> <br /></strong></p> <p>The number of people with a mental health condition admitted to hospital as an emergency is likely to reach its highest level ever this winter, a former health minister has warned.</p> <p>An estimated 280,000 mental health patients will be admitted to hospital as an emergency in the last three months of 2014, latest analysis suggests as emergency doctors warned that overstretched A&amp;E departments are the wrong place for people in mental distress.</p> <p>The government stopped publishing data on mental health treatment in A&amp;E centres in 2012 but to estimate the scale of the problem Paul Burstow, who was a Liberal Democrat health minister until September 2012, requested a decade of figures from ministers which were then analysed by the consultancy firm Incisive Health. The analysis concluded that if the 10-year trend continued numbers treated for mental health conditions in A&amp;E would have rocketed from 330,000 in 2002 to more than a million in 2014 for the first time.</p> <p>The statistical projections are backed up by emergency doctors who say they are treating increasing numbers of people in mental health crisis. Charities have warned that people with mental health conditions are using A&amp;E to get treatment because they are “being let down by the rest of the system”. While mental illness accounts for 23% of the total impact of ill health in this country, it gets only 13% of the NHS budget.</p> <p>Burstow claimed it was the result of “societal issues tumbling into emergency wards”. Alcoholics are finding themselves at the doorstep of A&amp;E wards while the number of children being admitted to hospital in England for self-harm is at a five-year high.</p> <p>Bill Morgan, a founding partner of Incisive Health and a former adviser to the ex-health secretary Andrew Lansley, said: “With no signs that the financial pressure on the mental health sector will abate, these findings will be a wake-up call to NHS leaders over the Christmas and New Year break. If mental health emergencies continue to rise in this way, then there will be precious little capacity to meet the government’s mental health waiting time targets.”</p> <p>Mark Winstanley, chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness said: “The fact that so many people with mental health problems are going to A&amp;E for support shows how badly they are being let down by the system. Too often, going to A&amp;E is the only way people can get any care at all, because mental health services are desperately underfunded and overstretched. Putting in place more specialist mental health services in A&amp;E would be welcome, but it won’t come close to tackling these problems. What we really need to see is money redistributed from acute care, to transform the entire mental health system – so that everyone can get good care for their mental and physical health, no matter where they are or what their circumstances.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the College of Emergency Medicine said that mental illness patients “are an increasing part of the A&amp;E workload”. He said a report released in November by the college into people brought to emergency departments who had been sectioned under the mental health act found “many reports of concerns of care for these vulnerable (patients)”.</p> <p>“We understand that police cells are a poor place for these people, but so also is a busy emergency department, particularly if the patient has no physical health problems. An emergency department can be a frightening and disorientating place for a person suffering a crisis”.</p> <p>Anne Hicks, the college’s mental health lead and a A&amp;E consultant in Plymouth , said: “The reason that people end up at A&amp;E is that we are big and we are open. People know there’s a single number to call to get an ambulance out and that is important when you are at home and dealing with a mental health crisis.</p> <p>“The trouble is that not all emergency departments will have the right people to deal with what might be very complex patients and histories. But trying to get help before going to A&amp;E is very difficult. In my own hospital we have three clinical commissioning groups, across two counties and different telephone help lines for adults and children. I am a specialist and I get confused trying to work out how to get help never mind someone suffering from a mental illness.”</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesperson said: “We know the NHS is busier than ever before, which is why we’ve given the NHS a record £700m this winter for more doctors, nurses and beds to support both physical and mental health care. The NHS has ensured there are plans in every area to manage the extra demand.</p> <p>“The benefits to mental health services from this money include more funding for liaison psychiatry in A&amp;E departments, more support for people who have self-harmed and extra help for mental health crisis teams.”</p> <p>• The headline on this article was amended on 1 January 2015 to better reflect the facts of the story.<br /></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934463","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216846","internalRevision":"39","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Former health minister Paul Burstow says if trend continues, numbers treated for mental health issues in A&amp;E could soar to more than a million this winter<br>","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Mental health patient admissions to A&E set to reach record levels","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Randeep Ramesh, social affairs editor","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-01-01T08:00:04Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420055792991/Accident-and-Emergency-Un-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gpb","wordcount":"858","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420055792991/Accident-and-Emergency-Un-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a45014e4b048dfa4053b46","newspaperPageNumber":"13","internalStoryPackageCode":"84475","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-04T08:00:04Z","standfirst":"<p>Former health minister Paul Burstow says if trend continues, numbers treated for mental health issues in A&amp;E could soar to more than a million this winter<br></p>","linkText":"Mental health patient admissions to A&E set to reach record levels","creationDate":"2014-12-31T19:35:48Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T13:58:18Z","internalContentCode":"454079879"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/01/mental-health-emergency-highest-winter-burstow","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/jan/01/mental-health-emergency-highest-winter-burstow","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"a030dcc11187a669138bac44f9d31621b8ab553c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420055797976/Accident-and-Emergency-Un-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*48714676","suppliersReference":"E7HA2W","altText":"Accident and Emergency Unit sign ","caption":"Charities warn that people with mental health conditions are using A&amp;E because they are ‘being let down by the rest of the system’.

Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Investment in magistrates’ training has fallen sharply and the lack of support is in danger of devaluing their role in the criminal justice system, according to a report on the future of the unpaid judiciary.</p> <p>The findings come as recruitment to the magistracy has effectively been frozen in many areas, while the number of JPs in England and Wales has declined from about 30,000 to 20,000. Closures of local courts due to austerity measures, reductions in reported crime and an increase in the number of full-time district judges – formerly known as stipendiary magistrates – have all contributed to the fall.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://transformjustice.org.uk/?page_id=10\">report by the charity Transform Justice</a> says spending by the judicial college on magistrates’ training has declined from £110 per magistrate in 2008-09 to £26 in 2013-14.</p> <p>By contrast, according to the study by Penelope Gibbs, a former magistrate who is the director of Transform Justice, as much as £629 per person was spent on training district judges last year. Additional funding is provided by local court officials and the Magistrates’ Association.</p> <p>“Since responsibility for magistrates’ training was delegated to the judiciary in 2005,” the report concludes, “there has been no major independent review of its quality and whether it meets the needs of today’s courts.”</p> <p>“Magistrates’ training, like recruitment, has suffered badly from government cuts and from the government batting reform into the long grass,” said Gibbs. “JPs have been waiting four months already for the government to publish their green paper on the future of the magistracy. Unfortunately, this delay reinforces magistrates’ impression that they are seen as low priority.”</p> <p>Magistrates are not paid and are alone among judges in being subject to regular appraisal of their competence. Most district judges, who earn about £104,000 a year, are appraised but the checks are not compulsory.</p> <p>The Magistrates’ Association has been lobbying for its members to have increased sentencing powers, allowing to them to give offenders up to 12 months in custody – a move resisted so far by the MoJ.</p> <p>One magistrate interviewed for the report said: “As someone who has been involved in education all her life, I am truly shocked by the lack of professional training in what should be a professional role … I believe constructive and worthwhile training to be essential for the bench to keep up to date with not only developments in law, but in changing society too.”</p> <p>A magistrate who has served 25 years on the bench but did not want to be identified told the Guardian: “Training has gone down over the last few years because of government cutbacks. You have to keep up with changes in the law and other changes in society.</p> <p>“The essential training is compulsory but there’s not an awful lot of additional training any more. If you sentence someone to a community order or to prison, you would have greater confidence in doing so if you knew what it involves but the cutbacks have made it a lot more difficult.”</p> <p>The Magistrates’ Association, he added, was considering introducing continuous professional development “to ensure that magistrates are up to the mark”.</p> <p>Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, said: “We would like to have a more diverse magistracy, but we haven’t recruited over the last 10 years.</p> <p>“Three magistrates sitting together are significantly less expensive than one district judge. We all work to the same guidelines and same proceedings. We would like to see more training and would like to make our appraisal system more robust.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the judiciary said: “Magistrates are still being trained to a high standard. Savings have been made to training costs through measures such as no longer using external venues, increased utilisation of technology, and more focused and flexible training.</p> <p>“There is no plan to reduce the number of magistrates. While numbers have fallen naturally due to reduced workloads, recruitment continues and there are still over 20,000 magistrates compared to just 150 district judges [magistrates courts].</p> <p>“The need to recruit magistrates and district judges [magistrates courts] is reviewed annually as a whole. One of the key aims is to ensure optimal use of both magistrates and district judges, each being essential to the administration of justice.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9895239","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216823","internalRevision":"15","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Charity says the role of magistrates in the criminal justice system is in danger of being devalued","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Magistrates’ role at risk from reduced investment in training, report warns","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Owen Bowcott, legal affairs correspondent","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T18:38:23Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420050956005/Magistrates-court-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gzf","wordcount":"706","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420050956005/Magistrates-court-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a4402ee4b06182e1ed8b1a","newspaperPageNumber":"17","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T18:38:23Z","standfirst":"Charity says the role of magistrates in the criminal justice system is in danger of being devalued","linkText":"Magistrates’ role at risk from reduced investment in training, report warns","creationDate":"2014-12-31T18:27:58Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T12:49:41Z","internalContentCode":"454077363"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/31/magistrates-reduced-investment-in-training","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/law/2014/dec/31/magistrates-reduced-investment-in-training","sectionName":"Law","elements":[{"id":"ca359a55cb2f23b677283b69f06c90cf20877df4","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420050962458/Magistrates-court-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Martin Godwin","picdarUrn":"GD*46877259","suppliersReference":".","altText":"Magistrates court","caption":"Recruitment to the magistracy has effectively been frozen in many areas.

Or so I thought, looking at Facebook, where there were an intriguing number of people openly stating their resolutions. Then I went back and checked properly and could only find three real resolutions. Plus one more who had said: “My new year’s resolution is to be a bigger idiot. So far it’s going well.”</p> <p>Looking over the excellent intentions listed, they were all things people were absolutely never going to do or almost certainly going to do anyway. “Write a novel.” “Self-publish an ebook.” “Send out a newsletter in the first week of the year.” Wow, these writerly types really know how to live.</p> <p>This is the problem with resolutions, and the reason that most people have given up on them. They’re either things that are more or less definitely going to happen, with or without a resolution. Or they’re wishlist craziness. This is why most people don’t make resolutions any more. They know they’re a self-deceiving con.</p> <p>The truth is that the success of a resolution is really about habit, and there is not much point in “resolving” to change a habit. You have to know how to physically change it. And that’s where we all struggle. Because we are creatures of (bad) habit. In a new book coming out in March, <a href=\"http://www.tworoadsbooks.com/non-fiction/better-than-before-gretchen-rubin/\" title=\"\">Better Than Before (Two Roads)</a>, Gretchen Rubin, author of a series of bestselling books on happiness, contends that our habits have the capacity to lengthen or shorten our lives. And what we do every day matters more than what we do occasionally. Why is it, she asks, that all of us can (just about) manage to brush our teeth every day without even questioning it, but many of us struggle to establish exercise routines that stick?</p> <p>The answer to this is, of course, association: most people can’t go to sleep without brushing their teeth, and they structure their teeth-brushing around bedtime. They don’t have to think about brushing their teeth or use willpower (a painful and finite resource) or even remember why it’s important. They just do it. If you can find an exercise routine that feels to you like brushing your teeth, you win. Rubin suggests doing balancing exercises while brushing your teeth but personally, I think that’s weird. But I don’t have a regular exercise routine so don’t listen to me.</p> <p>Her thesis is fascinating, persuasive and, in some ways, not an easy sell. After testing habit-changing methods on herself and on others and digesting all the studies, she claims that the business of habit formation is intensely, almost painfully, personal. It’s impossible for anyone to advise you on what’s best: you need to work out what will work for you and you alone.</p> <p>What is a natural habit for one person (getting up early and going jogging) – so much so that they don’t even see it as a habit, it’s just something they like to do – will be virtually impossible in another, no matter how much willpower they employ. The key to changing your habits and establishing new ones is first to understand who you are and why you do the things you do. No big deal, then. Just the work of a lifetime.</p> <p>While we all try to master that, let’s look at some habit-changing suggestions for others. Because improving the bad habits of others is so much easier than changing your own. How can Russell Brand be better than before? Sack the chest-hair attendant and get some buttons for your shirts instead. (Rubin calls this “Clean Slate”.) Kim Kardashian? Buy some really big pants and keep them on whenever you’re not in a private place. (“First Steps”.) Nigel Farage? Ditch the beer and the pies and replace them with the things we all know you really want, and which you surely consume when the cameras are not there: a white wine spritzer and some pistachios. (“Reward”.) The bad habit I suspect I’m not changing? Buying and reading books about habit formation and altering nothing at all.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9933611","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216446","internalRevision":"25","publication":"The

This is the 13th cut in prices by the supermarket since the end of September and in total it takes 19p a litre off petrol and 15p a litre off diesel. For Morrisons, it is the sixth cut since the beginning of December.</p> <p>The AA motoring organisation said these moves would have a positive impact on the wider economy although it cautioned against predicting further falls.</p> <p>“The UK average price for petrol is currently around 113p per litre and these welcome decisions on making further price cuts will eventually filter down in some form to other retailers,” it said in a statement.</p> <p>“So the UK average price will fall further as we enter 2015. However, just how far it falls is anyone’s bet. Current indications are that the magical £1-per-litre average price across the UK is still looking unlikely in the short term,” it added.</p> <p>But the damaging flipside of a low oil price was provided by a now besieged North Sea oil and gas industry, which said the price slump was causing major problems. The oil and gas industry supports an estimated 450,000 jobs in the UK and is particularly important to Scotland’s economy.</p> <p>Mike Tholen, economic director at the Oil &amp; Gas UK lobby group, told the BBC: “We are already seeing, even at $60 a barrel, that about 10% of our production could be at risk if we see low prices continue.</p> <p>“Inevitably there will be downward pressure on employment. I’m afraid people will lose their jobs at low prices – that is a tragedy and I will be working very closely with the government to try and mitigate.”</p> <p>Shell, BP and other oil companies have already started to cut jobs. In the US one of the first projects to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the rest of the world has been put on hold.</p> <p>Excelerate Energy, which also operates a gas plant in the north-east of England, has postponed a scheme to build a floating export terminal at Lavaca Bay, Texas – at least until April. There are now fears that a host of other LNG export facilities, designed to ship US shale gas abroad including to the UK, will also be shelved.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935063","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216706","internalRevision":"37","publication":"The

Each of the patients taking part in the study had a GRN mutation. The aim was to recreate damaged neurons in the laboratory.</p> <p>But the researchers found that iPSCs derived from the patients’ were unable to generate cortical neurons, the cell type most affected by FTD. Cortical neurons are the cells responsible for most of the brain’s complex higher activity enabling thought, perception and voluntary movement.</p> <p>The findings, reported in the journal Stem Cell Reports, indicated that defective GRN altered the Wnt signalling pathway, which plays an important role in neuronal development.</p> <p>Inhibiting Wnt either with genetic correction or a drug compound restored the ability of the stem cells to convert into cortical neurons.</p> <p>Co-author Dr Catherine Verfaillie, from the University of Leuven in Belgium, said: “IPSC models can now be used to better understand dementia, and in particular frontotemporal dementia, and might lead to the development of drugs that can curtail or slow down the degeneration of cortical neurons.”</p> <p>In their paper, the scientists suggested that the underlying causes of dementia “may often already be present earlier during life”.</p> <p>They add: “Signalling events required for neurodevelopment may also play major roles in neurodegeneration and … targeting such pathways – as for instance, the WNT pathway presented in this study – may result in the creation of novel therapeutic approaches for FTD.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936302","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216796","internalRevision":"15","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Defective cells grown in dish reveal pathway linked to inherited form of dementia","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Stem cell study leads to potential new dementia treatment","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Press Association","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T18:13:06Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420049517498/Stem-cells-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gnf","wordcount":"461","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420049517498/Stem-cells-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a433bbe4b084424a7b2e9b","internalStoryPackageCode":"83647","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T18:13:06Z","standfirst":"Defective cells grown in dish reveal pathway linked to inherited form of dementia","linkText":"Stem cell study leads to potential new dementia treatment","creationDate":"2014-12-31T17:34:51Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T11:29:31Z","internalContentCode":"454075829"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/31/stem-cell-study-dementia-treatment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2014/dec/31/stem-cell-study-dementia-treatment","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"14aa872534ce649667b8fa29cfe7cb84e3754512","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420049522905/Stem-cells-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*37553502","suppliersReference":"C6F9D1","altText":"Stem cells","caption":"The research involved creating human cells in a laboratory dish instead of relying on tests on mice.

Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>A few months ago, diversity campaigner Simon Albury visited the Today programme and was shocked to find a very white, male, middle-class production team running things. The only person of colour there was the bloke asking if he wanted coffee or tea. But why did this matter? It mattered because what Simon realised and exposed that day was that the news in Britain comes from one perspective. A perspective that is almost exclusively white, and predominantly male.</p> <p>So Tuesday morning’s show was a big deal for me. I was guest editor – yes Lenny Henry, the man who used to say <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PxekZnVM0M\" title=\"\">“Katanga my friends”</a> – in charge of curating the entire show. In short, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/30/lenny-henry-today-programme-radio-4-review\" title=\"\">I had a unique opportunity</a> to explore what the news agenda would look like if it came from a more diverse perspective. Coupled with this, the Beeb pulled out all the stops to make the production team the most diasporic/diverse/multiracial team they’ve ever had. I contributed pieces on young people playing jazz; the new approach to diversity in comics produced by DC, Marvel and others; Ukip; culture secretary Sajid Javid; and also a feature called “Firsts”, about some of the diverse, diasporic pioneers in the television and film industry.</p> <p>I was very nervous. I knew that the listening public can judge the guest-editing of their flagship news programme harshly. On Tuesday, Twitter was ablaze with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/30/lenny-henry-guest-editing-radio-4-today-twitter-bbc\" title=\"\">criticisms of my tenure and choice of subject matter</a>. There was a lot of “Len’s a racist”, “Len’s got a chip on his shoulder”, too. One stood out: “The sooner Lenny Henry gets Ebola the better.” I could have taken it personally, but what this reaction told me was just how unusual a diverse perspective on the news – that doesn’t come from the typical white, middle-class man – can be, and what a shock to the system it is.</p> <p>The irony is that I don’t mind being criticised for editing the Today programme. The fact is, I’m a comedian. I shouldn’t be editing the Today programme. I don’t have the necessary skills, judgment and insight required to do a fantastic job. But the other fact is that there are many other black and Asian people with those necessary skills who are simply not getting the breaks.</p> <p>Black people, Asians and minority ethnics make up 14.3% of the UK’s population. London is 40% Bame. Yet employment of Bame in the creative industries has fallen to 5.4% – the lowest it’s ever been. Since 2009, about 2,000 Bame people have left the industry. In this same period, employment has grown by 4,000. That means, statistically, for every black and Asian that has left the industry, two white people have been given employment.</p> <p>So how do we make sure that a Bame person editing the Today programme, or any other news programme for that matter, is not a special event? How do we make sure that the other 364 days of news do not consistently come from a white, middle-class, male perspective?</p> <p>Whenever I have these conversations about “how”, someone from a non-diverse background starts talking about avoiding quotas and box-ticking, and emphasising the importance of employing people on their merits. They often play to my ego. They say “Lenny, you were talented and that’s why you made it. Why should someone that’s not talented get the gig just because of the colour of their skin or gender?” As I said in my Bafta speech in March, and have repeatedly said since, I believe the solution – the “how” – is indeed all about employing people on their merits. What I find frustrating is the complete absence of opportunity in some fields.</p> <p>Whereas I have only dipped my toe into news, I know much more about another part of the creative industries – acting. And here in the UK, work has simply dried up for Bame actors. People such as David Oyelowo, Idris Elba, Thandie Newton, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Cush Jumbo aren’t getting the offers one might expect. Colour-blind casting hasn’t quite caught on in the UK, so jobs in high-end drama are dribbling away. It’s all about supply and demand: until those in charge of deciding who gets to make what programme when and with whom come from a Bame background, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/22/lenny-henry-broadcasters-employ-more-black-asian-people\" title=\"\">we won’t get a Bame Pride and Prejudice or Middlemarch any time soon</a>.</p> <p>Having spoken to several Bame friends working in UK news and current affairs, I can tell you that the frustrations of actors are no exception. My experience on the Today programme, and the audience’s reaction to it, proved it. However, the minute a decision-maker chooses to open staffing up – says “Maybe we should have this cool Muslim director/London-Ghanaian writer/eastern European production designer” – suddenly the idea of creating an atmosphere where more than the establishment point of view prevails becomes attractive, which is why inclusivity for all comers is the future.</p> <p>Imagine if there was a ethnically diverse group of executives or LGBT or disabled staff. It would certainly undo some of the damage done in the past three years. The solution I continue to believe will work is for all the broadcasters to ringfence money for Bame productions. These could be made by independent companies or a production team within a larger organisation, such as the Today team at the BBC.</p> <p>The Today programme’s subject matter and crewing of Tuesday morning’s show were groundbreaking – there were Bame participants from all walks of life and, apart from the usual news, sport and weather, several items handpicked by me about things that I believe Bame people are concerned about at the moment – Ukip, the death of real music, diversity in comics, to name a few.</p> <p>The final interview, where I was interrogated about my views on diversity, was combative to say the least; I felt as though I was being called to account for spoiling everyone’s Christmas. The fact that my interrogators – Nkem Ifejika and Mishal Husain – were of African and Pakistani origins was a minor triumph in itself, proving the strength of their journalistic integrity.</p> <p>Overall I enjoyed guest-editing the programme and would do it again. But I would much rather that, instead of one special day, Radio 4 listeners had the opportunity to hear and understand my perspective, through the capable and talented hands of a Bame crew like the one I worked with on Tuesday, for the rest of the year. And I believe that will only happen if the BBC and others adopt the Henry plan. Let’s hope someone out there really was listening.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935947","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216783","internalRevision":"25","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Lenny Henry:</strong> British news is dominated by a white, male perspective.

Most walkers are focused on getting to the top, but for those who take things more slowly the rocks around them tell the tale of how this mountain formed.</p> <p>Around two-thirds of the way up there is sharp change, from red granite to dark grey andesite – a lava that erupted when the mountain was an active volcano hundreds of millions of years ago. Andesite is never normally found next to granite – a rock that forms slowly deep inside a magma chamber – and the traditional explanation for this unusual juxtaposition is that it was caused by a spectacular collapse 400m years ago, when the roof of the magma chamber failed, and the top of the volcano fell in.</p> <p>But now geologists are not so sure. Last summer<a href=\"http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/December_January-2014/Mapping-the-Ben\" title=\"\"> a team of climbers, geologists and botanists investigated previously unexplored nooks and crannies</a> on the steep and forbidding and sheer 600-metre north face of Ben Nevis.</p> <p>Dangling from ropes the scientists used state-of-the-art digital technology to photograph the rock and measure its orientation.</p> <p>The extra detail suggests that the story of the mountain’s formation might be more complex, and perhaps it wasn’t the lava that crashed down, but instead the granite that rose up.</p> <p>Over the next two summers the team will be going back to take more measurements to resolve the question. In the meantime a film of their adventures will be shown in February at the <a href=\"http://www.mountainfestival.co.uk\" title=\"\">Fort William mountain festival</a>. <strong>Kate Ravilious</strong></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934558","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216756","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Kate Ravilious:</strong> The sharp change in colour two-thirds of the way up tells the tale of how Britain’s tallest mountain was formed","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Terrawatch: Taking a closer look at Ben Nevis","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Kate Ravilious","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T21:30:02Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420042234261/Ben-Nevis-panoramic-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gm2","wordcount":"266","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420042234261/Ben-Nevis-panoramic-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a41d85e4b084424a7b2e8e","newspaperPageNumber":"34","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T21:30:02Z","linkText":"Terrawatch: Taking a closer look at Ben Nevis","creationDate":"2014-12-31T16:00:05Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T08:51:58Z","internalContentCode":"454073514"},"webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/dec/31/terrawatch-a-closer-look-at-ben-nevis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2014/dec/31/terrawatch-a-closer-look-at-ben-nevis","sectionName":"Science","elements":[{"id":"b1af808e210b74f0aae720d8a1b042f170a5ea30","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420042240697/Ben-Nevis-panoramic-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Flickr Vision","picdarUrn":"GD*49141917","suppliersReference":"Ben_Nevis_panoramic.jpg","altText":"Ben Nevis panoramic","caption":"The formation of Ben Nevis may be more complex than geologists previously thought.

Hospital A&E units have now missed the 95% target every week for well over a year. Photograph: Mike Goldwater/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>If the NHS’s recent performance underwent one of the service’s own health checks, the readings would have the doctor concerned prescribing urgent medical intervention. Almost every day brings new evidence of an increasingly worrying situation that looks ominously as if it is building slowly and relentlessly into a full-blown crisis.</p> <p>The three legs of the stool that is NHS emergency care – A&amp;E, GPs and ambulance services – are all wobbling dangerously. Emergency departments’ ability to treat the required 95% of patients within four hours has declined sharply in recent weeks, with just 84.7% treated within that time – its worst ever level. Hospital-based A&amp;E units have now missed the 95% target every week for well over a year while patients are spending more time on trolleys in corridors than they should or being shuffled from one A&amp;E to another.</p> <p>GP surgeries are wilting under the strain of increasing demand and too few family doctors. The line of people pictured on the front page of the Daily Mail recently as they queued from 6.30am to get an appointment at their local surgery was a microcosm of a widespread problem.</p> <p>Ambulance services are also wobbling. Three of England’s 10 regional ambulance services are, or very recently have been, on a state of “critical” alert. Like their colleagues elsewhere in the NHS, their capacity to respond quickly enough to genuine medical need is fraying at the edges. In March, London ambulance service reached the target 75% of critically ill patients facing a life or death emergency within the maximum eight-minute response time in all 32 boroughs. By June, it did not manage that in any of them. In some boroughs crews reached just 48% of such patients on time.</p> <p>Surveying the NHS’s decline, one minister said privately: “One of the slightly scary things is that no one, including the best brains in the health system, really knows what’s going on. It’s a complex picture and there’s no one factor.”</p> <p>But one last statistic – that admissions to hospital via A&amp;E have also hit a record high – is the most telling of all. In all 159,054 patients were admitted in the first two weeks of December. That underlines a simple fact: that more people are more unwell than ever before.</p> <p>Paradoxically, while Britain’s healthy life expectancy – the time people live free of disease or disability – is lengthening, it has also never seen more illness. The NHS is visibly struggling to respond to a growing burden of illness, especially given that its ringfenced budget has disguised the fall in health’s overall share of GDP under the coalition, just when rising need made that ill-advised. The ageing population is the main reason. More older people mean more broken bones, more dementia, more infections, more failing hearts and lungs, and much else besides. That trend will only continue. And the problem is compounded in the depths of winter, with colds and vomiting outbreaks common.</p> <p>There are other drivers too, none of which involves an easy remedy. Obesity, drinking and smoking are producing an ever-larger toll of lifestyle-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes and drink-related liver damage.</p> <p>Internal faults developing in the NHS are exacerbating the problem. A heavy price is being paid for the lack of health services outside hospitals to keep people healthier for longer at home – billions of pounds of NHS money have gone into this, with little return. Meanwhile heavy cuts to social care services have followed austerity’s deep cuts to local council budgets. Older and frail people not properly supported at home are more likely to come to grief, end up in hospital and probably need to stay there. When they get to hospital it becomes harder to discharge them without social care to look after them at home.</p> <p>People suffering mental health problems are also adding to the pressures on GPs and A&amp;E units because support is not available in the community, as we report.</p> <p>Meanwhile there is a recruitment crisis in the NHS. Older GPs are retiring early to avoid burnout and too few newly qualified doctors are opting to join general practice. The result is long waits for appointments – meaning patients increasingly use A&amp;E as their first, rather than last, port of call. More and more hospitals are pleading with patients to seek help elsewhere for less serious problems, but to no avail. Attendances keep rising. London ambulance service also says a shortage of paramedics is one reason why it is so stretched.</p> <p>So there is more demand, which means more pressure on increasingly stretched resources and the NHS is in trouble as a result. While we can identify the factors at play no one definitively knows what lies behind the relentless demand for care – or the best way to fix it. Both practically, for patients and NHS staff, and politically in the runup to the general election, this could not be more pressing. As things stand, 2015 will be a very bumpy ride for the country’s most cherished institution.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936354","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216850","internalRevision":"6","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Britons’ life expectancy is lengthening, but A&amp;E, GPs and ambulance services are struggling to respond to growing burden of illness","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"NHS emergency care on wobbly legs","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Denis Campbell, health correspondent","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-01-01T08:00:04Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420055457062/Ambulance-crew-bring-a-ne-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gpf","wordcount":"853","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420055457062/Ambulance-crew-bring-a-ne-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a45283e4b084424a7b2eb6","newspaperPageNumber":"13","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-04T08:00:04Z","standfirst":"Britons’ life expectancy is lengthening, but A&amp;E, GPs and ambulance services are struggling to respond to growing burden of illness","linkText":"NHS emergency care on wobbly legs","creationDate":"2014-12-31T19:46:11Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T08:00:04Z","internalContentCode":"454080049"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/01/nhs-emergency-care-wobbly-legs","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/jan/01/nhs-emergency-care-wobbly-legs","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"8b80207d556943ba9c6c6f499b72dee8512a2953","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420055462500/Ambulance-crew-bring-a-ne-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*49003767","suppliersReference":"BG9NC6","altText":"Ambulance crew bring a new patient to an NHS A&E ward","caption":"Ambulance crew bring a new patient to an NHS A&E ward.

Was the disgraced athlete discussing his defence strategy, his deepest fears, his possible fate?</p> <p>“Me and him being bachelors, I tried to talk about women, if there’s any hot media girls, that type of thing,” Van Vuuren recalls, laughing. “Also his knowledge about athletics was still brilliant. He knew about times run yesterday in a competition in America and everything of that sort. So we spoke mainly about athletics.”</p> <p>Sitting at a fish restaurant in one of Pretoria’s roadside strip malls, he can now draw breath and reflect on the televised courtroom epic that dominated 2014 on his sketch pad and on screens around the world.</p> <p>He played a double role, as an athletics coach who has known Pistorius since he was 16 and as the only court artist charged with capturing his tearful, visceral dismantling. The Paralympian, dubbed the “Blade Runner” because of his prosthetic limbs, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/backlash-over-short-sentence-oscar-pistorius-jailed-five-years\">found guilty </a>of culpable homicide for shooting dead his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, and jailed for five years.</p> <p>Van Vuuren, who hopes to sketch him in prison, relays a story he heard from a warden: “The biggest problem now for Oscar is the top brass at correctional services coming into his cell day and night and taking selfies with him. There’s no control and the lower ranks can’t chase them out, so Oscar is annoyed.”</p> <p>Van Vuuren is a former international pole vaulter with a respectable personal best of 5.20 metres. Since 1992 he has been coaching pole vaulters at the University of Pretoria, where his path first crossed with Pistorius. He has been a court artist for four years, covering some of South Africa’s biggest trials, including former police commissioner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/03/jackie-selebi-south-africa-corruption-sentence\">Jackie Selebi’s corruption conviction.</a></p> <p>“I ended up as a sketch artist in court because of an absolute obsession,” said the art teacher’s son. “There was no money. I just had to do it. There was no other way.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3fac118a-a3ad-45db-9ac0-66a7abd75490\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420059837576/517c016d-da42-4af6-98e9-cfb0579e68d7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jaco van Vuuren\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaco van Vuuren on Pistorius: ‘Whoever he is, whatever he did, he is probably a bigger survivor than all of us together, looking at what he went through in his life.’ </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The essentials of a face typically take him two or three minutes, and the full sketch anything from 20 to 45. “It’s always an eerie feeling before the judge does a life sentence.” There have been divorce cases, too: “The body language, they just hate each other, there’s so much emotion going there.”</p> <p>In early February 2013, Van Vuuren had a drink with Pistorius to discuss helping the sprinter’s charity projects for amputees in Africa. On the morning of Valentine’s Day, he was woken by a phone call. “I was in bed, very early, at about a quarter past six and a reporter from [the newspaper] Beeld called me and said, ‘Did you hear what your friend did?’ Being sarcastic I said, what friend where? He said, ‘No, Oscar’s shot his girlfriend’.</p> <p>“On the track that day it was obviously a feeling of disbelief. It was indescribable. He trains there every day and he shot his girlfriend. It’s somebody that we are obviously very proud of because it’s Oscar Pistorius, he’s the biggest name next to Nelson Mandela in South Africa. That’s on the level that he was seen, and all of a sudden this.”</p> <p>The nation remains numb with shock, Van Vuuren believes. “I still think that South Africans can’t cope that well with the idea. It will still take time, even longer than this, because you can’t admire and support a guy in the Olympics the one day, and the next day he’s in an orange jumpsuit. I don’t think people are there yet. I actually heard of a psychologist that wanted to open centres for therapy for people – I think that’s a little bit too far, but that’s how bad it was.”</p> <p>From the start, Pistorius maintained that he had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder when he armed himself, walked down a darkened corridor and fired four lethally expanding bullets through a locked toilet door. The 29-year-old model and law graduate had no means of escape and died almost instantly.</p> <p>Van Vuuren believes the Olympic runner’s version of events, but adds a new, intriguing twist. “The one thing’s that not mentioned in court, and we still don’t know why it’s not been brought up: he was as nervous as hell a week before that happened. He was on the track and I heard this from another Olympian who trained with him. He was as nervous as hell as if something was bound to happen.”</p> <p>Over eight months, the “mega-trial” gripped the public like the murder cases of Victorian England, only now there were the modern trappings of TV cameras, Twitter and book deals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/oscar-pistorius-trial-mirror-south-african-society\">Proceedings veered from opera to soap opera</a>, with a cast that included a black female judge, expert witnesses of sometimes questionable competence, and a social milieu of Pistorius’s neighbours, pals and former girlfriend.</p> <p>The celebrity in the dock repeatedly broke down, wailing and weeping like a child. Van Vuuren, in court to draw it all for broadcasters including CNN, found the spectacle difficult to watch. “You’re first of all a track friend but you’re also a courtroom artist and there’s always the discretion you have to use. It was a draining process from start to finish.</p> <p>“Knowing him very well it was hard emotions and I must honestly admit, from time to time you want to bloody headbutt him, and then a second on you want to hug him and say you got it wrong, let’s work through this.</p> <p>“A lot of times you had to cut off your emotions and say you’re here for a reason.”</p> <p>On one occasion he had to pass the sick bag. “It was tough when they went through the visuals and Oscar started puking,” he recalled. “I was sitting next to him, about two metres away, and then he started puking and what I did was clean out my bag because I knew he was dry heaving. I threw the plastic bag to him; all my Koki pens were thrown out. It was the only bag I could use because I couldn’t get the attention of the court orderlies. I threw the plastic bag over the barrier into the dock, so he used that.”</p> <p>Asked if he tried to sketch Pistorius in the act of vomiting, Van Vuuren replied: “Never. I said this is where I draw the line. Use your discretion and integrity.”</p> <p>Prosecutor Gerrie Nel, dubbed the pitbull, mauled Pistorius and other witnesses during cross-examination and, like a dog with a bone, will appeal against the culpable homicide conviction at the supreme court next year. But Van Vuuren says there is another side to him. “I bumped accidentally into Gerrie Nel a couple of days ago in Exclusive Books [a retail chain]. He’s quite upbeat about the case, although he actually feels sorry for Oscar. Even Gerrie Nel said it can’t be easy for the guy in jail. So he’s got a heart, but this is the law.”</p> <p>Van Vuuren said Pistorius’s aunt called him recently because the 28-year-old wants to start sketching in his prison cell and is seeking tips.</p> <p>“He takes it day by day. We have to know, whoever he is, whatever he did, he is probably a bigger survivor than all of us together, looking at what he went through in his life.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you one thing, Oscar will give anything in his power to change that day, go back and not do it. One day in jail is 10 years too many. South African jail is a hellhole of note. I once went to visit a prison and you don’t want to go there. Lying around there from where he was, my heart goes out to him.”</p> <p>Van Vuuren, who recently turned 44, may never draw a trial on such a scale again. But he has discovered his vocation. He said: “Court is the best place in the whole world for me to be. I see myself as very fortunate to be on that spot where it’s always a make or break for this person. It may be a sombre mood, but the intense emotion in that stillness – I feed from that emotion.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9915725","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216856","internalRevision":"53","publication":"The

It badly damages the atmosphere with the very people with whom they ultimately need to make peace. As we’ve said before, the United States continues to strongly oppose actions – by both parties – that undermine trust and create doubts about their commitment to a negotiated peace. Our position has not changed. Such actions only push the parties further apart.”</p> <p>Acceding to the Rome treaty – the first step in joining the court – had been seen by many as the nuclear option in the recent Palestinian efforts to advance their case for statehood in international forums.</p> <p>“They attack us and our land every day, to whom are we to complain? The security council let us down – where are we to go?” Abbas told a gathering of Palestinian leaders in remarks broadcast on official television.</p> <p>“We want to refer to international institutions, and this is one we are referring to, and we’ll complain to these people,” he added, before signing the documents.</p> <p>Abbas had been under heavy domestic pressure to take action against Israel following months of tension fuelled by the collapse of US-brokered peace talks, a 50-day war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, a spate of deadly Palestinian attacks on Israeli targets and Israeli restrictions on Palestinian access to a key Muslim holy site in Jerusalem. Tuesday’s defeat in the UN security council further raised pressure on Abbas to act. There was a palpable sense of fury in the Palestinian leadership over US and Israeli-led efforts that derailed the UN resolution that called for the ending of the Israeli occupation.</p> <p>The resolution was opposed by the US and Israel and saw both the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, call the president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, on the eve of the vote to persuade him to abstain.</p> <p>“Even half an hour before the vote Nigeria indicated it was committed to voting for the resolution,” one Palestinian source involved in the negotiations commented furiously. “We knew that Rwanda, South Korea and Australia would not back it, but we believed Nigeria was on board.”</p> <p>Britain, Rwanda, Lithuania and South Korea joined Nigeria in abstaining. Welcoming the UN vote, Netanyahu extended his special thanks to Nigeria and Rwanda. “This is what tipped the scales,” he said.</p> <p>Signalling that the vote would not mark an end to the campaign to win a security council resolution, Palestinian and French officials indicated they would continue working to find a text to put to the UN, perhaps within weeks.</p> <p>Before the vote the Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians could return again to the security council, which will have five new members starting on Thursday who are viewed as more sympathetic to their cause.</p> <p>However, despite signalling a sharp defeat to the Arab-supported campaign to get security council backing for a moves towards a Palestinian state, the vote held minimal comfort for Israel, seeing two European countries – France and Luxembourg – support the resolution. The US also made clear it was not voting for the status quo in opposing the resolution.</p> <p>“We voted against this resolution not because we are comfortable with the status quo. We voted against it because … peace must come from hard compromises that occur at the negotiating table,” the US ambassador Samantha Power said.</p> <p>She criticised the decision to bring the draft resolution to a vote as a “staged confrontation that will not bring the parties closer”. She added that the resolution was deeply unbalanced and did not take into account Israel’s security concerns.</p> <p>The ICC can prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed since 1 July 2002, when the Rome statute came into force.</p> <p>According to the ICC’s official website the Rome treaty has been ratified by 122 states.</p> <p>The court can pursue an individual only if crimes were committed on the territory of a state party – one that has signed and ratified the Rome statute – or by a citizen of such a state. Israel has signed but not ratified the treaty.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936097","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216786","internalRevision":"31","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Move will anger Israel and US and paves way for court to take jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Palestinian president signs up to join international criminal court","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Peter Beaumont in Jerusalem","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T17:22:11Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420045944442/Mahmoud-Abbas-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gn5","wordcount":"956","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420045944442/Mahmoud-Abbas-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a42df8e4b048dfa4053b2d","newspaperPageNumber":"1","internalStoryPackageCode":"83625","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T17:22:12Z","standfirst":"Move will anger Israel and US and paves way for court to take jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories","linkText":"Palestinian president signs up to join international criminal court","creationDate":"2014-12-31T17:10:16Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T01:20:07Z","internalContentCode":"454075198"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/palestinian-president-international-criminal-court","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/palestinian-president-international-criminal-court","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"1d970b552f392402231df49d3e79237dcd95af92","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420045950246/Mahmoud-Abbas-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*49066279","suppliersReference":"Nic6399722","altText":"Mahmoud Abbas","caption":"Mahmoud Abbas has signed the Rome statute, the ICC’s founding treaty.

It includes a total of at least 157 rape allegations.</p> <p>Statistics on sexual abuse reports in hospitals were released by 38 out of 45 UK police forces. They document 1,615 attacks that are known about including cases on NHS wards, private clinics and other health centres. But prosecutors have said that up to 90% of sexual abuse goes unreported, suggesting the true figure could be much higher.</p> <p>Last year the Metropolitan police received reports of 17 rapes and 124 other sex abuse crimes inside London hospitals.</p> <p>Most police forces were unable to provide a firm breakdown of the types of hospitals where rapes and sexual abuse had been reported. However, the Met, which accounted for 20% of all reports, said the issue was a particular problem in mental health units, with a significant proportion of alleged victims identified as vulnerable due to mental health problems.</p> <p>Luciana Berger, the shadow minister for public health, said the figures revealed a serious problem for the NHS and called for an urgent review of hospital security.</p> <p>Individual cases of abuse in hospitals have been well documented but this is the first time the scale of the problem has been reported. The figures account for all reports of abuse, although a small number are understood to relate to historic attacks that occurred before 2011.</p> <p>One victim described being groomed by her mental health support officer for five months. When she bumped into him years later it triggered a suicide attempt before she eventually reported him. However, the man resigned before the investigation concluded and authorities were unable to take action against him.</p> <p>“I was in a vulnerable position at the time; certainly not in a position to consent to what he was doing,” she told the Guardian. “What have I gained by coming forward? Nothing. I’m just a person who has made allegations that haven’t been proven.”</p> <p>In another case, a mental health patient described psychiatric hospitals as a “playground for predators”, after she was raped up to 60 times by a member of staff. The woman had been taken to Little Brook hospital in Kent after a breakdown and was warned she would be sectioned if she tried to leave. She described her ordeal to the BBC earlier this year. “At times I was on a very heavy amount of Valium, not to where I was unconscious, but the sedative combined with my already defeated self, I was like putty. He would pull the covers back, do what he had to do and leave, all very quickly. I didn’t move.”</p> <p>When asked whether anyone else at the hospital knew about her abuse, the woman said: “I strongly suspect it can’t have been completely missed. I can’t believe how it could have been so frequent and not picked up on.”</p> <p>She was eventually paid £100,000 compensation, but her attacker avoided jail after receiving a suspended sentence. A third case saw the care assistant Naraindrakoomar Sahodree jailed in 2010 for repeatedly raping a multiple sclerosis sufferer in her bed at a central London hospital. He had managed to get the job despite already being struck off the nurses’ register. In court, his victim said that Sahodree made sure she could not call for help by removing her warning buzzer.</p> <p>Berger said: “A zero-tolerance approach to sexual abuse must be pursued in the NHS. All victims should feel safe to come forward and every incident properly dealt with by the police, courts and health service, to ensure every perpetrator is brought to justice.”</p> <p>Berger said it was particularly worrying that people in mental health units appeared to be at high risk. “These are often some of the most vulnerable patients and their safety must be guaranteed,” she said. “Ministers must order an immediate review of security, with a focus on mental health units.”</p> <p>Nat Miles, senior policy and campaigns officer at Mind, said: “It’s completely unacceptable that sexual abuse is so prevalent within mental health units. Many people told us they are often seen as vulnerable and therefore an easy target by perpetrators, and are more easily discredited and less likely to be taken seriously if they report a crime.” She added: “Too often, crimes on wards are dealt with internally and not reported to police. It’s vital that frontline staff are adequately trained, so crimes are taken seriously, and dealt with quickly and appropriately.”</p> <p>An NHS England spokesperson said: “It is of course essential that both NHS and independent hospitals do everything to ensure that patients are safe and feel safe in their premises, and where concerns arise the police must be able to bring to bear the full force of the law.”</p> <h2><strong>Case study: ‘All i want is an apology’</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sue, a mental health patient, describes the abuse she suffered in an NHS support centre. </strong></p> <p>“He started very subtly, at the time I felt like a genuine relationship. He would walk close to me and say my perfume smelled nice. Then we started holding hands and meeting up out of his working hours. Sometimes I would go and see him when he was working on a Sunday morning and we would go down to the basement together.</p> <p>“I had just been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety and he was my support worker. I was in a vulnerable position at the time; certainly not in a position to consent to what he was doing. It went on over about five months until he abruptly ended it with me one day.</p> <p>“There was sexual touching, there was hands up the clothes. Ever since, I’ve felt that I don’t want another man to touch me again: that’s what he’s left me with.</p> <p>“I knew that what he was doing was inappropriate, but I didn’t realise the effect he was having on me until after we broke up. He was part of the crisis team, so if I felt that I needed support after office hours I knew that if I dialled the number there would be every likelihood that he would be the one answering the phone. I had great difficulty trusting any member of the mental health team at all.</p> <p>“I didn’t dare say anything to anybody. I know it’s not my fault, but I still think it’s my fault. To this day I still partly blame myself.</p> <p>“Earlier this year, I bumped into him in a supermarket. He ignored me. I wasn’t in a good place mentally at the time. Just seeing him triggered extreme distress and anger. I tried to get help, but I couldn’t explain the situation to them. I attempted suicide by the end of the day.</p> <p>“When I eventually reported it, it took 22 weeks for the health authorities to investigate. At the end, there was an independent hearing where he could have his say, but he resigned just beforehand. So what have I gained by coming forward? Nothing. I’m just a person who has made allegations that haven’t been proven.</p> <p>“The police wanted to interview me, but I was in pieces at that point and I couldn’t face a police interview as well as everything else. I think they were hoping that another victim would come forward, because it was just my word against his.</p> <p>“Even when I sent off a statement, I thought: ‘Am I was going to be believed? I’m just a nutty woman and he’s a professional.’, and I have no solid proof that these things happened. When you have a mental disorder you get disbelieved in many shapes and forms, so why should they believe you with this? It’s embarrassing, you feel ashamed, you feel guilty. I was just mortified to have to speak to them about it. They don’t make it easy for people; the whole thing requires a lot of strength.</p> <p>“The whole experience has worsened my mental health; I’ve gone downhill massively. It’s like they’ve come along with a giant spoon, stirred up all the memories and left me to deal with it. I’ve made repeated suicide attempts and I’ve become more and more desperate. At the moment it feels like the lowest point ever in my life.</p> <p>“Until I started talking about it, I didn’t realise how deeply and badly those five months had affected me. To date, I still haven’t had a formal, written comeback about my complaint – not even an apology. That’s all I want; that would make the biggest difference to me.”</p> <p><em>Sue’s name has been changed</em></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935720","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216830","internalRevision":"17","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Records show 50% rise in reports of sexual attacks, with more than 1,600 in past three years","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Sexual violence soars in UK hospitals","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Martin Williams","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T18:54:14Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420051991324/Hospital-corridor-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gzm","wordcount":"1499","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420051991324/Hospital-corridor-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a44382e4b048dfa4053b3e","newspaperPageNumber":"1","internalStoryPackageCode":"83649","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T18:54:15Z","standfirst":"Records show 50% rise in reports of sexual attacks, with more than 1,600 in past three years","linkText":"Sexual violence soars in UK hospitals","creationDate":"2014-12-31T18:42:10Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T01:20:06Z","internalContentCode":"454077917"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/31/sexual-violence-soars-uk-hospitals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2014/dec/31/sexual-violence-soars-uk-hospitals","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"3c2b5c256a7c3d8f432e34ea4eaeeeebfa11b614","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420051997678/Hospital-corridor-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*6201209","altText":"Hospital corridor","caption":"Sexual abuse is a particular problem in mental health units, according to the Met police.

Pink Floyd’s Endless River, the band’s first studio album in 20 years, also made it into the top 10. The only female artist to make it into the chart was the pop-soul singer Paloma Faith, with her album A Perfect Contradiction.</p> <p>This is the 10th year in a row that a British artist has topped the annual UK album bestsellers chart, following on from One Direction in 2013. Commenting on the notably strong year for British music, Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and Brit awards, described the success as remarkable and said the business was postitioned to expand further this year. “Our record labels are backing home-grown talent like Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and George Ezra, who in turn are catching fire around the world.”</p> <p>But the success of individual artists was not enough to compensate for the continued decline in album sales overall, further confirming the predictions of industry pundits and even the head of music at Radio One, George Ergatoudis, that the format is heading towards extinction. There were 29.7m albums downloaded in 2014, down 9% on the year before, while 52.7m CDs were bought – a drop of almost 7%.</p> <p>The changing shape of the music industry was also underlined by the growing importance of streaming. The figures disclosed that the number of tracks streamed in Britain doubled in 2014, up from 7.5bn in 2013 to 14.8bn in 2014. Revenue from streaming in Britain this year was up 65% to £175m – overtaking revenue from single sales and downloads for the first time.</p> <p>This year was the first time that streams were included alongside downloads and physical sales in the Official Top 40 charts.</p> <p>One Direction were among the musicians who achieved 1bn streams on Spotify upon the release of their album Four in November, joining the ranks of fellow Brits Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Coldplay, while Mark Ronson’s track Uptown Funk broke the record for the most streamed track in a single week, with 2.5m plays in the final week of December.</p> <p>The shift in the way people are now consuming music could prove an interesting dilemma for artists such as Taylor Swift, who this year took her entire music back catalogue from the leading streaming service Spotify in protest that artists are only paid between around $0.006 and $0.0084 per song play.</p> <p>The increase in revenue from streaming was so great this year it almost completely offset the decline in album and single sales, ensuring that this year the total retail value of albums, singles and streams dropped by only 1.6% to £1.03bn.</p> <p>The streaming market is set to become more competitive this year with Apple launching its iTunes Beats streaming service and Google’s YouTube Music Key also set to launch, to compete with the likes of Spotify and Pandora.</p> <h2>Official artist albums chart 2014</h2> <p>1.

I appreciate the Guardian highlighting what has become a disturbingly widespread trend. However, as a resident in the Gulf, I felt the throwaway line presenting the Gulf as a front line in Christian persecution was misleading. While this would be true for Saudi Arabia, the reality in other Gulf countries is far more nuanced. Though there is a large domestic workforce consisting of Christians from the Philippines, India and Ethiopia, there is also a significant Christian minority who work in the professional sector, in education, health, tourism and the oil and gas industry – in other words, we are not all impoverished servants.</p> <p>There is no persecution in the UAE, Bahrain or Oman. Living in Kuwait, I saw a lot of abuse of domestic workers, and sometimes that was related to religion, but mainly it was abuse of power rather than persecution. I have found that the ruling families have been unstintingly generous towards the church, especially in the UAE. At the recent G20 Interfaith Summit in Brisbane, as a representative of the Christian community in the UAE, I spoke about the UAE as an excellent example of religious freedom within an Islamic framework.</p> <p>I think your editorial also needs to remind readers that some of the named countries are dysfunctional to the extent where all minorities and even the majority suffers (I think of North Korea especially). Iraq is another case where Muslims who fall foul of the Isis brand of Islam are just as savagely persecuted as Christians.</p> <p>Yet Christian persecution is a reality and I thank you for raising awareness about the suffering of countless devout Christians. In the case of the Gulf, though, your editorial is an inadequate representation of the experience of the church.<br /><strong>Rev Canon Andy Thompson</strong><br /><em>Senior chaplain, St Andrew’s Church, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</em></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9929887","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216776","internalRevision":"15","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> I have found that the ruling families have been unstintingly generous towards the church, especially in the United Arab Emirates","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"The reality of being a Christian in the Gulf","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T18:42:13Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420044809825/An-Iraqi-Christian-woman--004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gmm","wordcount":"334","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420044809825/An-Iraqi-Christian-woman--004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a4268fe4b0f14bc6d27959","newspaperPageNumber":"32","internalStoryPackageCode":"83595","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T18:42:13Z","linkText":"The reality of being a Christian in the Gulf | Letter: Rev Canon Andy Thompson","creationDate":"2014-12-31T16:38:39Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:04:31Z","internalContentCode":"454074474"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/reality-of-being-christian-in-the-gulf","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/reality-of-being-christian-in-the-gulf","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"a8214aa2dc0d8d877dcd4098abf66729e38fd8de","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420044815537/An-Iraqi-Christian-woman--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","picdarUrn":"GD*45486700","suppliersReference":"BAG08","altText":"An Iraqi Christian woman sits inside a church in Telkaif near Mosul","caption":"An Iraqi Christian woman fleeing violence in the Iraqi city of Mosul, sits inside a church in Telkaif.

Italian authorities had originally thought there were 600-700 passengers by the time the ship reached in the small port city of Gallipoli, the estimated number had risen.</p> <p>The dead have been taken to a hospital and survivors to public buildings where an identification process is under way.

Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>“It’s a general mistrust of the population. We are not citizens any more – we are all terrorists,” says Rachel Graham, with irony. “Or child abusers,” her friend Leslie Barson exclaims. “We are a danger. We need to be checked and controlled.”</p> <p>This is a meeting of parents who decided to educate their children at home rather than send them to school, and they are angry because their local authority has introduced a monitoring regime for home educators, which they say infringes their civil rights as parents.</p> <p>The parents – some of whose children are long grown up – have gathered in the cafe of a central London department store to discuss home education in the context of growing concerns about safeguarding children. They feel they have become the victims of a national hysteria surrounding child safety, partly as a result of headlines about child abuse, partly because of the fallout of the “Trojan horse” plot in Birmingham.</p> <p>Their local authority, Westminster in central London, wants to visit families who are educating their children at home once a year. The council says it makes no apologies for “trying to look after the welfare of children or for seeking to ensure that they receive the highest standard of education possible”. The parents say, however, that the authority has no jurisdiction to inspect or approve home educators, and accuse Westminster of threatening to take parents who do not comply to court.</p> <p>“Parents are responsible for their children’s education,” says Barson, a mother of two now grown-up children who were home-educated. “They ramp up safeguarding – ‘if it saves just one child’ – but this is not a safeguarding issue. There is no duty on a local authority to approve home education – it’s a parental responsibility. This is about approving and monitoring.</p> <p>“I feel an inspection is an illegal infringement of my rights as a parent. The law says I’m responsible for my children’s education. The authority’s responsibility starts if there’s evidence of a problem or a concern. They think our children are at risk because they are not being seen daily by a teacher. But children are not safe just because they are at school.”</p> <p>According to Ed Yourself, a home education consultancy, in July 2014 local authorities were aware of 27,292 children being home-educated in England, a 17% increase on 2013, but others claim that many more children are out of school and off the radar.</p> <p>In December, Labour Co-operative MP Barry Sheerman called for a parliamentary debate on home schooling early in the new year, claiming that the whereabouts of up to 100,000 children were unknown. “In an age when we are ever more worried about child abuse and child protection, may we have an early debate, because that area has got out of hand?”</p> <p>Tory MP Graham Stuart, who succeeded Sheerman as chair of the cross-party education select committee, is supportive of the Westminster parents, calling on the authority to improve support and resources available to home-educating families, rather than imposing a monitoring regime.</p> <p>Until last year, the Westminster parents had a home-education policy, formally approved and adopted by the full council in February 2010, with which they were happy. It changed to include the annual visit when Westminster joined forces with Hammersmith and Fulham and Kensington and Chelsea in a tri-borough arrangement to share services.</p> <p>Rachel Graham, a former primary-school teacher who has home-educated four of her five children, aged from nine to 21, objects to the home visits: “If you have got someone coming into your home to look at what you are doing, they are making a judgment. But who are they? You don’t know what their background is or who they are.”</p> <p>Helen White, another former teacher who is home-educating her two children aged 10 and 14 and campaigns with the Westminster group, though she no longer lives there, adds: “Everything is: ‘We do not trust the parent. You have to prove to us you are innocent. You have to do it on our terms.’ I find it quite insulting, to be honest. It’s an abuse of their power.”</p> <p>According to the 2007 legislation, local authorities have no statutory duties in relation to monitoring the quality of home education on a routine basis.

During his time as editor between 1981 and 1994 the paper became the UK’s biggest selling newspaper. During thast time he was responsible for some of the Sun’s most well known headlines – from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_MacKenzie\" title=\"\">Gotcha! about the sinking of the Belgrano to “Freddie Starr ate my hamster”</a>.</p> <p>But he was also responsible for the front page story, headlined “The Truth”, which made false allegations about Liverpool FC fans during the Hillsborough disaster. Sales of the Sun on Merseyside have never recovered, even after the paper’s full page apology in 2004. Many newsagents on Merseyside continue to refuse to stock the newspaper.</p> <p>Only after the allegations were publicly discredited by an independent panel report in 2012 did <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-mackenzie-profuse-apologies-sun\" title=\"\">MacKenzie offer “profuse apologies”</a> for the story, saying he had been misled by official sources.</p> <p>It will be his second return to the Sun, having been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/01/pressandpublishing.sun\" title=\"\">signed as a columnist in 2005 </a>by then editor Rebekah Wade as a replacement for his protege <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Littlejohn\" title=\"\">Richard Littlejohn</a>. During that time MacKenzie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/13/pressandpublishing.daviddavis\" title=\"\">cemented his reputation as a tub-thumping rightwinger, </a>with pieces including one suggesting that Scottish people enjoyed spending money but not creating it.</p> <p>He left in 2011 to join the Daily Mail, writing a column which ended in July 2012 amid growing disquiet among readers as the full truth about Hillsborough emerged. However, MacKenzie told the Guardian he had stopped writing because investors in his online TV channel, Sports Tonight, wanted him to focus on it full-time.</p> <p>When MacKenzie was dropped by the Daily Telegraph after just one column in 2013 it was again felt to be criticism from sports fans supportive of the <a href=\"http://hfsg.co.uk\" title=\"\">Justice for the 96 </a>campaign. “I don’t think any newspaper should employ that man. I don’t even think he should be on the screens of our televisions. National newspapers should know the history of Hillsborough and the people involved. They know he printed that story.”</p> <p>Since 1994 MacKenzie has enjoyed a short-lived career in TV – where he introduced the news bunny and topless darts – and led a consortium that bought assets including national commercial station Talk Radio.</p> <p>After revealing that his phone had been hacked, he used his Daily Mail column to joke at the expense of his successors at the Sun mired in the phone-hacking controversy by revealing that his own voicemail message said, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2038390/Greek-debt-crisis-Why-dont-Alex-Salmonds-Scots-merge-Greece.html\" title=\"\">“I’m sorry that I am not here right now but do leave a message and Rebekah will get right back to you.”</a></p> <p>He has always been less critical of the man he has long called “the boss” at News International. “I know Rupert Murdoch and I know he would have gone ballistic at the very thought of such actions.” Murdoch is understood to be supportive of the new role.</p> <p>Earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/exsun-editor-kelvin-mackenzie-and-son-sell-video-business-for-50-million-9591601.html\" title=\"\">MacKenzie and his son Ashley sold their online video business, Base 79,</a> for an estimated £50m.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935652","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216739","internalRevision":"13","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"One of tabloid’s most controversial editors will return to his ‘alma mater’ to write a twice-weekly column ahead of general election","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Kelvin MacKenzie to get his moment in the Sun again","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Jane Martinson, media editor","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T15:56:47Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420040545766/Kelvin-MacKenzie-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gyc","wordcount":"539","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420040545766/Kelvin-MacKenzie-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a41898e4b084424a7b2e88","newspaperPageNumber":"7","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T15:56:48Z","standfirst":"One of tabloid’s most controversial editors will return to his ‘alma mater’ to write a twice-weekly column ahead of general election","linkText":"Kelvin MacKenzie to get his moment in the Sun again","creationDate":"2014-12-31T15:39:04Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:04:59Z","internalContentCode":"454072816"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/dec/31/kelvin-mackenzie-the-sun-columnist-general-election","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2014/dec/31/kelvin-mackenzie-the-sun-columnist-general-election","sectionName":"Media","elements":[{"id":"1af34438a1500a67b9c2bfd8120e2b567477b314","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420040550807/Kelvin-MacKenzie-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"DB*23978783","suppliersReference":"INQUIRY_Hillsborough_142596.JPG","altText":"Kelvin MacKenzie","caption":"Kelvin MacKenzie.

Alix Stewart is one of three people still in hospital after last week’s city centre accident in which six people died and 10 others were injured.</p> <p>The third-year pupil at Gryffe high school in Houston, Renfrewshire, had just left her mother Jacqueline, 43, and sister Emily, 16, to meet friends when she was hit by the out-of-control lorry. Her father, Colin Stewart, 48, thanked the medical staff who looked after his daughter and the people who were with her at the time of the accident.</p> <p>He told the Evening Times newspaper: “She is strong. She is a brave wee fighter. Of course, our thoughts and prayers are with the families who have lost someone. We realise how lucky we are and how lucky Alix is.”</p> <p>The teenager was caught underneath the vehicle and dragged along Queen Street, suffering broken bones, kidney and liver damage and a severe injury to her ear. On the evening of the crash she underwent surgery before being moved to a high dependency ward.</p> <p>Her parents said she managed to sit up for the first time on Monday and was able to get on her feet on Tuesday.</p> <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said a 64-year-old woman also remains in Glasgow Royal Infirmary in a stable condition. A 57-year-old man, understood to be the driver of the lorry, is also stable at the city’s Western Infirmary.</p> <p>Erin McQuade, 18, and her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the accident. Their funerals will be held on Saturday at St Patrick’s Roman Catholic parish church in the West Dunbartonshire town.</p> <p>Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, and tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the council truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium hotel in George Square.</p> <p>The family and friends of Ewing are reported to have said their final farewells to her at a funeral service in the capital on Tuesday.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936308","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216793","internalRevision":"7","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Alix Stewart is one of three people still in hospital after last week’s city centre accident in which six people died","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Parents overjoyed as girl injured in Glasgow bin lorry accident recovers","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Press Association","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T17:37:43Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420047114077/Hundreds-of-people-attend-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gnc","wordcount":"363","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420047114077/Hundreds-of-people-attend-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a43233e4b0ab1ee5e5673a","newspaperPageNumber":"14","internalStoryPackageCode":"84863","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T17:37:44Z","standfirst":"Alix Stewart is one of three people still in hospital after last week’s city centre accident in which six people died","linkText":"Parents overjoyed as girl injured in Glasgow bin lorry accident recovers","creationDate":"2014-12-31T17:28:19Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:04:34Z","internalContentCode":"454075618"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/girl-injured-glasgow-bin-lorry-accident","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/girl-injured-glasgow-bin-lorry-accident","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"6bc651af099d265aff40f7ad5216985e8907d052","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420047120598/Hundreds-of-people-attend-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"GD*49143552","suppliersReference":"POLICE_Lorry_154074.JPG","altText":"Hundreds of people attend a vigil near the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow\r","caption":"Hundreds of people attend a vigil near the Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow, after a lorry lost control killing six people.

Will the Greek people and their democratic constitution be respected and upheld by the European and US establishments which have committed billions to foreign interventions in the name of democracy and human rights, or is Europe poised to experience the overthrow of a democratically elected government within its union?</p> <p>In connection with the possibility of Syriza forming the next government, one cannot help remembering US president Lyndon Johnson’s hubristic disregard for Greek democracy when he expressed himself with regard to the Greek ambassador’s concern with the US’s preferred solution on Cyprus: “Then listen to me, Mr Ambassador, fuck your parliament and your constitution. America is an elephant. Cyprus is a flea. If these two fleas continue itching the elephant, they may just get whacked by the elephant’s trunk, whacked good … We pay a lot of good American dollars to the Greeks, Mr Ambassador. If your prime minister gives me talk about democracy, parliament and constitutions, he, his parliament and his constitution may not last very long.”<br /><strong>Russell Caplan</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• The size of the Greek economy being minuscule in comparison to the major economies in the EU, the only threat to world finance of a Syriza victory is political. It is a threat of the loss of grip on the narrative of the financial crisis, that the crisis is caused by the profligacy of the poor, in the hands of the plutocracy of global finance.</p> <p>If Syriza is allowed to retain the euro on its own terms, people elsewhere might begin to question the benefit of continuing with the particular programme of poor-bashing austerity, even if they accept the need for austerity, preached by the union leaders, the troika, of this governing plutocracy. The governing classes ask for decades of sacrifice from citizens, holding out at best only the prospect of low-paying, insecure jobs.</p> <p>If the received narrative comes into question, workers like those in Germany might begin to doubt their masters. Workers there have accepted low wages for decades without questioning the narrative of competitiveness ensuring their financial security. They would see that their sacrifice has, paradoxically, contributed to their economic insecurity by allowing for a glut of money in trade surpluses to be built up in a banking system that has developed innovative techniques of financial engineering which only reward the plutocracy in corporate boardrooms and banks, and contribute to the instability of the economic edifice that delivers jobs and prosperity to the masses.<br /><strong>SP Chakravarty</strong><br /><em>Bangor</em></p> <p>• You state (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/29/guardian-view-on-snap-elections-greece\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 30 December) that if the left-leaning Syriza wins the January election, it will ask the EU for debt forgiveness. Perhaps you should have pointed out that Germany too asked for such macroeconomic mercy after its defeat in the second world war, which was duly granted by the allies under the postwar London debt agreement, thereby paving the way for West Germany’s economic miracle.</p> <p>A debt write-off for Greece, however, although affordable, will not please German voters, as they will have to bear its cost. But such a prescription, if agreed upon, will go a long way towards lessening the growth of extreme pathologies that invariably ensue from stagnating incomes and declining living standards.<br /><strong>Randhir Singh Bains</strong><br /><em>Gants Hill, Essex</em></p> <p>• Syriza is being disingenuous in repeatedly declaring its intention of keeping Greece in the European economic and monetary union (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/29/syriza-greece-austerity-eu\" title=\"\">Syriza can transform the EU from within – if Europe will let it</a>, theguardian.com, 30 December). If you belong to a club, you have to play by the rules; which doesn’t include having your debt written off by the other member states. In order to avoid deceiving the electorate, Syriza should do the honourable thing and advocate Greece leaving the EU.<br /><strong>Stan Labovitch </strong><br /><em>Windsor, Berkshire</em></p> <p>• The people of Greece now have a stark choice: more brutal austerity in return for EU and International Monetary Fund bailouts for the banks, or a rejection of austerity altogether. With the party of the radical left, Syriza, now topping the polls, it is clear which way Greeks are leaning. If the Greeks can vote to reject austerity, so can we – we need to break the pro-austerity consensus of the main parties. Let’s make 2015 the year we put people before profit and public service before corporate greed.<br /><strong>Jenny Sutton</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.tusc.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition</em></a><em> parliamentary candidate, Tottenham</em></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9929893","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216746","internalRevision":"21","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Letters:</strong> If Syriza is allowed to retain the euro on its own terms, people elsewhere might begin to question the benefit of continuing with poor-bashing austerity","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"People power put to the test in Greek elections","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T18:58:15Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420041607166/Alexis-Tsipras-head-of-Gr-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gyj","wordcount":"770","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420041607166/Alexis-Tsipras-head-of-Gr-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a41ae1e4b084424a7b2e8a","newspaperPageNumber":"32","internalStoryPackageCode":"83580","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T18:58:17Z","linkText":"People power put to the test in Greek elections | Letters","creationDate":"2014-12-31T15:48:49Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:04:31Z","internalContentCode":"454073033"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/people-power-test-greek-elections","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/people-power-test-greek-elections","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"031ee0cb4c9cf7b36f68f3a6d1f7ad87db00d8ad","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420041612739/Alexis-Tsipras-head-of-Gr-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","picdarUrn":"GD*49158650","suppliersReference":"YAN13","altText":"Alexis Tsipras, head of Greece's radical leftist Syriza party","caption":"Alexis Tsipras (left), head of Greece’s leftist Syriza party.

She said it had never been the case the local authority was “seeking to isolate the child from her family”, pointing out that the granddaughter’s maternal family “have regular contact”.</p> <p>Outside court, Danby said she had been put through “a humiliating ordeal”.</p> <p>Asked if she had been scared in jail however, she laughed, replying: “No, I wasn’t scared.</p> <p>“I don’t scare easily.”</p> <p>Asked about what her views were on the county council’s decision to apply for contempt of court proceedings, she replied: “You really don’t want to know - there aren’t words to describe what I think of Derbyshire County Council.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935567","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216669","internalRevision":"20","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Judge reduces Kathleen Danby’s three-month sentence to time already served","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Woman jailed for breaching court order by hugging granddaughter is freed","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Press Association","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T13:23:32Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420032088443/Justice-statue-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gtn","wordcount":"533","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420032088443/Justice-statue-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a3f755e4b0ab1ee5e56721","newspaperPageNumber":"9","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-07T13:23:32Z","standfirst":"Judge reduces Kathleen Danby’s three-month sentence to time already served","linkText":"Woman jailed for breaching court order by hugging granddaughter is freed","creationDate":"2014-12-31T13:17:09Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:04:01Z","internalContentCode":"454068024"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/31/woman-jailed-hugging-granddaughter-court-freed-birmingham","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/law/2014/dec/31/woman-jailed-hugging-granddaughter-court-freed-birmingham","sectionName":"Law","elements":[{"id":"1067017b33619efc4ee89e67a0572e33b9e9cddd","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420032093658/Justice-statue-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"PD*4205482","suppliersReference":"COURTS Girls 9","altText":"Justice statue","caption":"Danby's three-month sentence had been handed down this year by Birmingham's court of protection.

One was wearing an AirAsia flight attendant uniform.<br /></p> <p>However, an official clarified an earlier statement he had made that one of the bodies recovered had been wearing a life jacket. “There is no victim that has been found wearing a life jacket,” said Tatang Zaenudin, deputy head of operations at the national search and rescue agency. “We found a body at 8.20am and a life jacket at 10.32am so there was a time difference. This is the latest information we have.” <br /></p> <p>Divers and sonar-equipped ships were standing by to continue the search once weather conditions improved. Soelistyo said the plane’s fuselage had not yet been found. <br /></p> <p>However, sonar imaging has established the presence of an object 100-165 feet (30-50 metres) under water, which officials say could be the body of the plane. No survivors have been found, and the plane’s black box flight data and cockpit voice recorder have not been recovered.<br /></p> <p>The flight vanished from radar screens early on Sunday morning while carrying 162 passengers from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore. The pilot reportedly asked air controllers for permission to rise from 32,000 feet to 38,000 feet to avoid a storm cloud, moments before losing contact. He did not send a distress signal.<br /></p> <p>When the weather eases ships will continue to scour the Karimata Strait, about 60 miles (100km) from the plane’s last recorded coordinates, where searchers began finding scattered debris on Tuesday, including an oxygen bottle, an unopened blue suitcase and a life raft.</p> <p>Aviation experts are trying to figure out whether the plane hit the water intact or broke up in mid-air. “It’s important to know because that tells you whether it was a force like a storm that destroyed the plane in the air or if it was a matter of the pilots losing control and never able to recover from it,” the Australia-based aviation security expert Desmond Ross <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/debris-almost-certain-from-plane-found/2014/12/30/f2fc50fe-8ff5-11e4-a412-4b735edc7175_story.html\">told the Washington Post</a>.<br /></p> <p>Experts said any details about the use of the life jacket would provide insight into whether people on board the plane had had time to prepare themselves before they hit the water.<br /></p> <p>If a passenger was wearing a life jacket, “it means the thing didn’t just fall out of the sky”, an unnamed pilot <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/31/us-indonesia-airplane-idUSKBN0K900D20141231\">told Reuters</a>, adding that a plane could fall from 30,000 feet to sea level in about a minute, and that the pilots may have been “too overloaded” to send out a distress call.<br /></p> <p>A navy spokesman said on Tuesday night that more than 40 bodies had been recovered, but on Wednesday said the figure was wrong and attributed the error to a “miscommunication”.<br /></p> <p>Indonesian authorities said 130 ambulances were ready to take bodies to hospital for identification. On Wednesday, the first two recovered bodies were put in coffins and flown to Surayaba, a major metropolis 400 miles south-east of Jakarta, where friends and relatives of those onboard have gathered to wait for updates.<br /></p> <p>The relatives <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/30/airasia-flight-qz8501-confirmation-plane-debris\">learned of the plane’s fate</a> while watching live television on Tuesday night, when Indonesia’s TvOne broadcaster showed images of a partially clothed body floating in the water. Many of them reportedly burst into tears, AFP reported; at least one fainted, and one was carried out on a stretcher. The station quickly apologised for airing the images.<br /></p> <p>The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, travelled to Surayaba on Tuesday night to comfort the families. “I pray for your strength in facing this tragedy,” he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Map: plane's location\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1420019709227/Indonesia_Plane_Found_01011.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The Indonesian pilot, a former air force fighter pilot with 6,100 flying hours, was experienced and the plane last underwent maintenance in mid-November, said the airline, which is 49%-owned by Malaysia-based budget carrier AirAsia.</p> <p> Three airline disasters involving Malaysian-affiliated carriers in less than a year have dented confidence in the country’s aviation industry and spooked travellers across the region.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370\"> Malaysia Airlines flight MH370</a> went missing in March on a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew and has not been found.

Photograph: Reuters/Suzanne Plunkett</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>In a year of growing income extremes, when the gap between the richest, the poorest and the rest seems more fixed than ever, there is one welcome advance in an area of established inequality. As Rebecca Solnit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/30/-sp-rebecca-solnit-listen-up-women-are-telling-their-story-now\" title=\"\">argued on these pages</a> on Tuesday, women’s voices are assuming unprecedented authority. A couple of weeks earlier a Time magazine writer claimed, even more boldly, that 2014 was <a href=\"http://time.com/3639944/feminism-2014-womens-rights-ray-rice-bill-cosby/\" title=\"\">the best year for women “since the dawn of time”</a>. Both writers rested their case on the strength and effectiveness of protests at violence against women, from shootings and campus rape to Twitter trolling and misogynist postings on social media. They make a point that is both important and remarkable. Important, because the weight of these protests is setting new behavioural norms; remarkable, less because they are happening now than that they have not happened before.</p> <p>Why 2014? Why did this past year become the moment when, say, American footballers and British soccer players and, more importantly, their clubs, found themselves pilloried for conduct that had previously been ignored? The number of players in the US National Football League <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/arrests/\" title=\"\">arrested for domestic violence</a> is in steep decline, yet this was the year when one – shocking – video of a player, Ray Rice, punching his girlfriend in the face provoked the NFL into banning him indefinitely. The ban was subsequently withdrawn after a legal challenge. The protests go on. In the UK, an attempt by the former Sheffield United player Ched Evans to rebuild his career after he had served time for a rape conviction seems to have been abandoned after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/13/jessica-ennis-hill-name-stand-ched-evans-contract-sheffield-united\" title=\"\">Jessica Ennis-Hill and other high-profile supporters of the club threatened to withdraw their backing</a> if Evans was allowed to return to training. It was also the year when prosecutions for historical sex abuse finally began to win convictions, and, at the other end of the spectrum, it was the year when the Rosetta space probe scientist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/nov/14/rosetta-comet-dr-matt-taylor-apology-sexist-shirt\" title=\"\">Matt Taylor was reduced to tears</a> after he was pilloried on social media for celebrating <a href=\"http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/\" title=\"\">Philae’s successful landing</a> on comet 67P wearing a shirt featuring semi-naked women.</p> <p>It is easy but misleading to imagine that the surge in anger about violence against women <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2014/dec/17/2014-the-year-women-won-video\" title=\"\">reflects a growing trend of violence</a>, rather than protest against it. But campus rape, for example, and even the abduction of young women in Nigeria, are not new phenomena. It is the globalisation of protest against them that is groundbreaking. Twitter’s capacity for mobilising opinion and then providing a platform for sustained criticism is part of the story. Rebecca Solnit describes it as “barn-building”, the collective power of experience and evidence, that gives feminists the capacity to frame the debate.</p> <p>But 2014 was also a year of other significant, if more conventional, gains in gender equality. It was the year when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/10/malala-yousafzia-nobel-peace-prize-attack\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel peace prize</a>, the year when William Hague and Angelina Jolie launched a campaign to make rape a war crime, when women were finally able to become bishops in the Church of England, and the year Janet Yellen was appointed as the first female governor of the US Federal Reserve. So it seems at least possible that the new salience in the news and in campaigning of violence against women could not have happened without the long, hard fight to win women a place in public life that came before it – and at the same time that future advances will come from the new version of feminist solidarity that social media enables.</p> <p>For the year ahead looks as certain as these things can be to consolidate the advances that women have made. In May’s general election, according to <a href=\"http://constitution-unit.com/2014/11/11/the-new-political-class-of-2015/\" title=\"\">research by the Constitution Unit</a>, around 40% of new Labour candidates will be female. In the party’s most winnable marginals, it will be 57%. In Germany, Angela Merkel’s most likely successor as CDU leader is a woman. Most significant, in the next few months it will finally be clear whether Hillary Clinton, who put women’s rights at <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/05/12/judging-hillary-clinton-as-secretary-of-state/clinton-was-a-powerful-voice-for-women-around-the-world\" title=\"\">the heart of US policy while she was secretary of state,</a> is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.

We tried to calm people but their desperation seems to be growing.”</p> <p>Cars belonging to the PAK company were smashed and had their windows broken on one occasion in 2012, and borehole drills were vandalised. The police subsequently took the names of more than 500 local people who came to a protest with tractors, further inflaming tensions.</p> <p>“This country faced more than 40 years of communism and the police were trying to use the same methods,” said Sylvia Mackowiak (no relation), the president of the 5,000-strong local farmers’ association.</p> <p>Although it is a grassroots campaign, 18 local companies are also supporting it, fearing crop production shortfalls, rising air pollution levels, and a drastic depletion of local water tables over a 31-mile (50km) radius.</p> <p>Heinz, the region’s biggest employer, has been at the forefront of the corporate objectors. The firm’s factory in the area depends on local farmers’ crops for its products, a quarter of which are exported to other countries. The UK is its biggest export destination.</p> <p>“The coalmine would negatively affect Heinz’s business activities as well as the entire economic ecosystem of the region,” said Leszek Wenderski, the factory’s quality manager.</p> <p>Heinz bought the factory from the 100-year-old Polish household brand Pudliszki in 1997 and both firms use locally grown tomatoes, sweetcorn, green peas and sugar beet in tinned and bottled products, such as Heinz Ketchup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"705264568eb826e5c9ff15225cb752fd9ef117ea\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419268813537/bfab0b24-5826-4c67-a1b8-d560ce58a073-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Heinz\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slawomir Paszkier, the Heinz plant’s regional manager.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Neslen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“We will have to buy produce from outside this region if the plant is built,” said Slawomir Paszkier, the Heinz/Pudliszki site manager. “For some crops that won’t be possible. Teaching new potential growers is also a long process, and not as profitable.”</p> <p>Around Poland’s Turek and Konin mines, groundwater levels have dropped by 50-80m because of mining activity, which involved the draining or diversion of rivers and tributaries, and a diminution in quality of that which remains.</p> <p>The open circulation of cooling water caused thermal changes to groundwater reservoirs. These were also contaminated by chemicals because of the flushing and leaching of coal ash, a waste product of coal-burning during rainfalls.</p> <p>But the Krobia and Miejska Górka region holds an estimated billion tonnes of brown coal beneath its well-ploughed soil and digging it up could be a profitable, if dirty affair. When burned, this low-grade lignite emits more carbon dioxide than hard coal or crude oil, and twice as much as natural gas.</p> <p>In health terms too, an estimated 450,000 people die prematurely in Europe each year because of air pollution from coal-fired emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, as well as heavy metals like mercury, lead, nickel and cadmium.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.env-health.org/IMG/pdf/heal_background_paper_lignite_health_brandenburg_english.pdf\">One study</a> of five lignite-fired coal plants on the German-Polish border estimated their yearly health and environmental cost at between €3-€5bn (£2.4-£4bn).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a99a97c96c309bd647eb7672c1be45e9c3e578af\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419268934565/d504fd18-55eb-42a5-bb93-cae6dc86101f-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"coal mine protest poland \" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Mackowicz, president of farmers’ association. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Neslen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Benedykt Pepliński of Poznan University said that the lost agricultural production from the proposed new mine could reach €1.3-€2.4bn over a 50-year period.</p> <p>“Experience from previous opencast pit mines proves that after mining operations have ended, the quality and quantity of agricultural production is much lower than before because of problems with the underground water system,” he said. “For sure, 60% of the agricultural land here would be lost forever.”</p> <p>EU investments could also be harmed. The bloc has funnelled over €550m of subsidies to the region in the 2007-2020 period, for land reclamation, hiking trails, bicycle paths and, significantly, wind power.</p> <p>Campaigners expect one wind farm and 11 wind turbines would have to be destroyed by the lignite mine.</p> <p>But Brussels has traditionally faced two ways on Polish fossil fuels projects, allowing big national firms to benefit from up to €1.7bn of funds in its current budget, according to CEE Bankwatch.</p> <p>Poland is currently bidding for billions more euros to help fund coal projects such as a new opencast lignite mine and power plant in Gubin, as well as hard coal plants in Laziska, Czeczott and Kozienice, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/analysis/documents-eu-infrastructure-funds-could-back-polish-coal#comments\">a Greenpeace analysis</a> of commission documents says.</p> <p>Jacek Kwasniewski, 51, a villager in nearby Przyborowo, is one of the local farmers who was forced to let PAK drill boreholes on his land, after a court order was obtained.</p> <p>“I still can’t imagine an opencast pit mine being built here,” he said on the fringes of a local demonstration against the mine. “I support the idea of wind farms instead. If the pit is built, I will lose about 850 hectares of land that belonged to me and five generations of my family before me.”</p> <p>If forced from his farm, Jacek said he did not know where he would go. “I’ve been a farmer my whole life,” he said. “I always wanted to be a farmer and its hard for me to think of doing something else. This land is everything for me. I cant imagine my future without it.”</p> <p>The strength of local feeling helped re-elect Jacek Widynski, mayor of the region’s biggest town, Poniec, after he fought a campaign centred on conservation of the area’s forests and agriculture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a0e0c94191de9ae4255bdd1c35800ab6ece755c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419269047959/6bdf9373-193d-4c1e-bc17-99d6c67cc5a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Farmer, Poland\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacek Kwasniewska, a local farmer, was forced to let mining company PAK drill boreholes on his land following a court order. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arthur Neslen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind his desk in the local town hall, he punctuated an interview by opening a desk-side illustrated book and pointing out local fauna that could be threatened by the lignite pit – white-tailed eagles, foxes, boars, does and partridges.</p> <p>“I can’t find words to describe the tragedy,” he said balefully. “It would be like an ecological bomb with shock waves rippling across the surrounding counties and area. The destruction of nature brought by the project and the impact on peoples’ lives would be much greater than any financial profits.”</p> <p>“Why isn’t the EU putting pressure on the Polish government for a more environmentally friendly production of energy?” he asked. “And why isn’t the Polish government more interested in small investors who want to build windfarms? Why do they encounter so many obstacles?”</p> <p>Opinion polls say that 70% of local people are against the mine, although the issue ranks lower in importance than jobs and infrastructure – particularly roads.</p> <p>Local folklore harks back to Polish patriots who built trailers on their land when refused permits by the Prussians in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and outsiders who have moved into nearby villages are distrusted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Poland's planned open cast coal mine\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1419331820822/Poland_Mine_WEB241214.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Anecdotally, real estate prices in the region are among the highest in Poland, partly because people are so loathe to sell, and partly because the soil is among Poland’s most fertile.</p> <p>Janusz Mackowiak said that he had refused an offer of 2m Polish Zlotys (€469,342) from PAK for his farmland. “The company is trying to buy famers and corrupt the people here but there is no money in the world that I would sell my farmland for,” he said. “An opencast pit here would be like stabbing our people in the heart.”</p> <p>His son, Nikodem nodded vigorously. “This is our land.

She returned to the UK on Sunday night and told officials at Heathrow she felt unwell but was allowed to catch a British Airways flight to Glasgow.</p> <p>The 39-year-old was diagnosed with Ebola the next morning and is receiving specialist treatment in a high-level isolation unit at the Royal Free hospital in London. A spokesman for the hospital declined to comment on her condition on Wednesday morning, but said an update would be issued in due course.</p> <p>Dr Martin Deahl, a fellow NHS volunteer who returned to the UK with Cafferkey, told the Guardian that she almost certainly would have contracted the virus outside the treatment centre, which has strict protocols to protect staff and patients.</p> <p>“I’m sure she did [contract it] outside the treatment centre,” he said. “I can’t imagine that anyone following the procedures and protocols in the treatment centre would have contracted it.”</p> <p>Save the Children runs an 80-bed treatment centre in Kerry Town, which is believed to be where Cafferkey was based. A spokeswoman for the charity confirmed that it has volunteers working at the facility but could not say whether they were from the UK or whether more NHS health workers were due to fly out.</p> <p>The Department for International Development said it expected more volunteers to be trained and deployed in the coming weeks. A DfID spokeswoman said a team of 25 travelled to Africa on 6 December and a dozen medics flew out on 21 December.</p> <p>The chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, conceded that the case raised questions over Ebola screening precautions.</p> <p>“We regularly keep under review what we are doing because this is a new process,” she told ITV’s Good Morning Britain.</p> <p>“Clearly, queuing and things like that are unacceptable and we will review. But we will let people who are well travel because they will not infect the public.”</p> <p>She said Cafferkey had been well. “She had no symptoms. Her temperature was within the acceptable range. She would not be transmitting the virus, therefore she was cleared as fit to fly.”</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesman said: “We have been clear – this person was tested as part of the screening process at Heathrow and, as with all health workers, she was advised to contact PHE [Public Health England] if she had any concerns. She did this while still at Heathrow and went through a further six temperature checks.</p> <p>“Her temperature was in acceptable ranges and she was cleared for onward travel, with the advice that if she did start to feel unwell, she should contact health authorities.</p> <p>“After this person got home, she alerted health authorities that she was experiencing symptoms and was admitted to hospital for tests.

Washington had been working strenuously to avoid having to use its veto.</p> <p>Until shortly before the vote on Tuesday, council diplomats had expected the resolution to get nine yes votes. But Nigeria abstained, with its ambassador, U Joy Ogwu, echoing the US position in saying that the path to peace lay “in a negotiated solution”.</p> <p>One Palestinian source involved in the negotiations told the Guardian: “Even half an hour before the vote, Nigeria indicated it was committed to voting for the resolution. We knew that Rwanda, South Korea and Australia would not back it, but we believed Nigeria was on board.”</p> <p>The apparent change by Nigeria, which is a rotating member of the council, came after both the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the US secretary of state, John Kerry, phoned the country’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, to ask him not to support the resolution.</p> <p>A State Department spokesman said on Tuesday that Kerry had called a number of senior foreign officials, including Jonathan, before the vote. Arriving at primary elections for leadership of his Likud party on Wednesday, Netanyahu confirmed he had spoken to both Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Jonathan before the UN vote. “I spoke with both of them,” he told reporters. “They promised me personally that they would not support this decision and they stood by their words. That is what tipped the scales.”</p> <p>Netanyahu had a private meeting with the Nigerian president – seen by Israel as a potential ally on the security council – during the latter’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem in October.</p> <p>Only eight countries voted in favour of the resolution, with the US – which opposed the motion – not using the veto it is granted as one of the five permanent members of the council.</p> <p>After the vote, the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, took a swipe at the European countries which backed the resolution. “The Palestinian disregard to the international community’s most important countries – particularly the US – stems from the backing they receive from certain European countries,” he said.</p> <p>Palestinian and French officials indicated they would continue working to find a text to put to the council, perhaps within weeks.</p> <p>Before the vote, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said the Palestinians could return to the security council, which, from Thursday, will have five new members who are viewed as more sympathetic to their cause.</p> <p>The Palestinian leadership was due to meet on Wednesday evening to consider its response, including whether to apply immediately for membership of the international criminal court, a move the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has long been threatening to make.</p> <p>However, despite the defeat for the Arab-supported campaign to gain security council backing for a move towards a Palestinian state, the vote held minimal comfort for Israel as it saw two European countries, France and Luxembourg, support the resolution. Only the US and Australia voted against it.</p> <p>Palestinian officials had long believed the resolution was likely to be defeated by a US veto but had hoped to secure the nine votes to highlight what they argue is Washington’s partisan advocacy on behalf of Israel in the Middle East peace process.</p> <p>The US, Israel’s closest ally, had made clear it opposed the set timetable in the draft resolution, insisting instead on a negotiated peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>“We voted against this resolution not because we are comfortable with the status quo. We voted against it because ... peace must come from hard compromises that occur at the negotiating table,” the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, said.</p> <p>She described the decision to bring the draft resolution to a vote as a “staged confrontation that will not bring the parties closer”. Of the resolution itself, she said it was “deeply unbalanced” and didn’t take into account Israel’s security concerns.</p> <p>“Our effort was a serious effort, genuine effort, to open the door for peace,” said Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN. “Unfortunately, the security council is not ready to listen to that message.”</p> <p>Erekat said in a statement after the vote: “We presented a resolution that is fully in line with international law, and which recalls several previously approved resolutions by the United Nations. “Although the majority of the security council voted in favour of the resolution, once again, certain countries continue to ensure impunity to the Israeli occupation and its severe international law violations by not voting in favour of the resolution.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934888","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216557","internalRevision":"18","publication":"The

Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Two rival vigilante leaders and dozens of their followers from the western state of Michoacán have given themselves up to the authorities in the wake of a gun battle between their groups that left 11 people dead and fuelled fears that a major government operation was failing to control the drug war hotspot.</p> <p>Luis Antonio Torres, nicknamed “Simón El Americano”, surrendered on Tuesday along with nine of his men at a prearranged pick up point. He was flown to jail in a navy helicopter to face judicial hearings. El Americano’s sworn rival, Hipólito Mora, gave himself up three days before along with 26 of his followers.</p> <p>One of Mora’s sons was among those who died in the shootout on 16 December, which took place at a barricade set up by his group in his hometown of La Ruana, in the long-conflictive region of the Tierra Caliente, or the Hot Land.</p> <p>Alfredo Castillo, the presidential envoy in charge of the federal security operation in the state, celebrated the voluntary incarceration of the vigilantes as evidence that Michoacán’s institutions have been immeasurably strengthened in recent months.</p> <p>“We secured the surrender of these people to the courts without a shot being fired or any shootouts,” Castillo said after the detention of El Americano. “What has been achieved today would have been unthinkable a year ago.”</p> <p>Castillo said he hoped a further 19 vigilantes involved in the shootout two weeks ago will also give themselves up in the coming days. He also sort to down play the shootout, saying it was not a public security issue but one of “social conflict”.</p> <p>The armed vigilante groups emerged in the Tierra Caliente in 2013, claiming that government inaction in the face of a reign of terror imposed in the region by the Caballeros Templarios, or Knights Templar, drug cartel gave them no other option for protecting their communities.</p> <p>With the situation threatening to degenerate into a regional civil war, the government flooded the area with federal forces in January this year. A subsequent uneasy alliance with the vigilantes lead to a series of important arrests and deaths of Caballeros leaders that left the cartel seriously weakened.</p> <p>But violence in the state has continued as government efforts to institutionalise the vigilantes into a rural police force have struggled in the face of deep rivalries between some of the leaders. The new rural police has also been damaged by multiple accusations that a significant number of commanders and officers have links to the Caballeros or other gangs operating in the region.</p> <p>Both El Americano and Mora joined the new rural police.

Around 4,200 police officers will be on duty across the city, both within and outside the ticketed areas, including some watching over the crowds from podiums.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: “Our advice is not to travel into London if you don’t have a ticket. If people are still considering coming to see the fireworks it will be extremely difficult to get around. Areas will be cordoned off for those with tickets and Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square will not this year be featuring large viewing screens.”</p> <p>The London Ambulance Service said it was already getting busier earlier in the day and predicted that New Year’s Eve would once again be its busiest night of the year.</p> <p>People were urged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ldn_Ambulance/status/550316733756489730\" title=\"\">only to call in a genuine emergency</a> by the service, which was taking over 600 calls an hour at peak times last year when normally it would take around 250.</p> <p>It is running three alcohol recovery centres and five “booze buses” across London to look after people who have had too much to drink, in addition to 11 treatment centres in conjunction with St John Ambulance volunteers for anyone who is injured or unwell within the event area.</p> <p>Members of the pubic were advised by the ambulance service to eat before drinking alcohol and to avoid “stronger continental beers”.</p> <p>In Edinburgh, there were still tickets available on Tuesday for the city’s 75,000-capacity Hogmanay street party, although other events, including a candlelit concert at St Giles’ cathedral and a ceilidh at the Mound precinct, were sold out.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936321","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216811","internalRevision":"8","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"London mayor says last year’s crowded conditions meant free event was ‘untenable’ but critics say he is privatising New Year","allowUgc":"false","headline":"New Year’s Eve revellers without tickets warned away from London fireworks","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Ben Quinn","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T18:04:14.595Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420048975579/Half-a-million-people-att-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gz3","wordcount":"549","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420048975579/Half-a-million-people-att-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a438e7e4b048dfa4053b37","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T18:04:16Z","standfirst":"London mayor says last year’s crowded conditions meant free event was ‘untenable’ but critics say he is privatising New Year","linkText":"New Year’s Eve revellers without tickets warned away from London fireworks","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T18:09:57.000Z","internalContentCode":"454076223"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/new-years-eve-london-fireworks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/new-years-eve-london-fireworks","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"87d06c2ca93d04bbb14a4ae9fe51244e252c57f1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420048983146/Half-a-million-people-att-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP Images","picdarUrn":"GD*40506074","suppliersReference":"UKRC102","altText":"Half a million people attended last year's free New Year's Eve celebrations in London","caption":"Half a million people attended last year's free New Year's Eve celebrations in London.

A few hours later, just after midnight and standing in the shadow of Big Ben in Parliament Square, he called home to wish his father Happy New Year – and that was the UK’s first ever mobile phone call.</p> <p>Michael Harrison had dragged the 5kg (11lb) briefcase-sized prototype phone with him to make the call in a dummy run hours before comedian Ernie Wise was due to make the first official mobile phone call from St Katherine’s Docks in London.</p> <p>In the call, Michael Harrison said: “Hi Dad. It’s Mike. This is the first-ever call made on a UK commercial mobile network.” On the other end of the line, champagne corks popped and photographers recorded the moment.</p> <p>Later that day, Wise – dressed in top hat and period costume – made the first official mobile call to Vodafone’s then headquarters above an Indian restaurant in Newbury, Berkshire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baeae44b76cd30cc006d1ff012a72de839186231\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420039763092/99989622-65fc-46c2-be50-2571f6ce3160-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Transportable Vodafone VT1.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Transportable Vodafone VT1.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vodafone/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harrison’s Vodafone, a start-up from inside the wider Racal defence and electronics company, had beaten BT Cellnet to start the UK’s first mobile network by just nine days.</p> <p>By the end of 1985, more than 12,000 mobile phones had been sold for about £2,000 each (the equivalent of about £5,000 now). The phones were marketed in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi adverts featuring Ferrari-driving businessmen with the slogan: “You can be in when you’re out.”</p> <p>Today, Vodafone has 438 million customers around the world. The UK mobile phone industry made more £15.6bn in 2013, with more than 83 million people signed up – far more than the UK’s population of 64 million.</p> <p>Those users made 134bn calls and sent around 130bn texts last year.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 2 January 2015. The original headline wrongly stated that the phone call took place on New Year’s Eve, instead of early on New Year’s Day. The caption wrongly named the Vodafone chairman as Sir Michael Harrison, instead of Sir Ernest Harrison. The article also wrongly suggested that Ernie Wise’s call had been made a day after Michael Harrison’s, instead of the same day. These have been corrected.<br

first few days of 2015.</p> <p>With just over four months until voters go to the polls on 7 May, the leaders of the two main parties are expected to start spending much more time talking to voters around the country instead of working from Westminster.</p> <p>On Friday the prime minister is planning to launch his first campaign event of the year, and on Sunday he is expected to be interviewed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. The Labour leader, meanwhile, is likely to start the year with a major speech early next week.</p> <p>Both parties have established what they call their narratives for the election. The Conservatives intend to focus on their economic record, while Labour will promise to address the cost of living and reduce inequality. With the polls continuing to show a lead for Miliband, the Conservatives are expected to start bombarding the public with their political messages over the coming weeks.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jcUY3QtuWw\">prime minister’s new year message </a>continued the Tories’ familiar refrain of urging people “to stick to the plan, stay on course to prosperity, and keep doing the important, long-term work of securing a better future”. Cameron claimed there was good news on employment, lower taxes and a higher state pension, but warned that the global economy remained uncertain. “Britain has a choice,” he said, “between the competence that has got us this far, or the chaos of giving it up, going backwards and taking huge risks.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jcUY3QtuWw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jcUY3QtuWw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>David Cameron’s new year message</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In an article for the Daily Telegraph today, he writes that the Conservatives are not just improving the economy, but “changing British values” in favour of hard work.</p> <p>Miliband’s message had a strongly positive tone, reflecting his intention to present his party as one of hope and change over the next few months.</p> <p>“This is the season for new beginnings and hopes for the future,” he said. “And Britain is ready for a new beginning. Because I don’t have to tell you that all over our country today there are people working harder and harder, but standing still; families struggling with bills that are growing faster than their wages; young people taking on mountains of debt to get a proper education, only to find themselves with no job at the other end; and an NHS where people are waiting longer and longer to get the care they need.</p> <p>“It doesn’t have to be this way. As this new year dawns, we have the chance to change direction; a chance to build a recovery for all of Britain … This year, we have the power to bring about the change working families all over Britain need. This isn’t about idle dreams or empty promises. It’s about a real, concrete plan: a plan for a recovery which reaches your kitchen table.”</p> <p>Jim Murphy, the new Labour leader in Scotland, and his deputy, Kezia Dugdale, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbjjLi63QgA\">also released a new year message</a>.

It features in the TV programme Friday Night Feast, which starts on Friday night on Channel 4.</p> <p>In the first programme, the pair meet farmers who tell them that they were unable to sell thousands of tonnes of their fresh vegetables to supermarkets because they were deemed imperfect. They approached Asda to suggest a small trial in store – filmed for the programme – to gauge customer perceptions of wonky produce and whether they would be willing to buy it at a discount.</p> <p>“If most Brits had half an idea of the amount going to waste, they’d be snapping up ugly veg by the trolley load,” Oliver said. “There’s no difference whatsoever in taste or nutritional value. This is perfectly good food that could and should be eaten by humans. When half a million people in the UK are relying on food banks, this waste isn’t just bonkers – it’s bordering on criminal.”</p> <p>Fruit and vegetables in Asda’s new Beautiful on the Inside range will be bagged separately and sold for 30% less than their “perfect” peers, as the supermarket hopes to educate shoppers on the benefits of “buying ugly” while also supporting farmers. The campaign and dedicated range will launch in selected stores from 26 January, with a view to being rolled out nationally.</p> <h2>Shape up or ship out<br /></h2> <p>In July 2009, a controversial EU ban on fresh produce (26 types of fruit and vegetables) that failed to match standard shapes and sizes – such as bent carrots, curled cucumbers and knobbly potatoes – was lifted. Up to that point, an estimated 20% to 40% of UK fruit and vegetables was routinely rejected before it reached the shops. But an expected deluge of wonky veg onto supermarket shelves failed to materialise.</p> <p>The supermarkets blamed consumers for being obsessed with perfection, while farmers blamed supermarkets for sticking to rigid, high technical specifications. Retailers have gradually been relaxing these, and food banks and organisations such as Food Cycle have been grateful recipients of rejected produce. But successive reports on food waste in the supply chain show that much more could be done to make use of edible, if misshapen, foods.</p> <p>Ian Harrison, produce technical director at Asda said: “Even if fruit and veg have some knobbles and blemishes, this doesn’t affect the quality or taste – a carrot is still a carrot. Customers are simply looking for great-tasting, fresh produce at a value price. Our growers are savvy and already use a large percentage of this wonky crop for further processing, for things like ready meals and juicing, but we saw an opportunity to extend this even more.”</p> <p>In the first programme Oliver and Doherty meet farmers Olly and Kevin Hammond, who have been growing carrots and parsnips at Tattersett Farm in Norfolk since 1959. Doherty said: “Anything that doesn’t make the grade gets chucked. It’s a massive waste for farmers. Where ‘A’ grade carrots sell for £800 a tonne, they practically give the ugly ones away for animal feed for just £10.”</p> <p>The move is supported by the government’s food waste reduction advisory body Wrap, which has said that loss and waste in the fresh produce supply chain averaged out at less than 10% but could be as high as 25% for apples, onions and potatoes.</p> <p>Other large supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s and Waitrose have relaxed their specifications to sell some ugly and imperfect produce, but this is the first initiative to clearly identify and separate them from the mainstream alternative. Emma Marsh, head of <a href=\"http://www.lovefoodhatewaste.com\">Love Food Hate Waste</a>, said: “Buying misshapen or blemished fruit and vegetables doesn’t mean you are sacrificing any of the taste. Food costs money and precious resources to produce, so we should value it.”</p> <p>Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink research at the market research company Mintel, commented: “It is clear that consumers are open to ugly produce, but where oddly shaped fruit and veg sits with mainstream offerings, it is at risk of going unchosen, even if subconsciously. Price comes across as a real consideration for many and positioning ugly fruit and vegetables as a tasty, low-cost option should help to reach this group.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936056","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216834","internalRevision":"22","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Asda to sell produce at discount in national trial starting end of January in drive to cut down on food waste","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Jamie Oliver leads drive to buy misshapen fruit and vegetables","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rebecca Smithers, consumers affairs correspondent","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-01-01T07:00:03Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7438c9bf89ae78e1a59db8989b1e7adc457b24a7\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420052014513/Jamie-Oliver-003.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Oliver\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jimmy Doherty, Tinie Tempah and Jamie Oliver in  Channel 4's Friday Night Feast.

He said he was horrified to see images of two fellow allied translators with whom he lived in barracks in Kunar province being murdered by the Taliban.</p> <p>The men, who Rafi believes are his friends Yahyah and Achikzai, are shown struggling as they are held down and their heads attacked with a handheld knife. A caption in Pashto describes them as spies.</p> <p>Rafi, who is fighting for the right to allow his wife and three children to join him in Britain, believes the men were killed in 2006 by a Taliban commander. His lawyers, Leigh Day, revealed the footage to him last month.</p> <p>“Yahyah and Achikzai were specifically targeted because they were interpreters for the allies. It still breaks my heart to think of what happened to these good-hearted, courageous men,” Rafi said.</p> <p>A judicial review is expected to be heard next year on arguments on behalf of Rafi and two other Afghan interpreters that the British government’s scheme offered to locally employed staff by the British armed forces in Afghanistan is unlawful and inferior to the one offered to interpreters who worked with British forces in Iraq.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Ashdown and the former chief of naval staff Lord West have called for ministers to fulfil a “debt of honour” and accept about 450 Afghan interpreters who helped British servicemen in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Following withdrawal from Iraq, local interpreters who had worked for the British for more than a year were offered a targeted assistance scheme, through which they could either accept a one-off package of financial assistance, exceptional indefinite leave to enter the UK or the opportunity to resettle in the UK.</p> <p>But the Afghan redundancy programme offers only the chance to relocate to Britain for interpreters who worked with British forces in Helmand province for a minimum of 12 months and were employed in December 2012.</p> <p>The offer is also inferior in other regards, the lawyers say. The hundreds who stopped work before the cut-off date but who also face death threats have to rely on a separate intimidation policy. Only one interpreter has been deemed to be at a sufficiently high risk to get a visa.</p> <p>When shown the footage of the Taliban murder, he says he immediately recognised his friends Yahyah and Achikzai, with whom he had lived for four months in Allied barracks in Kunar Province. His friends went on to join a US mission in Uruzgan, Rafi said, but were then captured and handed to the Taliban.</p> <p>“I cannot describe how I felt when I watched this video. I could not sleep properly, I had nightmares and I feel terrified for my family back in Afghanistan.</p> <p>“This video shows the extreme violence and brutality which interpreters can face because of their work for foreign forces. These men were deliberately targeted by the Taliban,” he said.</p> <p>Rafi, 28, was blown up in 2007 whilst on patrol with the British army and suffered severe injuries. He was finally given permission to stay in Britain in 2012 after initially having his initial application rejected.</p> <p>He fled Afghanistan in 2011 after receiving death threats. His wife and three children remain there and have not been given permission to enter the UK – he has not yet held his three-year-old son.</p> <p>The high court will hear arguments on behalf of Rafi and two other Afghan interpreters that the British government’s scheme offered to locally employed staff by the British armed forces in Afghanistan is unlawful.</p> <p>Lawyers for the Afghan interpreters claim that not extending the scheme offered to Iraqis is “unlawful and discriminatory” under the Equality Act 2010, and that they should be afforded the same benefits.</p> <p>The Afghan redundancy programme offers only the chance to relocate to Britain for interpreters who worked with British forces in Helmand province for a minimum of 12 months and were employed as of December 2012.</p> <p>The hundreds who stopped work before the cut-off date but who also face death threats have to rely on a separate intimidation policy.</p> <p>This has so far deemed only one interpreter at sufficiently high risk to get a visa.</p> <p>Rosa Curling, a solicitor from Leigh Day said: “It is patently clear to us that the arrangements put in place by the UK government for these brave men, who fought alongside UK forces in Afghanistan, are completely inadequate. They do very little to protect former interpreters from the threats and attacks they are facing from the Taliban.”</p> <p>A government spokesman said it was inappropriate to comment on the footage or the legal process. “We believe that our policies are honourable, fair and legally sound,” he said. “We fully recognise the contribution made by all locally employed civilians who worked with us in Afghanistan.</p> <p>“A separate intimidation policy exists to keep current and former locally employed civilians safe in Afghanistan through a range of measures based on individual circumstances, ranging from day-to-day security advice to relocation within country. For those we judge might be in the most extreme circumstances, where there is a significant and imminent threat that cannot be mitigated in-country, we consider relocation to the UK.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9933859","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216734","internalRevision":"17","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Afghan national in UK court challenge over family’s right to join him in UK says video shows price colleagues paid for helping British","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Afghan interpreter identifies colleagues in beheading footage","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rajeev Syal","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T15:43:01Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420041392702/Afghan-men-watch-British--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gy7","wordcount":"912","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420041392702/Afghan-men-watch-British--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a41579e4b048dfa4053b0a","newspaperPageNumber":"16","internalStoryPackageCode":"83655","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T15:43:01Z","standfirst":"Afghan national in UK court challenge over family’s right to join him in UK says video shows price colleagues paid for helping British","linkText":"Afghan interpreter identifies colleagues in beheading footage","creationDate":"2014-12-31T15:25:45Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:50:04Z","internalContentCode":"454072191"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/afghan-interpreter-colleagues-beheading-footage","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/afghan-interpreter-colleagues-beheading-footage","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"b29c41c77f6cf6d8ab6adf731a62c4287f96ca9d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420041398253/Afghan-men-watch-British--011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*47083306","suppliersReference":"Del211749","altText":"Afghan men watch British soldiers with t","caption":"Afghan men watch British soldiers with the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) stand guard during a patrol on the outskirts of Kabul in 2008.

They’re there for security but nothing else. These animals, they’re nice to look at,” he says, crouching next to the small pen where his scaly pets lounge around all day and enjoy the odd dip in small ponds.</p> <p>Four crocodiles died from poisoned food that neighbours threw over the fence, perhaps remembering the beast that put Burundi on the map for wildlife as well as war 10 years ago: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_%28crocodile%29\">Gustave</a>. This 20ft-long, 2,000 pound heavy croc allegedly gorged himself on hundreds of villagers.</p> <p>National Geographic spent years searching for “the <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/news/gustave-primeval/Copy%20of%20article.html\">largest, most fabled crocodile</a> in all of Africa – a demonic Loch Ness monster of incredible proportions and, according to legend, appetite,” but Gustave vanished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ab0d78839bfb94d451d30a9999d028bf961f980\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/22/1419249064173/f503bb4a-dd9a-4494-873d-9f730f692ec2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gustave, the killer crocodile lived on a river island near Lake Tanganyika, in Burundi, and was given his name by Patrice Faye, a Frenchman.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gustave, the killer crocodile lived on a river island near Lake Tanganyika, in Burundi, and was given his name by Patrice Faye, a Frenchman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the setback, Albert’s croc stock is about to go through the roof, with up to 45 babies expected in January. So far, he has nowhere to put them, but he hopes that the land the government promised him will one day come through so that he can finally develop his wildlife park, complete with a restaurant where crocburgers are off the menu.</p> <p>“People can just eat bread and fish, like Jesus,” he says, likening his home to Noah’s Ark as he shows off his collection of cobras, chimpanzees, tortoises and monkeys that he rescues by buying from hunters.</p> <p>But even though Albert loves his current crocodiles – whose names include Josephine, Andre, Margarita and Maria – as much as his six children, if he realises his plan of breeding between 5-10,000 more, he has designs on making their relatives into belts and handbags.</p> <p>He’s never watched the Crocodile Dundee films, or seen the late broadcaster and wildlife expert Steve Irwin, but thinks “it’s not good to play with animals like crocodiles”, and learns from the South African conservationists he sees on TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34e3013732c97f2694bbdd4d713fdce40ff72cfe\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/34e3013732c97f2694bbdd4d713fdce40ff72cfe/0_110_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Albert Ngendera poses with his crocodiles at home in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, where crocodiles have been declining due to hunting for food\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Albert Ngendera poses with his crocodiles at home in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, where crocodiles have been declining due to hunting for food.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McNeish</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burundi’s president has called Albert in to discuss his dilemma, but getting land for animals in one of the most densely-populated countries on Earth is difficult.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/burundi/bujumbura/sights/nature-wildlife/musee-vivant\">Bujumbura’s Musee Vivant (‘living museum’)</a>, star-crossed crocodiles Romeo and Juliet can only gaze at one another from tiny pens to avoid the pitter patter of tiny feet, while giant Lacoste – the shirtfront emblem of any self-respecting Frenchman – may as well be embroidered for all the pool space he has to wallow in.</p> <p>The zoo relies on selling £3 guinea pigs and £7 rabbits for tourists to feed to the crocodiles to keep the place afloat.</p> <p>Albert wants to expand his ark to include lions, giraffes and tigers. He refuses to believe that Africa doesn’t have the latter, “because Tanzania has everything”. If not, he’ll settle for a leopard.</p> <p>The government lacks the funds to lock up the crocodiles, says Feruzi Mohamed, director general of Burundi’s environment ministry. “But even if we did, we wouldn’t enclose this species away from their natural habitat.”</p> <p>Mohamed is relying on a law that threatens crocodile hunters with a six-month jail term and fine. But if Burundi really wants to save its crocs, it had better make it snappy or they will be immortalised only in legends.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2213821","internalRevision":"797","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"In Burundi’s capital, Albert Ngendera has turned his home into a refuge to save the country’s declining crocodiles from being snapped up for dinner.

Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>China’s drift towards a new authoritarianism under the unsmiling leadership of Xi Jinping has found new expression in a series of alarming year’s-end moves to curb personal freedoms and free speech. The country’s implacable president and Communist party chief is forcefully driving China towards economic and geopolitical superpower status. But the social cost is mounting steadily.</p> <p>With the ruthless crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong still fresh in the memory, Xi’s latest anti-democratic coup came in the form of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/30/google-gmail-shutdown-china\" title=\"\">expanded action to block Gmail</a>, Google’s email service, presumably because it gave users a degree of autonomy that Xi and his unelected party cadres find threatening. China already regularly blocks foreign websites such as Facebook and YouTube. Google pulled most of its business out of China in 2011 after a row over censorship.</p> <p>Attempting to justify the Gmail shutdown, the Global Times, which is close to the Communist party, accused Google of failing to comply with Chinese law. But an <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1670661/chinese-internet-users-should-accept-blocking-gmail-china-claims-global\" title=\"\">editorial</a> also suggested China’s action “must have been prompted by newly emerged security reasons” including “ideological security”. It then offered some specious reassurance: “We only need to have faith that China has its own logic in terms of internet policy and it is made and runs in accordance with the country’s fundamental interests.” For many Chinese, that is a big ask.</p> <p>Aspects of Xi’s policy of “autocracy with Chinese characteristics” are familiar to the country’s academic community, which is under renewed pressure to toe the party line. Instructions issued by the president after a higher education conference on Monday included the demand that universities do more to promote Marxist doctrine and Communist party ideological guidance, the Xinhua news agency reported.</p> <p>“Enhancing [party] leadership and party-building in the higher learning institutions is a fundamental guarantee for running socialist universities with Chinese features well,” Xi was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/30/world/asia/ap-as-china-universities.html\" title=\"\">quoted as saying</a>.</p> <p>Political indoctrination is already a routine feature of university life for Chinese students, while their teachers are subject to monitoring to ensure political correctness. In an echo of the Stalinist era in the Soviet Union, this year reporters from state-controlled media were ordered to attend university lectures and detect and denounce teachers whose ideas might be considered “scornful of China” or pro-western.</p> <p>Prof Zhang Xuezhong, of East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai, and Prof Xia Yeliang, of Peking University in Beijing – both noted champions of free speech and the rule of law – were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/world/asia/chinese-professor-who-advocated-free-speech-is-fired.html\" title=\"\">sacked in 2013</a> for what they said were political reasons. “I’m just a university faculty member who expresses his own opinions, thoughts and proposals, which is absolutely my right. This is an out-and-out witch-hunt,” Zhang said.</p> <p>China’s repression of political activists, writers, independent journalists, artists and religious groups who potentially challenge the party’s monopoly of power has intensified since Xi took office nearly two years ago. In the most recent instance, on Tuesday a court <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2014/12/30/china_jails_filmmaker_of_constitution_documentary/\" title=\"\">sentenced Shen Yongping</a>, a filmmaker, to a year in jail for running an illegal business. But Shen’s supporters suggested his real offence was to have made a documentary recording the party’s ongoing failure to uphold the country’s constitution and laws.</p> <p>China’s estimated 60-70 million Christians have not escaped persecution during the Christmas period, according to reports from Beijing suggesting their plight has worsened under the new leadership. Members of Shouwang, a Beijing Christian group, <a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/no-season-goodwill-chinas-underground-christians-103632750.html\" title=\"\">told Agence France-Presse</a> that several pastors had been under house arrest since they tried to arrange Easter services in a public square in 2011.</p> <p>Most Chinese Christians shun state-run churches and worship in “house churches” beyond government control. But official tolerance of such independent activity is waning, judging by a crackdown on 400 churches in eastern Zhejiang province, some of which were reportedly demolished.</p> <p>Offering an insight into paranoid party thinking, an official recently told Beijing worshippers to “resolutely resist the use of Christianity by foreigners to infiltrate China”. Crosses have been torn down at many churches and <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/12/30/china-christianity-idINKBN0K807D20141230\" title=\"\">at a nursing home</a>. The authorities have <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/12/24/china-consumer-christmas-idINKBN0K207120141224\" title=\"\">made an issue out of Christmas lights</a>, which are increasingly popular in Chinese cities, saying they may pose a safety hazard.</p> <p>Many in China refuse to accept Xi’s self-serving prescripts about what they may and may not do or say. A recent example was provided by the Sony Pictures comedy The Interview, which caused such offence to North Korea’s dictatorship. Despite being condemned by Chinese state media, the film was gleefully (and illegally) downloaded by tens of thousands of Chinese within hours of its online release, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-slams-us-over-internet-shutdown-calls-obama-a-monkey/2014/12/27/e062ae78-8ddb-11e4-ace9-47de1af4c3eb_story.html\" title=\"\">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>“Many Chinese ‘netizens’ left positive reviews online, even without seeing the movie, as a gesture of protest against censorship, while others appeared to enjoy the lampooning of the North Korea regime. The country’s leader is often mockingly referred to by Chinese web users as ‘Fatty Kim III’,” the Post reported.</p> <p>This is exactly this sort of public irreverence, bordering on lese-majesty, that grim Xi fears most.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9933208","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216357","internalRevision":"14","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Simon Tisdall:</strong> Series of moves to curb personal freedoms and free speech demonstrate China’s drift towards a new authoritarianism","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Chinese repression of dissent intensifies under ruthless Xi Jinping","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Simon Tisdall","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-30T16:06:37Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419955471399/Xi-Jinping-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44g78","wordcount":"833","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419955471399/Xi-Jinping-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a2cb98e4b0ab1ee5e566d7","newspaperPageNumber":"22","internalStoryPackageCode":"83675","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-02T16:06:37Z","standfirst":"<p>Series of moves to curb personal freedoms and free speech demonstrate China’s drift towards a new authoritarianism</p>","linkText":"Chinese repression of dissent intensifies under ruthless Xi Jinping","creationDate":"2014-12-30T15:58:16Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:08:30Z","internalContentCode":"454039576"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/30/china-repression-dissent-xi-jinping","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/30/china-repression-dissent-xi-jinping","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"598b0912df9229b5bf2ea0187dc909891435d614","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419955476811/Xi-Jinping-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","picdarUrn":"GD*43988952","suppliersReference":"PEK102","altText":"Xi Jinping","caption":"Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.

The objective for players in D€mocracy is simple: to gain and stay in power for as long as possible. To that end, anything goes – from leaking documents that slander your opponents to shuffling inquisitive judges off politically sensitive cases to buying a media company to control the campaign coverage.</p> <p>“We wanted to show how politics works in our country,” said Carlos Martín Guevara, a 34-year-old geneticist.</p> <p>After repeated heated conversations about the investigation into a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/21/spain-mariano-rajoy-corruption-allegations\" title=\"\">secret slush fund</a> that allegedly benefited the governing People’s party, he said: “We decided we have to make a board game out of this because it seems more like a game than anything else.”</p> <p>A successful crowdfunding campaign meant it went into production in 2014.</p> <p>The resulting game plays like a scathing critique of the state of Spain’s democracy 39 years after the death of the dictator General Francisco Franco. “We still have confidence in the democratic system,” said Martín Guevara. “We’re just not in agreement with how some politicians apply democracy.”</p> <p>The game highlights the choices politicians make, with players forced to choose whether they want full transparency in their campaign finances or prefer to use undeclared donations from companies, as was alleged in the autumn when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/spanish-authorities-arrest-51-anti-corruption-sweep\" title=\"\">51 people were arrested across the country</a>. To prop up sagging popularity rates, players can start rumours about their opponents or launch a campaign to host the Olympics.</p> <p>The goal of another board game, Corruptopolis, on the other hand, is to draw attention to the scandals that have engulfed politicians of the left and right as well as businesses, trades unions and football clubs. As she watched the spreading corruption accusations, Marina Belda, a 22-year-old industrial design student, worried it was becoming easy to tune out the many scandalous headlines. “I wanted to take the situation and make a statement out of it.”</p> <p>Players are invited to take on the role of those involved in some of the most notorious scandals. Their goal is to become the most corrupt, a feat achieved by reaching the fictional city of Villa Corrupta. To progress, players have to answer questions about high-profile scandals, such as which socialist parliamentarian opened a bank account in Switzerland in 1998? Or which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/09/princess-cristina-spain-scandal-court\" title=\"\">member of the royal family</a>, entangled in an investigation for money laundering and tax fraud, repeatedly used the replies “I’m not aware,” “I don’t remember” or “I don’t know” to a judge’s questions? “If you’re playing a game, you get a little more angry. I wanted people to get angry but in a different way,” said Belda.</p> <p>With her game due to go into production soon, her biggest headache is keeping up with the headlines. In the five months since she finished the prototype, four more cases of corruption had come to the light, she said.</p> <p>Belda now keeps a folder of news clippings on corruption, in anticipation of updates to the game. The team behind D€mocracy said they’ve learned to do the same. As Guevara said: “Our politicians never stop surprising us.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9917986","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216281","internalRevision":"29","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"D€mocracy and Corruptopolis invite players to grasp for power or become the most corrupt, reflecting real-life scandals","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Power, corruption and lies inspire board games with a point in Spain","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Ashifa Kassam in Madrid","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T19:10:11Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/12/30/1419951121015/An-anti-corruption-protes-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44g4d","wordcount":"564","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/12/30/1419951121015/An-anti-corruption-protes-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a2aa1ae4b0fa04a20dbfbc","newspaperPageNumber":"21","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T19:10:11Z","standfirst":"D€mocracy and Corruptopolis invite players to grasp for power or become the most corrupt, reflecting real-life scandals","linkText":"Power, corruption and lies inspire board games with a point in Spain","creationDate":"2014-12-30T13:35:22Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:05:49Z","internalContentCode":"454034050"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/spain-corruption-scandals-inspire-board-games","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/spain-corruption-scandals-inspire-board-games","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"f9ccd702a420f4c8e8e6c61aed350b9400458177","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/12/30/1419951127372/An-anti-corruption-protes-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"REUTERS","picdarUrn":"GD*47802791","suppliersReference":"SPS06","altText":"An anti-corruption protest outside Valdemoro town hall, near Madrid, in October 2014","caption":"An anti-corruption protest in Valdemoro in October.

Photograph: Karl-Josef Hildenbrand/DPA/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Nice guys finish last, so the saying goes. There is one man, though, whose recent chart success seems to challenge that maxim. Official figures show that Ed Sheeran, who has persisted with his scruffy image and simple songwriting, was the biggest-selling artist of 2014 with his second album, X. He is Britain’s biggest export since Downton Abbey.</p> <p>Sheeran, already the most searched-for male celebrity on Google, may well see his career scale further heights in 2015, with two Grammy nominations and three nights at Wembley Stadium in July – two of which are sold out. Performing with only a backing band, loop pedal and an acoustic guitar, he is about to pull off the biggest busk of all time.</p> <p>So how did Sheeran, a relatively normal bloke, making relatively normal music, manage to become Britain’s biggest-selling artist?</p> <p>Niceness alone, of course, doesn’t account for his blockbuster success with album X; it sold 1.7m copies in 2014 in Britain, one of only two releases to beat the 1m mark, and has had over 430m streams worldwide since its release in June – more than any other artist globally. Perhaps it is more thanks to Sheeran’s skills in balancing his guise as the bastion of shabby student authenticity with the role of mercurial businessman – not to mention a fierce sense of underdog ambition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff20f1d8a5e0f73377b6aef701aeb557ddbd550f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/1/1420125294667/4678f9dc-1b6c-4488-b04e-0339371d2b2f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Sheeran poses with singers Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande and Victoria's Secret models at a London fashion show in December 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Sheeran poses with singers Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande and Victoria’s Secret models at a London fashion show in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A bit of luck helps, too. The initial spark for Sheeran’s stratospheric success can be traced back to two chance events. The first occurred during an impromptu LA trip in 2010, which led to a friendship with the actor and musician Jamie Foxx. Foxx saw Sheeran play and ended up providing him with exposure in the US on his radio show, The Foxxhole. That same year, Sheeran’s music was noticed by the web mogul Jamal Edwards, whose online channel SB.TV has shone a light on the wealth of talent emerging from the UK grime scene. The SB.TV connections led to Sheeran collaborating with established grime artists including Wiley, JME and Sway, while he simultaneously worked the grind of indie venues in London, performing 300 shows in 2010 alone.</p> <p>With opportunities opening in both the US and UK, Sheeran was able to establish fans on both sides of the Atlantic – an accomplishment many musicians are unable to crack throughout the duration of their career.</p> <p>George Ergatoudis, head of music for Radio 1 and 1Xtra, believes Sheeran’s ability to straddle a multitude of modern genres makes him stand out. “He switches between folk music and black music in a unique way … no one else channels Eminem and Damien Rice simultaneously like he can,” he says.</p> <p>Such careful cultural curation appeals to a range of ages, genres and genders, and allows Sheeran to be playlisted on Radio 1, Radio 2 and BBC 1Xtra. The latter channel named him the most powerful artist on its annual Power List – a choice that triggered controversy, given 1Xtra’s description as the “black music network”.</p> <p>As well as catering for the indie crowd and pop audiences – the singer has toured with Taylor Swift – Sheeran’s honeyed vocals and dalliance with rap styles has also helped increase his trajectory in the US, where hip hop and R&amp;B is a far more lucrative business than in Britain. This year he collaborated with rapper The Game and appeared on the cover of the influential rap magazine Vibe.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXvzzTICvJs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXvzzTICvJs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ed Sheeran - You Need Me, I Don’t Need You</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Although much rap music can be about bragging, intrinsic to Sheeran’s aesthetic is his ability to appear everyday. Material on his debut album, +, had an obsession with promoting his allegiance to reality (“Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors/Nationwide tour with Just Jack/Still had to get the bus back”), and his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edsheeran/status/539748684750409728\">Twitter feed is a constant source of disarming truths</a>, such as “doing the Victoria secrets fashion show tonight and I’m eating a Greggs sausage roll in the dressing room”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/edsheeran/statuses/539748684750409728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Doing the Victoria secrets fashion show tonight and I&#39;m eating a Greggs sausage roll in the dressing room</p>&mdash; Ed Sheeran (@edsheeran) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edsheeran/status/539748684750409728\">December 2, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Eric Clarke, professor of music at Oxford University, thinks this is a potent attribute for an artist in 2014. “His boy-next-door [image] – not very good looks but a perfectly nice guy – and the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA\">Thinking Out Loud</a>, with its reflections on getting older and fidelity and love in a fairly conventional context, is a slight counter-blast to fast-living celebrity culture.”</p> <p>This sense of self-imposed legitimacy also taps into the kind of heartfelt testimonies found on X Factor.</p> <p>According to the book Faking It: The Quest for Authenticity in Popular Music, there are three kinds of authenticity in music’s history: cultural authenticity (appearing true to your culture), personal authenticity (appearing true to yourself), and representational authenticity (not “faking it” in terms of how you record your music).</p> <p>Hugh Barker, the book’s co-author, says that cultural authenticity has become slightly less important over time as music is increasingly globalised. He says: “Personal authenticity seems to be more prized than ever. Before the late 60s, there were very few songs that directly referenced the writer’s life. That changed with songs by people like John Lennon, James Taylor, Carole King – and since that time autobiography has become ubiquitous, and is often used as a badge of authenticity.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lp-EO5I60KA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ed Sheeran – Thinking Out Loud</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A far more straightforward explanation for Sheeran’s global impact lies within his songs. Fiona Bevan, the singer-songwriter who co-wrote One Direction’s Little Things with Sheeran, pins the copyable nature of his songs on the youth market’s current captivation with him.</p> <p>She says: “Because of the fact that Ed plays solo guitar, and you can hear the acoustic guitar part on the records, the songs are accessible to people to learn to play at home. All his songs are so well written that you can strip away all the production and the songs still stand in their own right. I think the YouTube generation gravitate towards this clear, seemingly simple songwriting when they want to cover their favourite songs, and share them with their networks – so there’s this incredible surge in awareness from fans on YouTube making their own versions and spreading them far and wide.”</p> <p>To others, Sheeran’s ascent is baffling, perhaps even offensive to those who hoped that the voice of a new generation might be more revolutionary. In 2012, the influential journalist Caitlin Moran tweeted: “If my kids ever tell me they like Ed Sheeran, I’ll put them in a sack and throw them in a canal.” Sheeran’s response was to sidestep a potential social media spat by sending her “lots of hugs” via Twitter, prompting regret and a grovelling offer of drinks on the part of Moran. Which just goes to show that you never should underestimate the potency of being nice.</p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/01/uk-top-10-albums-2014-british-artists\">UK top 10 albums of 2014 are all by British artists for first time </a></li> </ul> <h2>Artist album chart 2014 </h2> <p>1 Ed Sheeran X</p> <p>2 Sam Smith In the Lonely Hour</p> <p>3 George Ezra Wanted on Voyage</p> <p>4 Paolo Nutini Caustic Love</p> <p>5 Coldplay Ghost Stories</p> <p>6 Paloma Faith A Perfect Contradiction</p> <p>7 One Direction Four</p> <p>8 Olly Murs Never Been Better</p> <p>9 Pink Floyd The Endless River</p> <p>10 Take That III</p> <h2>Most streamed artists 2014</h2> <p>1 Ed Sheeran</p> <p>2 Sam Smith</p> <p>3 Arctic Monkeys</p> <p>4 Eminem</p> <p>5 Calvin Harris</p> <p>6 Coldplay</p> <p>7 One Direction</p> <p>8 Beyoncé</p> <p>9 Katy Perry</p> <p>10 Bastille</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 January 2015.

Lawyers claim that those wrongly convicted may now only receive compensation if someone else is convicted of the crime of which they were accused.</p> <p>Victor Nealon, aged 53, a former postman, was convicted of attempted rape in Redditch in Worcestershire in 1996. He served 17 years, 10 years more than his recommended tariff, because he continued to protest his innocence.</p> <p>A year ago in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/16/wrongly-jailed-victor-nealon-free-streets-postman\">December 2013 his conviction was quashed </a>after fresh DNA evidence, taken from the blouse and underwear of the victim, pointed to “an unknown male” as responsible for the crime. But now Nealon, who came out of prison penniless, has been told that he is not entitled to any compensation, although others wrongly convicted in the past and who served similar long sentences, have been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/17/ministry-of-justice-refuses-compensation-man-wrongly-imprisoned-17-years\">declining to compensate him </a>on the grounds that his innocence has to be proved “beyond reasonable doubt”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ac3fdbfd-06aa-4af5-a7ab-dfc9e49e25c1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/1/1420103214041/32b6f0d8-fad6-423a-b186-87df680e3cad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Victor Nealon was wrongly convicted of attempted rape and served 17 years\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victor Nealon was wrongly convicted of attempted rape and served 17 years. His conviction was quashed in December 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An initial appeal against the decision through a judicial review was unsuccessful, so now Nealon’s legal team is seeking a fresh hearing in 2015 to challenge the refusal.</p> <p>“The justice department are being completely resistant to offering any compensation,” said Mark Newby, Nealon’s lawyer, who commissioned the DNA tests that led to his client’s freedom. “They are making it virtually impossible for anyone to be compensated unless someone else is convicted of the crime. The Criminal Cases Review Commission have apologised to us for the delay in taking on his case in the first place. It seems that everyone is very sorry but no one wants to compensate him.”</p> <p>An MoJ spokesperson said: “There is no automatic entitlement to compensation but every application is considered on its merits. It would be inappropriate to comment on the details of any individual’s case.”</p> <p>Nealon said he was determined to pursue the action for compensation as his life was ruined by the conviction. “I am going to keep on fighting for this,” he said. He was homeless and had only £46 to live on when he first emerged from prison.</p> <p>Applications for compensation following the quashing of convictions are currently considered under the Criminal Justice Act of 1988 and the justice secretary is responsible for deciding whether compensation is payable. Since 2008, payments have been capped at £1m in respect of cases involving detention of 10 years or more, and £500,000 in all other cases. An independent assessor decides on the exact sum.</p> <p>In 2014, the government introduced new legislation providing, for the first time, a statutory definition of what constitutes a miscarriage of justice for the purposes of determining eligibility for compensation. This definition now means that compensation is only paid where the new fact which led to the quashing of an applicant’s conviction shows beyond reasonable doubt that they did not commit the offence.</p> <p>At his appeal in 2013, Nealon’s barrister, Peter Willcock QC, argued that had the DNA evidence been provided at the original trial it would have been “explosive”. The prosecution argued that the DNA evidence was neutral as samples could have been from other sources, such as the shops where the victim bought the clothes.</p> <p>The challenge to the new compensation rules come at a time when there have been fresh developments in two other high profile cases, both involving nurses, which lawyers and campaigners claim are also miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>Last month, BBC’s Panorama programme came up with fresh medical evidence on behalf of Colin Norris, who was jailed for life in 2008 for the murders of four patients in a Leeds hospital. A juror in his trial, when shown the new evidence by the BBC, said that he would not now have voted to convict Norris.</p> <p>The case of Benjamin Geen, jailed in 2006 for 30 years for murdering two patients and seriously harming 15 others, is also coming under renewed scrutiny. His legal team is now arguing that the respiratory arrests suffered by his patients were not the “extremely rare events portrayed at his trial”. Both men claim that no murders took place and that there is a medical explanation for the deaths.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9933488","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216777","internalRevision":"20","publication":"The

Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>“Put your wallet away,” advises Tatler, the glossy magazine for the extremely well-heeled. “Sometimes, the right choice isn’t the most expensive one.”</p> <p>This is the introduction to Tatler’s second guide to the best state schools in the country. It’s hardly comprehensive. Under a headline that celebrates “freedom from feedom”, it lists just 12 primary schools, and 22 state secondaries. Nevertheless Tatler’s research found “superb heads, stupendously dedicated teachers, articulate, smartly turned-out pupils, top-notch academic results, sensational facilities …”</p> <p>And it hints at a sea-change among the rich and powerful in their education choices for their children, from private to state – a change borne out by cabinet members such as the former education secretary Michael Gove, whose daughter Beatrice attends a state secondary, and reports that David Cameron’s daughter Nancy will do the same from September.</p> <p>These days, Tatler suggests, the “smuggest mummies”, aren’t those at the gates of top prep schools, but the ones who have “snagged a place” at the best state primaries. “And,” it continues, “if you still need convincing, hear this: according to government research, pupils from comprehensive schools are likely to do better at university than children with similar A-level results who were educated at private schools.”</p> <p>It may be no coincidence that the Tatler guide is published amid continuing reports that the middle classes are being priced out of private education. It also follows an interview in the Guardian this week with Alun Jones, the new president of the Girls’ Schools Association, which represents independent girls schools, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/31/labour-class-war-private-schools\" title=\"\">in which he blames Britain’s “educational apartheid” on parents buying their way into catchment areas for the best state schools</a>, rather than private schooling.</p> <p>Among the most interesting entries on the Tatler list is William Tyndale, now the most over-subscribed primary in Islington, north London, and praised by the magazine for its “fabulous” playground and its teaching of Latin. In contrast, in the 1970s it was depicted in some quarters as “the school of shame” and its progressive teaching methods, which allowed pupils unprecedented freedoms, became the subject of a high-profile public inquiry.</p> <p>Another Islington school, Highbury Grove, is also included, with high praise for the Latin (again), the gym, the pool and a music programme backed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Yet it wasn’t always a favourite of the middle classes. Ten years ago it was featured in a controversial TV documentary that claimed to reveal poor behaviour in inner-city classrooms but was fiercely disputed by the school.</p> <p>Among other primary entries is the Fox school in west London, which was the highest-performing primary in the country for the second year running last year. It has, Tatler notes, “a catchment area that reads like an estate agent’s lust list”.</p> <p>The West London free school primary, part of the author Toby Young’s West London free school academy trust, also features. “They’re still ironing out the odd wrinkle at the senior school,” says Tatler (which included said senior school in last year’s guide). WLFS primary, it notes, has “cute pinafores for the girls” and “the ultimate bonus”: automatic transfer to the senior school at 11.</p> <p>Outside London there’s Trinity Church of England primary school on the edge of the Badminton estate, “in the heart of Beaufort Hunt country – what could be lovelier?”, where some parents turn up in their Aston Martins and an equestrian team is planned.</p> <p>Among London secondaries there’s Grey Coat Hospital school in Westminster, where Gove’s daughter is a student and which was visited by David and Samantha Cameron. It attracts 1,140 applicants for 151 places. Lady Margaret School in Fulham, rumoured to be among the Camerons’ favourites, also gets a brief mention, as does St Marylebone and Camden school for girls.</p> <p>The Cotswold School in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, is featured, with riding, shooting and philosophy on offer, plus trips to China, Nicaragua and Iceland – as is the Kings’ School, in Winchester, Hampshire, of which one parent says: “It is impossible to talk about this school without sounding smug.”</p> <p>Bishop Wordsworth’s in Salisbury, Wiltshire, alma mater of actors Ralph and Joseph Fiennes, is “the closest a state school gets to being private – just without the space”, and also featured is the interestingly named Sexey’s, a state boarding school in Bruton, Somerset, named after Hugh Sexey, royal auditor to Elizabeth I.</p> <p>Tatler’s editor, Kate Reardon, launching the guide, said: “Following the huge popularity of Tatler’s first state schools guide last year we were very excited to tackle the subject again.</p> <p>“We included a lot of new entries as there are so many great schools we wanted to highlight, however the first list very much still stands.”</p> <p>Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, was similarly enthusiastic about state schools. “What parents need to remember,” he said, “is that state schools provide an excellent and inclusive education for children and young people – regardless of whether they appear on Tatler’s list.”</p> <h2>The Tatler-approved state schools</h2> <p><strong>Primary schools</strong></p> <p>Bousfield,

Now, apart from a solitary crow that flew away as I approached, the landscape seemed lifeless and bleak.</p> <p>But then there was a sudden flurry of activity amongst the tangle of branches and briars beside the footpath, and soon I was surrounded by a flock of long-tailed tits.</p> <p>I can think of few birds so certain to lift the spirits in midwinter. They bounded along the hedge beside me in a restless flock, hyperactive acrobats, each pausing for just a second or two to search for food morsels.</p> <p>It is a wonder that such waif-like birds, seemingly just ragged bundles of grey, black and pink feathers, survive winter at all. Even if I spent an hour scrutinising twigs with a magnifying glass, I doubt that I would be able to find more than a few insect eggs and perhaps a spider or two.</p> <p>Their survival seems to depend on constant movement, spending each second of the daylight hours in a relentless search of every nook and cranny.</p> <p>They flew on ahead of me but I caught up with them again on the edge of a wood, where they were foraging in the low branches of a sycamore.</p> <p>Part of the charm of these birds is that they are so fearless when they are intent on feeding.</p> <p>There were moments when I could have reached out and touched them. I could hear the scratch of beaks and claws on tree bark and the rustle of wing feathers.</p> <p>Sometimes they dangled below branches like trapeze artists, perhaps searching for aphid eggs on buds, using their long tails as counterbalances.</p> <p>Then they were winkling something out from crevices between twigs, buffeted by wind that blew their tail plumes awry; antics that put a smile on my face. <strong>Phil Gates</strong> <em>@seymourdaily</em></p> <p>Follow Country Diary @gdncountrydiary</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934547","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216731","internalRevision":"29","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"<strong>Country diary: Wolsingham, Weardale</strong> In the lifeless landscape, a flock of long-tailed tits can lift the spirits with their antics","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"In the bleak midwinter","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Phil Gates","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-01-01T05:30:01Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420040260820/long-tailed-tit--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gy4","wordcount":"342","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420040260820/long-tailed-tit--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a414fbe4b0ab1ee5e56731","newspaperPageNumber":"34","internalStoryPackageCode":"83799","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-04T05:30:01Z","standfirst":"<strong>Wolsingham, Weardale</strong>: In the lifeless landscape, a flock of long-tailed tits can lift the spirits with their antics","linkText":"In the bleak midwinter","creationDate":"2014-12-31T15:23:39Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T08:55:06Z","internalContentCode":"454072128"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/01/country-diary-in-the-bleak-midwinter","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/01/country-diary-in-the-bleak-midwinter","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"47f80162574f00547bc855198654861ea45953f2","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420040266352/long-tailed-tit--011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*49156684","suppliersReference":"BWX73J","altText":"long-tailed tit ","caption":"A long-tailed tit (<em>Aegithalos caudatus</em>) adult, feeding, hanging from twig by one foot, in Norfolk.

Emergency services soon arrived to aid the wounded in Chen Yi Square, an area that often becomes crowded during major events. It was not immediately clear what triggered the stampede.</p> <p>The official Xinhua news agency said many of the injured were students. Photographs on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, showed densely packed crowds of revellers along the Bund, which lies on the bank of the Huangpu river. In some photographs, rescue workers were seen trying to resuscitate victims on the pavement while ambulances waited nearby.</p> <p>Authorities had shown concern about crowd control in the days leading up to New Year’s Eve. They recently cancelled an annual 3D laser show on the Bund which attracted 300,000 people last year.</p> <p>New Zealand, the first country to celebrate the new year, celebrated with fireworks launched from Auckland’s Sky Tower, while in Australia an estimated 1.5 million spectators lined the harbour to watch the now renowned firework display on Sydney Harbour Bridge. The event, broadcast to an estimated billion people, featured a tribute to the two hostages killed in the December siege inside a cafe before seven tonnes of fireworks, including 10,000 aerial explosives and 100,000 pyrotechnics, went up in smoke.</p> <p>In Indonesia, celebrations were muted because of the recent loss of AirAsia Flight 8501. In Japan, people filled temples and shrines to pray for peace as bells struck 108 times to mark the number of temptations in Buddhism.</p> <p>Dubai saw hundreds of thousands of revellers watch fireworks launch from the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building, which was wrapped with 70,000 panels to create the biggest ever illuminated LED facade. Meanwhile, a light show and fireworks marked the beginning of 2015 at the Olympic park in Beijing.</p> <p>Moscow was one of the first cities in Europe to mark the new year, with fireworks detonating over St Basil’s Cathedral and the Kremlin.</p> <p>In London, 100,000 people gathered on the banks of the Thames to watch an 11-minute firework display involving 12,000 pyrotechnics. This year’s event was ticketed for the first time, with revellers paying £10 each to access the fenced-off viewing area, after around half a million tried to squeeze into the area around the South Bank last year.</p> <p>“If you don’t have a ticket, the best place to watch the #londonnye fireworks will be live on the BBC,” the office of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, said on Twitter after telling the public that last year’s crowded conditions meant that a free event was “untenable”.</p> <p>However, he came under fire from opposition politicians over the ticketing and for the erection of mobile signs hammering home the message that the fireworks were being shown on the BBC. Fiona Twycross, a member of the London Assembly, described the signs as an insult to Londoners and visitors to the city and accused the mayor of privatising New Year by bringing in the ticketing system.</p> <p>Those who bought tickets, however, described the atmosphere as “electric”.</p> <p>In Scotland, Hogmanay celebrations on Stirling Castle’s esplanade were cancelled due to high winds. A live outdoor concert had been due to take place on the esplanade, with music from The Waterboys, Skerryvore, JJ Gilmour and Model Aeroplanes, followed by a fireworks display. However, the event was cancelled as high winds meant public safety could not be guaranteed, police said.</p> <p>Chief Inspector Paul Rollo, Stirling policing commander, said: “Hogmanay is one of the highlights of the year in the city, and the joint decision to cancel the street party was only taken after lengthy discussion and deliberation with the organisers.</p> <p>“We prioritise the safety of people attending an event and with the poor weather conditions right now with winds far stronger than expected, unfortunately this could not be assured.”</p> <p>Up to 75,000 people were expected to gather for the world-famous event in Edinburgh, which saw Lily Allen headlining the Concert in the Gardens. There were five live stages throughout the city, with 13 acts performing, including Soul II Soul and Twin Atlantic, plus four firework displays.</p> <p>Early celebrations included a torchlight parade when a cast of thousands carried flaming torches through the historic Old Town. Organisers said tickets for events have been bought by those in more than 70 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Mauritius, Slovakia and South Africa.</p> <p>Wilson Peery, 33, from Oregon, USA, travelled to Scotland especially to attend Edinburgh’s street party. He said: “I came here in 2008 and made a split second decision to come back this year with a group of friends.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Lady (Elizabeth) Butler-Sloss, the high court judge forced to stand down as chair of the government child abuse inquiry, has been criticised for suggesting survivors could cause problems with the investigation.</p> <p>Peter Saunders, the chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac), hit back after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/31/butler-sloss-victims-not-run-child-abuse-inquiry\" title=\"\">Butler-Sloss warned it would be difficult to find a chair</a> for the inquiry who was sufficiently removed from the establishment to satisfy victims’ groups. Both Butler-Sloss and the City lawyer Dame Fiona Woolf resigned from the role after survivors of abuse objected to their links to senior Westminster politicians.</p> <p>Saunders said Butler-Sloss was wrong to imply survivors were holding the government hostage over the selection of the chair, when it was the Home Office that had made two bad choices.</p> <p>Survivor groups just wanted to get to the truth and for the process to be overseen by an appropriate candidate with no conflicts of interest, he said.</p> <p>Butler-Sloss stepped down in July because her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, had been attorney general in the 1980s and his actions would have been subject to investigation by the inquiry. Her successor, Woolf, was also forced to resign because she was a friend and neighbour of Leon Brittan, who was home secretary at the time of the alleged child abuse.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, Butler-Sloss said she worried that “the victims and survivors, for whom I have the most enormous sympathy – and as a judge I tried a great many child abuse cases – for them to be deciding who should be the person chairing it creates real problems”.</p> <p>She suggested that anyone qualified to chair such an inquiry would have experience that would lead them to be branded as being part of the establishment.</p> <p>“If you do not have in the past a position of authority, how are you going to be able to run the inquiry? You are going to need someone who knows how to run things and if you get someone with an obscure background with no background of establishment, they will find it very difficult and may not be able to produce the goods.”</p> <p>She said the normal processes of sifting of evidence and neutrality between accuser and accused might go by the board if the victims were allowed to dominate.</p> <p>“Of course the victims are at the centre of this, as [the home secretary] Theresa May said – it is hugely to her credit that she wanted this inquiry – but if the victims are to run it, then there will be real difficulties.”</p> <p>Saunders said the problem was not that Butler-Sloss and Woolf were members of the establishment but that they had inappropriately close connections to politicians whose actions were likely to be scrutinised by the inquiry.</p> <p>“Butler-Sloss mentioned something about it inevitably going to be an establishment-type figure. I don’t think we have a problem with that. It is simply that they should do their due diligence before appointing someone … Theresa May, at the end of the day, will make the decision. She is not stupid and would do worse than to run it past the people at the heart of the thing …</p> <p>“Butler-Sloss is being unfair to imply the Home Office is being held hostage by us. We want to help. All survivors want is to get to the truth.”</p> <p>The shadow Home Office minister Diana Johnson also criticised Butler-Sloss’s comments, made on Wednesday as guest editor on the Today programme.</p> <p>“Those with authority to run CSA inquiry do not only come from judiciary and establishment. Very concerned by narrow thinking of Butler-Sloss,” Johnson tweeted.</p> <p>Butler-Sloss’s resignation statement said: “It has become apparent over the last few days … that there is a widespread perception, particularly among victim and survivor groups, that I am not the right person to chair the inquiry. It has also become clear to me that I did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties.</p> <p>“This is a victim-orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government. Having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of MPs and the media, I have come to the conclusion that I should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the home secretary.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935683","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216691","internalRevision":"22","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"High court judge who was forced to quit as inquiry chair is wrong to imply victims are holding up replacement, says group","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Victims tell Butler-Sloss: don’t blame us for child abuse inquiry mistakes","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rowena Mason, political correspondent","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T14:25:10Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035596815/Napac-chief-Peter-Saunder-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gjt","wordcount":"741","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035596815/Napac-chief-Peter-Saunder-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a40532e4b084424a7b2e72","newspaperPageNumber":"14","internalStoryPackageCode":"83628","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T14:25:11Z","standfirst":"High court judge who was forced to quit as inquiry chair is wrong to imply victims are holding up replacement, says group","linkText":"Victims tell Butler-Sloss: don’t blame us for child abuse inquiry mistakes","creationDate":"2014-12-31T14:16:18Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:25:03Z","internalContentCode":"454069973"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/31/victims-butler-sloss-child-abuse-inquiry-mistakes","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2014/dec/31/victims-butler-sloss-child-abuse-inquiry-mistakes","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"f7104cd13edef520ef5efebeb9f64da1db790f6a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035603384/Napac-chief-Peter-Saunder-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"PA","picdarUrn":"GD*47890497","suppliersReference":"POLITICS_Abuse_143836.JPG","altText":"Napac chief Peter Saunders (2nd right) with child sex abuse victims' representatives","caption":"Napac chief Peter Saunders (2nd right) with victims’ representatives after they called for Fiona Woolf to quit as chair of the inquiry.

It’s time their pay came out of the stratosphere and back to planet Earth. Let us make 2015 the year in which employees get a voice on remuneration committees.”</p> <p>Information on City pay has become available since the bailout of the banking sector which prompted the European Union to demand disclosures on bonuses and the salaries of so-called “code staff” – those deemed to be taking and managing risks. The most recent data compiled from 13 employers is for 2013 and does not include the period since those employees have come under the EU cap on bonuses, which restricts payouts to one times salary or twice if shareholders approve.</p> <p>The calculations by Reuters show large variations in pay among the 13 banks included in its survey of 2,600 employees. The £3m average of Goldman Sachs’ top staff compares with £1.4m at Barclays and £600,000 at Royal Bank of Scotland – which is 79%-owned by taxpayers.</p> <p>Campaigners for a transaction tax to be paid by banks said the data showed they were not making a contribution to society.</p> <p>“Even in a financial sector with grossly inflated pay, Goldman Sachs manages to shock with what it gives its top brass. But Goldmans is the tip of the iceberg – an under-taxed financial sector continues filling the pockets of its own in a way that is out of proportion to the contribution it makes to society,” a spokesman for the Robin Hood tax campaign said.</p> <p>The first year that information about pay was required was 2010, when Goldman Sachs’ average was £4m before it dipped to £1.8m and then started to rise again.</p> <p>The EU bonus cap, introduced at the start of 2014, has resulted in banks devising controversial allowances to prevent their top bankers losing out, handed out in addition to regular pay and bonuses. In 2014,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/26/banks-30m-bonus-cap-hsbc-barclays-lloyds-rbs-shares-eu\" title=\"\"> Britain’s four high street banks handed out £30m </a>in shares to a dozen or so of their top bankers – but it is not yet clear how Wall Street players have altered the pay of their London-based staff. Ross McEwan, the boss of RBS, was the single UK bank boss not to take an allowance last year, though he will take an allowance of £1m in shares for 2015.</p> <p>There may be further changes to pay deals for bankers in 2015 as the European Banking Authority – the pan-EU banking regulator – has concluded that the allowances breach the bonus cap. The Bank of England is opposed to the cap on bonuses and has so far agreed to the payouts of allowances, though the Bank governor, Mark Carney <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/17/banking-culture-overhaul-mark-carney-bankers-pay\" title=\"\">has raised the idea that salaries could be docked </a>as a punishment for misconduct.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935107","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216634","internalRevision":"22","publication":"The

Based on his findings, the judge can then choose to uphold the original verdict, throw the case out, or send it to retrial, in which case he must also decide whether to release them on bail.</p> <p>The parents of one of the three, the former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, said they were tempering their expectations. “We have very high hopes for the [hearing], but our expectations are modest,” said Juris and Lois Greste, who were allowed to visit their son in jail on Christmas Day. “We have approached landmark dates expecting a positive change, only to be bitterly disappointed.”</p> <p>Greste, the former CNN reporter Mohamed Fahmy, and local producer Baher Mohamed were initially <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/23/al-jazeera-journalists-sentences-international-condemnation-egypt\" title=\"\">jailed last June</a> on charges of abetting terrorists, spreading false news and endangering national security. The move was a prominent episode in an ongoing crackdown on all forms of domestic opposition. But it was also seen as part of a wider diplomatic spat between Egypt and Qatar, the owners of al-Jazeera and the funders of Egypt’s Islamist opposition, the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>Internationally, the case was viewed as a trumped-up attack on freedom of expression, with the court proceedings <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/24/six-flaws-case-against-three-jailed-al-jazeera-journalists-greste-fahmy-mohamed\" title=\"\">considered comically flawed</a> and politicised. But in Egypt, where the coverage on al-Jazeera’s Arabic sister channels strongly favours the brotherhood, many government supporters saw the journalists as a legitimate target.</p> <p>Since the verdict, Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has several times expressed regret that the journalists were jailed rather than deported, and in November <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/13/egypt-decree-jailed-al-jazeera-journalist-peter-greste\" title=\"\">issued a new law</a> that would technically allow him to deport Greste, who is an Australian citizen, and possibly Fahmy, a dual Canadian-Egyptian national. But fearing a backlash among his supporters, he has not yet shown strong intent to use the law, or to issue a pardon.</p> <p>Officials have privately indicated that he will wait until at least the conclusion of the appeal before taking any decisions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3abf8ae18b7f293690e318e7067e6bac97233957\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/30/1419961895068/eb4dcd60-5621-493e-8131-2c9fd09b98d4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A protest in support of the al-Jazeera journalists outside Egypt’s embassy in London.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in support of the al-Jazeera journalists outside Egypt’s embassy in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the six months since the verdict, the three defendants have followed different paths to fight their incarceration. Greste and Mohamed, and their families, continue to frame the case as one that purely relates to press freedom.</p> <p>“The noise you all have been making,” Greste wrote in a Christmas message to his supporters, “sends a clear and unequivocal message to politicians around the world: a free press is an indivisible part of a free society.”</p> <p>By contrast, Fahmy has positioned himself as a pawn in the battle between Egypt and Qatar, rather than simply the victim of a media crackdown. He has distanced himself from al-Jazeera, issuing messages from jail that condemned the coverage of the network’s Arabic channels, and also criticised al-Jazeera for placing its journalists in danger before their arrest and for failing to secure them better lawyers. He is expected to amplify these claims during the appeal session.</p> <p>“If the judge looks past our affiliation with al-Jazeera and Qatar, and judges us as journalists who have committed no crime, then we may be freed,” he said in a message to the Guardian delivered from prison by his family. “If he considers us agents of al-Jazeera Mubasher Misr [the network’s Egyptian affiliate] … then we may face a lengthy retrial.”</p> <p>Fahmy is <a href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/fjflds\" title=\"\">now paying for his own legal team</a> without money from al-Jazeera. International rights lawyer Amal Clooney is giving pro-bono advice and sending a representative to Thursday’s hearing.</p> <p>Reporters Without Borders revealed in December that Egypt is the <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/files/bilan-2014-EN.pdf#page=1\" title=\"\">fourth-biggest jailer of journalists </a>in the world, imprisoning 16 in 2014 – 9% of the global total. The government has arrested at least 16,000 political detainees in the past 18 months, by its own figures. Independent estimates suggest the figure is closer to 40,000.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9905584","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216411","internalRevision":"50","publication":"The

Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Childcare costs have reached almost half of the average salary in some areas of the country, an analysis by the Labour party has found.</p> <p>Data collected from local councils found steep increases in the average costs of a 25-hour per week nursery place, with particularly high charges in London and the south-east. The highest figures quoted were in Bexley, south London, at £195 a week, and the highly marginal seat of Thurrock, Essex, at £185 a week.</p> <p>Childminder costs have also soared, with rates increasing particularly steeply in London – by more than £35 a week since 2010 in Croydon and Harrow. The highest weekly costs for childminders outside the City of London were said to be £200 a week in Barnet and £172.50 in Bexley.</p> <p>Overall, the cost of part-time childcare is now at least £100 a week in more than three-quarters of local authorities, Labour found through freedom of information requests. The party said this meant that in the vast majority of local areas, families were spending a quarter or more of their average weekly earnings on childcare.</p> <p>Alison McGovern, shadow minister for childcare, said the higher costs came at a time of fewer places and reduced government support.</p> <p>“Labour gets that increased help with childcare is good for families and good for the economy,” she said. “We would extend free childcare for three- and four-year-olds with parents in work from 15 to 25 hours, worth £1,500 per child, per year. We would also introduce a legal guarantee of childcare from 8am to 6pm, for parents of primary-aged children, helping families to balance work and family life.”</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, is intending to go into the election arguing that his party will best help families deal with the rising cost of living. Childcare is likely to be a big battleground issue, as the coalition parties have pushed through legislation to provide a discount of up to £2,000 per year per child, while Labour has pledged to extend the amount of free childcare for younger children.</p> <p>This week, a survey by the insurer Aviva found thousands of parents are in effect working for zero pay because of the high cost of childcare.</p> <p>This biannual report into family finances found that one in 10 working families with young children has an earner who brings home nothing after commuting, childcare and other work-associated expenses.</p> <p>The study also shows that one in four families include one parent who brings home less than £100 a month after costs, while 4% of women surveyed said they were actually paying to work because their costs were greater than their income .</p> <p>A separate report by employment consultancy The Jobs Economist highlighted the squeeze on some family incomes. It said the overall outlook for Britain’s jobs market in 2015 was the rosiest since 2007, but inequality in pay would increase as many people remained desperate for work.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936091","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216791","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Local council data shows cost of 25-hour per week nursery place has risen with some parents bringing home nothing after childcare costs","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Childcare costs nearly half the average salary – Labour analysis","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rowena Mason, political correspondent","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-01-01T00:05:05Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420046752996/Student-finger-painting-i-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gna","wordcount":"494","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420046752996/Student-finger-painting-i-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a430efe4b084424a7b2e99","newspaperPageNumber":"10","internalStoryPackageCode":"84644","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-04T00:05:05Z","standfirst":"Local council data shows cost of 25-hour per week nursery place has risen with some parents bringing home nothing after childcare costs","linkText":"Childcare costs nearly half the average salary – Labour analysis","creationDate":"2014-12-31T17:22:55Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:05:05Z","internalContentCode":"454075414"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jan/01/childcare-costs-nearly-half-average-salary-labour-analysis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/money/2015/jan/01/childcare-costs-nearly-half-average-salary-labour-analysis","sectionName":"Money","elements":[{"id":"cd076f8388c696dafb6a5e818459da11f76401a6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420046758919/Student-finger-painting-i-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*47682480","suppliersReference":"E597E7","altText":"Student finger painting in class","caption":"Overall, the cost of part-time childcare is now at least £100 a week in more than three-quarters of local authorities.

Council tax rates are based on 1991 valuations, and those in the highest-banded properties are limited to paying no more than three times the tax of those in the lowest. The pretext for deferring revaluation – that it would increase most people’s council tax – is erroneous if the revaluation is fiscally neutral overall locally. Therefore a revaluation of itself must not affect a council’s income. If nothing is done, there is a risk that the whole system will eventually collapse. The government has to legislate to revalue domestic properties every five years. With up-to-date valuations, devolved authorities can introduce a new band with the appropriate properties in it. Doing so would increase fairness in the distribution of the tax burden locally.</p> <p>With the growing demand for the devolution of tax-raising powers to local authorities in England, the council tax should, in the next parliament, I hope, be overhauled and handed back to the control of local politicians.<br /><strong>Clive Betts MP</strong><br /><em>Chair, communities and local government committee</em></p> <p>• It is not only Scotland that has been used as a testing ground for government policies (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/30/downing-street-files-oliver-letwin-poll-tax\" title=\"\">Downing street files reveal how Letwin kept poll tax plans alive</a>, 30 December). Properties in Wales were revalued in 2005, which led to 40% of properties being moved up one or two council tax bands and higher tax bills. Revaluation of English properties has never been implemented. In ruling out an English revaluation, communities and local government minister Eric Pickles said it would put up to £320 on the average council tax bill for English households. In this election year, no party would dare to even suggest, never mind implement, such a policy.

Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The word “volatile” could have been coined to describe the stock market in 2014. Early in the year we were dusting off the record books as the FTSE 100 – supported by central banks keeping the money taps turned on to boost flagging economies – came within 52 points of the peak achieved in December 1999 at the time of the dotcom boom.</p> <p>But the London index, weighed down as it is with commodity companies dependent on global growth and energy companies affected by the oil price, never did hit that peak as fears of a slowdown grew during the year. The strength of sterling hitting companies’ overseas earnings was another factor holding it back.</p> <p>Other markets with more varied constituents – notably America’s S&amp;P 500 and Germany’s Dax – continued to set new records and defy bad news. Even so, as the year progressed, that bad news seemed to mount up. Central banks started cutting back their support – entirely in the case of the US Federal Reserve’s bond buying programme – and talk of interest rate rises began to be heard. On top of that, there were doubts over the Chinese economy, the eurozone crisis re-emerged with political upheaval in Greece, while investors also had to contend with a plunge in the oil price and a rouble crisis in Russia, all of which combined to send UK shares to new lows for the year in December.</p> <p>With a late, albeit unconvincing, Christmas rally, the FTSE 100 closed at 6566.09, still down 2.7% on the year, its first annual loss since 2011. And for the first time since 2002, the index failed to gain ground during December.</p> <p>So what of our tips for 2014? With the FTSE 100 in decline, we managed a very creditable 2.3% gain on the year.</p> <p>It was the US that really did us proud, with Apple and the US medical equipment firm Stryker striding ahead and outperforming even a buoyant Dow Jones industrial average and S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>America was also helpful for another good performer, the building materials group Wolseley, which does a large chunk of its business across the Atlantic.</p> <p>Budget airline Flybe had a late run, benefiting from cheaper fuel costs in the wake of the oil price decline, while the recruitment group Hays did well in its key areas of Britain, Australia and Germany.</p> <p>But there were some less successful picks, notably Salamander Energy which fell back after disappointing exploration results in south-east Asia. This left it open to an opportunistic low priced bid, which Ophir Energy seems to have won after Spanish rival Cepsa pulled out of the running.</p> <p>Sportech was also a bad bet, which fell foul of a poor performance in its US racing business and a ruling it had to repay £93m to HMRC relating to a VAT dispute on Spot the Ball games. It plans to appeal.</p> <p>As a reminder, the 12-month period we use for these tips is an arbitrary time period for tracking a share price. In the real world, investors would be likely to cash in any gains – or take any losses – at different times of the year, rather than wait until 31 December. With that in mind, here are our picks for 2015, which range from FTSE 100 stalwarts to a few lesser known businesses with growth potential.</p> <h2><strong>Simon Goodley</strong></h2> <p>City analysts spend all year feeding numbers into spreadsheets and routinely fail to outperform the market. So, if all that effort struggles to unearth winners, maybe humble retail investors are better served trying a different approach. On that basis, the pub group JD Wetherspoon, now 820p, might get the nod in 2015. Not on the basis of a rigorous analysis of its business – although it plans 200 new pubs including an ambitious expansion in Ireland – but purely as a punt on its chairman and founder, Tim Martin. He knows the trade backwards and, more pleasingly, he can’t stand financiers (the feeling is mutual). That doesn’t mean the shares will go up every year, but simply backing Martin probably gives you as good a chance of a profit as siding with the pros.</p> <h2><strong>Juliette Garside</strong></h2> <p>CityFibre listed on Aim in January 2014. The pint-sized infrastructure company has a big ambition: building fibre optics into commercial and residential areas underserved by BT’s superfast network. It also has big allies – Sky and TalkTalk are funding fibre to the home pilot in York. If it proves economical, the plan is to extend the scheme to Britain’s 50 or so second-tier cities. With Vodafone waiting in the wings to join the scheme, CityFibre could be heading for rapid expansion. The shares, listed at 60p, have risen to more than 80p, so the current 63p price is a buying opportunity.</p> <h2><strong>Sean Farrell</strong></h2> <p>B&amp;M European’s shares haven’t caught fire since July’s flotation and sit at 285p. But 2015 could be the year the discount general retailer demonstrates its worth. Like Aldi and Lidl, B&amp;M has gained from squeezed household budgets and the rise of bargain hunting. The Liverpool-based group has about 400 stores but hardly any in the south of England. It has ambitious plans to put that right through a new store programme that is ahead of schedule. B&amp;M, chaired by former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, is also expanding in Germany, home to some of Europe’s most frugal shoppers.</p> <h2><strong>Terry Macalister</strong></h2> <p>Anyone looking for an investment with a clear conscience could support the appropriately-named Good Energy. The Wiltshire-based firm, which generates all its electricity from renewables, has seen a surge in retail customers who have been leaving the big six suppliers. Good Energy profits more than doubled last year and yet the business remains relatively small with plenty of scope for growth. The share price doubled in value in 2103 but has tumbled since, alongside falling oil and other energy prices. At their current level of 211p there should be scope for a rebound.</p> <h2><strong>Julia Kollewe</strong></h2> <p>AstraZeneca has had an exciting year: the UK pharmaceutical firm successfully fought off Pfizer’s advances in May and spent the rest of the year under the shadow of a potential new bid, which never materialised. AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot trumpeted the company’s drug pipeline and was able to boast of some early successes. While his long-term goals look ambitious, the firm “looks completely different than two years ago”, according to Morgan Stanley. Some of this is already in the share price, now 4555.5p, but we reckon the stock has further to go.</p> <h2><strong>Gwyn Topham</strong></h2> <p>How much higher can airlines’ stock climb? EasyJet, Ryanair and International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, are trading at two or three times their value from two years ago. All will be further boosted by the sudden drop in fuel prices, the biggest fixed cost that has cut margins in the last few years. While investors show signs of believing easyJet’s price has peaked, IAG, at 486.1p, could still go up. The apparent newfound stability at Iberia, steady profits at BA, the addition of Vueling – as well as the potential acquisition of Aer Lingus to secure more lucrative transatlantic business – give the group a solid look and have quietened for now the sceptics of the consolidation strategy.</p> <h2><strong>Zoe Wood</strong></h2> <p>AO World arrived on the stock exchange with a bang in February. But that first day pop, when the shares rocketed 45% above its 285p debut, was shortlived and the stock now treads water below the float price at 280.2p. The air may have leaked out of internet stocks but ao.com still offers a slice of some interesting retail action. It has slick logistics and the scope to expand from its mainstay of white goods into TVs and beyond. It also has ambition by the truckload thanks to driven founder John Roberts with the recent push into Germany appearing well thought through.</p> <h2><strong>Sarah Butler</strong></h2> <p>The hot summer was a boon for fashion retailers but they have suffered as the balmy temperatures continued into the autumn and winter, hitting sales in a much more significant trading period. With that in mind, tipping a fashion retailer may seem unwise. Discounts on coats and knitwear are everywhere and few will escape unscathed. But Boohoo, which joined the junior Aim market this summer, has all the hallmarks of a business which can outshine its peers.</p> <p>Boohoo is a fairly young business with plenty of opportunity to expand in the UK, as well as abroad. The share price has suffered by association with online fashion store Asos, which has suffered from an array of problems, some of which were self-generated. Boohoo will have to deal with the impact of the rising value of the pound on its overseas business, but its shares are still loitering well below its float price at 39.5p. That seems like an oversight as we head towards potentially easier times for UK consumers.</p> <h2><strong>Jill Treanor</strong></h2> <p>Aviva had a rocky end to 2014. It secured a deal which made it the biggest insurance, savings and asset management company in Britain by buying Friends Life but in the process dented its own stock market value, with its shares now at 484.5p. There are lots of reasons to be cautious about the share market in 2015; the general election leaves many sectors vulnerable. George Osborne sent shockwaves through the insurance sector in 2014 with plans to overhaul the pensions market and no longer make it compulsory to buy an annuity.</p> <p>With the proviso that the insurance market could again become the focus for politicians, Aviva may recover lost ground if investors conclude that the Friends deal is not as awful as it first appeared and have confidence that the enlarged insurer will be able ratchet up its dividend payouts.</p> <h2><strong>Nick Fletcher</strong></h2> <p>Software Radio Technology supplies technology and products to track marine vessels around the globe, using the International Marine Organisation’s AIS standard. It has about 95% of this market, and part of its growth has come from governments mandating ship owners to use tracking equipment.</p> <p>A key market will be the US, and the country’s coastguard is due to publish a final ruling on using AIS in January, which means more than 40,000 boats would be required to install new equipment within a few months. This could be worth $35m (£23m) in revenues to a business that has annual sales of around £6m. With other projects under way, including tracking national fishing fleets in Malaysia and India and further out, Russia and South America, SRT should see a less lumpy ordering pattern in future.</p> <p>The shares at 30.87p have shown a recent rise in anticipation of the US ruling, but could have further to go.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9894903","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216847","internalRevision":"7","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Guardian business writers outperformed the FTSE 100 with their share tips for 2014.

He was held on suspicion of a breach of the peace and later freed without charge after more than five hours in police custody.</p> <p>As he retrieved the drone on Wednesday, Surrey police released a statement saying that the arrest was made following complaints from local residents and others in the vicinity of the incident in which a woman and two young children died.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Antony Archibald said that concerns about the behaviour of a man were raised to officers from people who believed he was acting in a disrespectful and intrusive manner.</p> <p>He added: “At the time of the arrest, the main focus for officers and fire crew at the scene was to conclude the initial forensic investigation and to allow the dignified removal of the bodies of those who had sadly died.”</p> <p>However, the photojournalist responded by saying that after his arrest, police took him to the camp site where the fire took place and “paraded” him around for 25 minutes.</p> <p>“I find it a bit hypocritical for the police to suggest that I was being intrustive,” said Mitchell, who is one of the few journalists with approval from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to commercially operate Small Unmanned Aircraft (SUA)Mitchell said he did not need to alert air traffic control as he was operating a drone weighing under 7kg. “The drone was up for about five minutes and then the cops decided to snatch the controller from me.</p> <p>“It was an incredibly dangerous thing that they did. They didn’t know the dangers that they were putting myself, themselves and passing air traffic in.</p> <p>“It could have flown off in any direction. They were passing the controller between themselves and eventually got it down with a thud.”</p> <p>Mitchell predicted that the debate around drone use in general and, in particular, the approach taken by the police towards their use by journalists would continue to come into focus after a Christmas in which thousands were sold.</p> <p>“It’s ironic because I happened to have been in a meeting with senior police officers the other day and they said that they thought that using a drone was one of the more sympathetic and non-intrusive ways of getting pictures,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s been reported that 20,000 drones were sold over Christmas so there are going to be ongoing problems.

The reason for this was simple: Stalin allowed churches to reopen during the second world war; Nikita Khrushchev systematically closed them between 1959 and 1964. The man who first exposed the enormity of this persecution was Father Gleb Yakunin, who has died aged 80.</p> <p>In 1965, with a colleague, Father Nikolai Eshliman, he wrote two lengthy and detailed open letters, one to the Soviet government, the other to Patriarch Alexy I, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, setting out the nature of the anti-religious campaign in precise detail and furnished with hundreds of examples. They wrote: “The mass closure of churches, a campaign instigated from above, has created an atmosphere of anti-religious fanaticism which has led to the barbaric destruction of a large number of superb and unique works of art.”</p> <p>These words resounded around the world and undoubtedly persuaded Khrushchev’s successors to discontinue the church closures. Yakunin, however, became an isolated figure. The punishment meted out to him came not from the KGB, but from Patriarch Alexy (doubtless at the state’s instigation): he was commanded to keep silence and not to exercise his priesthood for the next 10 years. The young priest obeyed the injunction to the letter.</p> <p>Yakunin was born into a Christian family in Moscow. His father was a musician who played the clarinet in a symphony orchestra; his mother worked at the post office. Gleb lost his faith aged 15, but while studying for a degree in biology in Irkutsk, Siberia, he found it again under the influence of Alexander Men, who was to become the foremost theologian of his generation. Their subsequent careers were divergent, yet equally influential. Barred from entry to one of the few functioning seminaries, they took correspondence courses in theology and studied privately. Men served discreetly in a parish and always deflected attention from his teaching ministry, becoming a national figure only during the Gorbachev era and until his murder in 1990; Yakunin early adopted a stance of open defiance to Soviet atheism.</p> <p>His decade of silence only persuaded Yakunin to speak out more bravely when it ended in 1976. He had noted the signing of the Helsinki Agreement in 1975, which put human rights and religious liberty firmly on the international agenda. The Soviet authorities began systematically to imprison democratic activists, to which Yakunin responded by establishing a Christian Committee for the Defence of Believers’ Rights. He sent an appeal to the Fifth General Assembly of the World Council of Churches that met in Nairobi, begging the worldwide ecumenical fellowship to act on behalf of the persecuted church. The African editors of the assembly’s daily newspaper evaded the censorship which the Russian delegates exercised and caused a furore by printing the text of Yakunin’s appeal, only for the organisers to turn their face away from the issue under pressure from the Moscow Patriarchate.</p> <p>Wrongly thinking that he now had world Christian opinion behind him, Yakunin increased his efforts. His energy was prodigious. He collected more than 400 appeals from almost all Christian denominations in the Soviet Union and even included support for Jews and Muslims in his wide-ranging activities. This time the Soviet authorities themselves acted, and arrested Yakunin on 1 November 1979. At his subsequent trial, he received a sentence of 10 years, the first half to be served in a camp, the second in exile. Eight years into this, with Gorbachev at the height of his perestroika policy, Yakunin was released.</p> <p>The next year, 1988, saw celebrations marking the millennium of the conversion of the Eastern Slavs. During these June weeks Yakunin and his wife, Iraida, whom he had married in 1961, held open house for religious dissidents, inviting foreign Christian leaders in Moscow for the events to visit his flat and learn the real truth about the persecution of the past 60 years, not the sanitised version as presented by the Moscow Patriarchate. The atmosphere in the flat was electric as a succession of victims of persecution told their stories.</p> <p>Yakunin at this point might have expected a triumphal reinstatement into the senior ranks of the Russian church, or an award of the Nobel peace prize, but neither was forthcoming. Soon he began to follow a more overtly political line and was elected to the Duma, the parliament, representing the Democratic Russia party. In this role he had brief and restricted access to the state archives. Here he found in the records of the Council for Religious Affairs, the body that controlled the life of the church, incontrovertible evidence that exposed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/feb/12/1\" title=\"\">collaboration of church leaders with the KGB</a>, including that of Patriarch Alexy II, who was in office at the time.</p> <p>He was not permitted to take photocopies, but made handwritten notes, which he subsequently copied and passed to Jane Ellis, a researcher at Keston College, Kent, who published them in its journal Religion in Communist Lands. This was a bridge too far for the Moscow Patriarchate, which wrought vengeance on Yakunin by defrocking him, on the grounds that clergy were not permitted to stand for election to political office.</p> <p>As the Moscow Patriarchate regained its leading position in Russian society, Yakunin’s influence declined. He became a priest in the independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church, later transferring to the True Orthodox Church (which had its origin in the Catacomb Church of the 1930s). He continued to speak out on human rights issues.</p> <p>Mental toughness predominated in his personal relationships, but he relaxed with friends and, when able to travel in 1989, enjoyed playing truant from a conference in Manila to go white-water rafting.</p> <p>He is survived by Iraida, and their three children, Maria, Alexander and Anna.</p> <p>• Gleb Pavlovich Yakunin, priest, born 4 March 1934; died 25 December 2014</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9932139","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216287","internalRevision":"17","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Priest in the Russian Orthodox Church who campaigned on human rights issues","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Father Gleb Yakunin obituary","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Michael Bourdeaux","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-30T16:04:13Z","liveBloggingNow":"false","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e9e5f7929b6a79ff9eed95c745bd4790ac83e4a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/12/30/1419947749248/Father-Gleb-Yakunin-Russi-004.jpg\" alt=\"Father Gleb Yakunin, Russian Orthodox priest, who has died aged 80\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Father Gleb Yakunin, deputy chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet Parliamentary Committee for the Freedom of Conscience, speaking at a rally in 1990.

About 13 of the passengers went on holiday as crew companions and obviously that original crew weren’t travelling any more.”</p> <p>The spokeswoman said it was standard procedure for a new crew to operate a flight if there is an incident or delay.</p> <p>Hundreds of passengers had applauded in relief after Williams returned their airliner to base safely on Monday following an unconventional journey that included dumping fuel at sea and flying low over the Gatwick control tower twice so that air traffic controllers could scrutinise the main undercarriage with binoculars.</p> <p>The runway at Britain’s second largest airport was closed for several hours, with incoming flights diverted to alternative airports and departing aircraft delayed as the drama affected the travel plans of thousands of passengers.</p> <p>Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic president, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/549617557129687040\" title=\"\">said on Twitter</a>: “Well done VirginAtlantic pilots &amp; team for safe &amp; skillful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers &amp; crew, thanks for support &amp; patience.”</p> <p>The 447 passengers were taken to the Hilton hotel at Gatwick overnight before they took off again.</p> <p>Describing the mood on the plane on Monday, one passenger said it was “anxious, a lot were worried, some crying”.</p> <p>Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, added: “The mood was quiet and [we were] just waiting for the captain’s next announcement.”</p> <p>The passengers’ ordeal began four hours before the emergency landing, when Flight VS43 left for Las Vegas at 11.44am with 447 passengers and 15 crew on board. However, it hit problems before it reached the edge of UK airspace.</p> <p>Williams identified a problem with the landing gear, a technical issue that meant one of the five wheel sets would not descend. Instead of completing its transatlantic journey, the plane would, he announced, be turning back.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935207","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216622","internalRevision":"17","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"David Williams speaks for first time since landing airliner with 447 passengers on board following problems with landing gear","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Pilot hailed for Gatwick emergency landing says he was just doing his job","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Ben Quinn","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T12:18:56.578Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420028234085/Passengers-disembark-the--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gh3","wordcount":"606","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420028234085/Passengers-disembark-the--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a3e7b7e4b0f14bc6d27948","internalStoryPackageCode":"83632","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T12:18:57Z","standfirst":"David Williams speaks for first time since landing airliner with 447 passengers on board following problems with landing gear","linkText":"Pilot hailed for Gatwick emergency landing says he was just doing his job","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T13:26:30.412Z","internalContentCode":"454064374"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/pilot-gatwick-emergency-landing-david-williams","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/pilot-gatwick-emergency-landing-david-williams","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"b348bb906d9d43f9fe668c4f61ddd86e3a1e5fe6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420028249044/Passengers-disembark-the--016.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*49162765","suppliersReference":"460891108","altText":"Passengers disembark the Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 at Gatwick after the emergency landing","caption":"Passengers disembark from the Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 at Gatwick after the emergency landing.

The RMT gave some hope of respite for staff on Wednesday after claiming that a potential rescuer had enquired about buying all or some of the business.</p> <p>Mick Cash, the RMT’s general secretary, said: “Within the past 24 hours RMT has been made aware of what we believe to be a credible bid to take over some or all of the City Link trading operation.</p> <p>“At this stage we have no further details and we understand the matter is in the hands of the administrators with the government and [business secretary] Vince Cable aware of the situation. With today key in terms of redundancies RMT is urging the administrators to suspend the redundancy process and work with the government and the administrators to urgently evaluate and act on any viable options that could keep City Link trading as a going concern.”</p> <p>Administrators at Ernst &amp; Young (EY), who were formally appointed on Christmas Eve, have warned staff to expect “substantial redundancies” at the parcel firm’s depots around the country. A small number are expected to be retained to help deal with the estimated 30,000 parcels still being held at City Link’s depots, all of which are set to remain open until around 6 January.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/30/parcel-delivery-jobs-city-link-staff-apc-overnight\" title=\"\">courier company APC Overnight</a> said it would give priority to City Link staff in filling up to 100 vacancies at its national sorting centre in Cannock.</p> <p>The RMT has called on the business secretary, Vince Cable, to rescue the firm but Jon Moulton, the veteran private equity investor who heads City Link’s owner, Better Capital, has said the government was aware of the courier’s troubles before Christmas and did not request a meeting to discuss its future. He said the firm needed about £100m to turn itself around.</p> <p>Better Capital expects to <a

Tem peratures are likely to hold up above freezing across the country, with values ranging from around 3C across some eastern areas, to a very mild 10C in parts of the west.</p> <p>Edinburgh is likely to be cloudy but dry for its Hogmanay celebrations, with a chance of the odd wintry shower early on in the evening. The evening should be mild in the city, with minimum temperatures at 9C or 10C at midnight.</p> <p>Dublin will be milder still, at a likely 11C. The Irish capital is also likely to experience showers early on but should be dry in the run up to midnight.</p> <p>According to the Met Office, the last few days have seen some of the coldest temperatures of the year so far.</p> <p>Cromdale in Moray, Scotland, saw -9C in the early hours of 27 December, the coldest in the UK this year. England, Wales and Northern Ireland endured their lowest temperatures the following night.</p> <p>Researchers suggest this year could be the UK’s warmest, as measured by the world’s oldest temperature record over almost 250 years.</p> <p>The 11 months from January to November have already been the warmest period on the Met Office’s Central England Temperature record.</p> <p>A spokesman for MeteoGroup said: “For New Year’s Eve night the temperatures will be down to about 4C or 5C , which will be the same for most parts of the UK. In the west and north temperatures could be around 7C so much milder than the previous few nights.</p> <p>“It will be a good evening to be out as it is mostly dry over much of England. The north and west might see some patchy rain, as will Scotland but it won’t be a bad night for being outside anywhere.”</p> <p>The Met Office warned that the weather is set to change from the current crisp winter days, with a rise in temperatures and more unsettled, windy weather.</p> <p>Through the course of New Year’s Day, it will gradually turn wet and windy across the whole of the country – but it should stay mild.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934902","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216572","internalRevision":"21","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Cold weather to shift as Hogmanay revellers in Edinburgh will enjoy 10C with 11C in Dublin and temperatures well above zero around most of UK","allowUgc":"false","headline":"New Year’s Eve weather forecast: mild, largely dry, and probably quite fun","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Press Association","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T10:14:29.721Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420020603121/47cb3586-f9f8-476a-ab50-2271ec50e351-140x84.jpeg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gf7","wordcount":"454","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420020603121/47cb3586-f9f8-476a-ab50-2271ec50e351-140x84.jpeg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a3cab1e4b048dfa4053ad2","internalStoryPackageCode":"83627","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T10:14:29Z","standfirst":"<p>Cold weather to shift as Hogmanay revellers in Edinburgh will enjoy 10C with 11C in Dublin and temperatures well above zero around most of UK</p>","linkText":"New Year’s Eve weather forecast: mild, largely dry, and probably quite fun","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T10:22:54.027Z","internalContentCode":"454059672"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/new-years-eve-weather-forecast","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/new-years-eve-weather-forecast","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"b1329e7fe4e7139194a719d6623fce7c0d578037","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420020602448/47cb3586-f9f8-476a-ab50-2271ec50e351-220x132.jpeg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*49178700","suppliersReference":"460918746","altText":"Vikings take part in a torchlight procession markign the start of Hogmanay in Edinburgh","caption":"People dressed as Vikings take part in a torchlight procession markig the start of Hogmanay in Edinburgh.

Particularly when there’s children involved, it has a tremendous impact on our folks.”</p> <p>Knecht did not release the name of the suspect, but said the man was well known to police and had a criminal record dating back to September 1987.</p> <p>Investigators said the 9mm handgun used in the killings was a registered weapon that had been stolen in Surrey, British Columbia, in 2006.</p> <p>Cindy Duong, 37, was fatally shot in a home in south Edmonton on Monday, while two men and three women between the ages of 25 and 50, and a girl and a boy – both under the age of 10 – were found dead a few hours later at a home in the north-east.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/dec/31/nine-dead-canada-edmonton-murders-domestic-violence-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/44get\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2216556\"            data-video-name=\"Nine dead in Canada murders - video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-454058307\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/12/31/1420016089106/crop_KP-61778_1200.jpeg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/12/31/141231Edmonton_desk.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/12/31/141231Edmonton_small.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/12/31/141231Edmonton.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/12/31/141231Edmonton_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/12/31/141231Edmonton_large.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Nine dead in Canada murders</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The suspect was found dead by his own hand in a restaurant in the Edmonton community of Fort Saskatchewan on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Autopsies will be conducted on Thursday.</p> <p>Duong’s body was found at around 7pm on Monday when police responded to a report of a man entering the south-side home, opening fire and fleeing, Knecht said.</p> <p>An hour and a half later, officers responded to reports of a suicidal man at a north-east residence in a quiet cul de sac, the same home where the suspect had been arrested in November 2012 and charged with domestic and sexual assault.</p> <p>Family members reported in the call that the man was depressed and over-emotional.</p> <p>When officers arrived, no one answered the door, Knecht said. They searched the exterior of the home but found nothing overtly suspicious and did not go inside. “We can’t just arbitrarily go into that residence,” explained the chief.</p> <p>Hours later police were contacted by a second person and returned to the residence. When they went inside, they found a scene of carnage with seven bodies.</p> <p>Neighbour Moe Assiff said he saw officers arrive and talk to a woman sitting with a man in a white car outside the house.</p> <p>“She just let out a hysterical scream. It was eerie,” Assiff said. “She was screaming about her kids: ’My kids! The kids!’, grabbing her hair and trying to pull her hair out. The cops then ushered her down the road into a police cruiser.”</p> <p>The suspect’s body was found hours later at the VN Express Asian restaurant in Fort Saskatchewan after police brought in tactical-team officers, surrounded the area and reportedly smashed through the front of the restaurant with a vehicle.</p> <p>Knecht said the suspect had a business interest in the restaurant, but would not say if he was the owner.</p> <p>Outside the restaurant, police found a parked black SUV that they say was seen near the location of the first shooting.</p> <p>Alberta’s premier, Jim Prentice, said in a statement that he trusted the police investigation would provide answers as people struggle to understand what happened.</p> <p>“In this season of peace and goodwill, this act of violence is all the more difficult to comprehend. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those involved at this very difficult time. May they find strength in knowing that Albertans share in their loss.”</p> <p>At their game on Tuesday night, the Edmonton Oilers paused for a moment of silence for the victims.</p> <p>In Edmonton, a city of 878,000 people, mass murders are extremely rare. Knecht said the case was the worst mass killing in the city since at least 1956, when six people were murdered.</p> <p>John Etter Clark, a provincial politician who served as a member of the legislative assembly of Alberta for four years, killed his wife, son, three daughters and an employee of their family farm before taking his own life in 1956. Clark had been suffering from frequent nervous breakdowns in the years before the killings.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935101","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216605","internalRevision":"23","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Man killed six adults and two children before turning gun on himself in ‘planned and deliberate’ domestic violence incident","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Canada mass killer had criminal record dating back to 1987","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Associated Press","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T11:39:59.341Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420025880222/The-body-of-a-victim-is-c-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ggd","wordcount":"709","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420025880222/The-body-of-a-victim-is-c-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a3df57e4b084424a7b2e47","internalStoryPackageCode":"83707","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T11:39:59Z","standfirst":"Man killed six adults and two children before turning gun on himself in ‘planned and deliberate’ domestic violence incident","linkText":"Canada mass killer had criminal record dating back to 1987","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T13:19:17.345Z","internalContentCode":"454062868"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/mass-murder-edmonton-canada","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/mass-murder-edmonton-canada","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"82c0f5aacd98bc627ef6f5eeb6733b5a634873d7","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420025885489/The-body-of-a-victim-is-c-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AP","picdarUrn":"GD*49176982","suppliersReference":"EDM106","altText":"The body of a victim is carried out of a north Edmonton home after mass murder in Alberta, Canada","caption":"The body of a victim is carried out of a north Edmonton home after mass murder in Alberta, Canada.

I can think of many more worthy recipients of this honour, but once again it looks like the establishment is looking after their own.”</p> <p>Woolf, who is already a CBE, received the damehood for services to the legal profession, diversity and the City of London.</p> <p>Butler-Sloss blamed the Home Office for failing to perform proper checks on Woolf’s links to the former home secretary Lord Brittan.</p> <p>Butler-Sloss, who stood down from her role on the inquiry panel in July because her late brother Sir Michael Havers was attorney general in the 1980s, was speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme in her role as guest editor.</p> <p>Defending the decision to award the honour, she said: “[Woolf] was lord mayor of London, she is only the second woman ever to be lord mayor of London. The very least that the honours system could do would be to honour a woman who has got such a distinguished post.</p> <p>“Unfortunately she had, like myself, a brief period where she had agreed – for goodness sake, she had agreed to do a very disagreeable job to become chairman. And because she happened to know Leon Brittan, she was unacceptable to the survivors and therefore she stood down.”</p> <p>She criticised officials for failing to spot the potential difficulties the contacts with Brittan could cause.</p> <p>“I don’t know what happened. There was discussion between her and, presumably, the Home Office. I think they made a mistake in not doing sufficient due diligence, actually.</p> <p>“But the fact is she is a very distinguished woman, she did a wonderful year’s job as lord mayor and of course she gets an honour for it, that’s why she gets it. To put if off to another time would be a reflection on the City of London.”</p> <p>Woolf was a friend and neighbour of Brittan, who is under scrutiny because a dossier containing accusations about Westminster paedophile activity went missing from his department during the 1980s. He denies any failure to act.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934904","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216585","internalRevision":"11","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Lawyer forced to resign as chair of child abuse inquiry was honoured for work as lord mayor of London, says Butler-Sloss","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Criticism of Fiona Woolf damehood unfair, says inquiry predecessor","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Rowena Mason and agencies","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T10:48:06.802Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420022765931/Fiona-Woolf-received-dame-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gfk","wordcount":"526","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420022765931/Fiona-Woolf-received-dame-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a3d32ee4b0f14bc6d27943","internalStoryPackageCode":"83628","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T10:48:07Z","standfirst":"Lawyer forced to resign as chair of child abuse inquiry was honoured for work as lord mayor of London, says Butler-Sloss","linkText":"Criticism of Fiona Woolf damehood unfair, says inquiry predecessor","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T15:51:42.000Z","internalContentCode":"454061353"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/criticism-fiona-woolf-damehood-unfair-butler-sloss","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/criticism-fiona-woolf-damehood-unfair-butler-sloss","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"e5944845d56a2b1552560af1ecfcd122231adf2f","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420022771365/Fiona-Woolf-received-dame-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*49173316","suppliersReference":"182531547","altText":"Fiona Woolf received damehood for services to the legal profession, diversity and the City of London","caption":"Fiona Woolf received a damehood for services to the legal profession, diversity and the City of London.

After a lifetime of abuse, she was penniless and alone, but free of her violent husband.</p> <p>“The happiest thing in my life was getting my divorce certificate,” said the 69-year-old from China’s northern Hebei province.</p> <p>Women’s rights advocates hope future victims will not have to wait so long to live in safety; Chinese authorities recently issued the first draft law on domestic violence.</p> <p>While it is welcomed as a breakthrough, grave concerns remain about the obvious loopholes in the legislation. It does not cover cohabitees, divorced couples or same-sex relationships. Nor does it address sexual violence.</p> <p>Women’s groups hope that officials will take heed of the public consultation which has just closed.</p> <p>“All intimate relationships should be included, be it dating, cohabitation or same-sex relationships. Violence that happens during separation after divorce should also be addressed, because people in those situations are more likely to be victims than those in marriage. We hope to push forward changes and improvements,” said Li Hongtao, professor at China Women’s University.</p> <p>But she said it was the most significant advance that women’s organisations and domestic violence intervention groups had seen in 14 years of pushing for progress, particularly because it spells out how authorities should respond to cases.</p> <p>“The most significant and striking feature is that from now on the government will need to be responsible; when domestic violence happens, all relevant departments should take action and assume their responsibilities. Domestic violence is no longer a private family matter between individuals,” she said.</p> <p>Feng Yuan, co-founder of anti-domestic violence group Equality and long-time women’s rights advocate, described the new law as very significant but still a “work in progress”.</p> <p>The marriage law was amended to ban domestic violence in 2001, but Feng said existing legislation did not address the problem systematically as the draft law does. The consultation process also raised the awareness of the public and allowed it to hear the voices of victims and grassroots advocates.</p> <p>“In the past, people didn’t even recognise the existence of domestic violence, and now they generally see it as a social evil,” she said.</p> <p>“But most of the time, people still don’t see hidden domestic violence [violence that does not cause serious physical harm]. And the public, even legislators, still disagree on whether addressing the issue should involve the state.”</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-11/26/content_18980189.htm\" title=\"\">report from the official All China Women’s Federation last month</a> said that nearly 40% of Chinese women who were married or in a relationship had experienced physical or sexual violence.</p> <p>“It is not a private issue but a social problem,” stressed Tan Lin, head of the federation, as it released the research.</p> <p>In many cases, families are complicit: Han’s mother-in-law also beat and verbally abused her, and her adult son and daughter opposed her attempts to leave their father. They have not spoken to her or given her any financial assistance since she was granted the divorce.</p> <p>When Zhang Hong, 39, tried to flee her violent marriage, her mother-in-law hid her young child for three months so that she had to stay. When she finally filed for divorce, her husband’s relatives snatched the child while he assaulted her. A court awarded her custody last year, and she has now moved to a new city with the child, but her husband is appealing.</p> <p>Both women – whose names have been changed to protect their identities – initially stayed with their husbands because they felt they should do so for their children’s sake. But when they sought help, little was forthcoming.</p> <p>When Zhang first called the police, her ex-husband claimed she was responsible for the violence and the officers left without even taking statements: “To them, it’s just quarrels between couples,” she said.</p> <p>Even when neighbours and security guards called for help on her behalf – because she could not do so during assaults – police and the local neighbourhood committee merely tried to mediate between her and her violent husband.</p> <p>“There should be support for victims before their cases enter the legal process. There should be more efforts to secure their safety,” said Zhang.</p> <p>The draft law states that courts must rule on requests for restraining orders within 48 hours, which should offer women greater protection. But victims must then start a lawsuit within 30 days or the order will lapse, it adds. Experts warn that means victims having to make decisions while under stress and to find the money and other resources to take up a legal case.</p> <p>It requires schools and hospitals to report suspected violence in some circumstances and police to look into reports of violence – but allows officers to issue a written warning if they do not believe it is serious enough to apply criminal charges or administrative punishment.</p> <p>Tackling the problem will mean changing attitudes as well as updating legislation. Zhang hopes the media will do more to highlight the gravity of domestic violence, while Feng suggested educators should introduce classes on the problem and that employers should cover the issue in their code of conduct for staff.</p> <p>But Zhang’s decision not to tell her friends about what she has endured testifies to how far there is still to go in raising public awareness.</p> <p>“We are in the big city; it’s not some remote village where you can imagine domestic violence existing,” she said.</p> <p>“They would only think that it was unimaginable.”</p> <p><em>Additional research by Luna Lin.</em></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9916611","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216688","internalRevision":"8","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Chinese women’s rights activists welcome breakthrough but say law does not address sexual violence or cover cohabitees","allowUgc":"false","headline":"First women to benefit from new Chinese laws on domestic violence","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Tania Branigan in Beijing","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T14:21:28.889Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035591605/China-domestic-violence-004.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gjf","wordcount":"922","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035591605/China-domestic-violence-004.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a403fbe4b084424a7b2e71","internalStoryPackageCode":"83675","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T14:21:29Z","standfirst":"Chinese women’s rights activists welcome breakthrough but say law does not address sexual violence or cover cohabitees","linkText":"First women to benefit from new Chinese laws on domestic violence","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-31T14:24:42.000Z","internalContentCode":"454069761"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/first-women-beneift-chinese-laws-domestic-violence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/first-women-beneift-chinese-laws-domestic-violence","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"72eef1359ffe571edeab01f7cba15672ab110a4c","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420035597266/China-domestic-violence-009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"EPA","picdarUrn":"PD*6294788","suppliersReference":"PEK02","altText":"China domestic violence","caption":"Kong Fanyuan, a 56-year-old victim of domestic violence from northern China's Hebei province, wearing a placard on her clothing that reads 'Greatest Injustice'.

Imagine what she’s been through having had a journey back from where she’s been working very, very hard as part of a team in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>“She’s had a long journey back, finally making it home, then becoming unwell, then being taken away from her home again. It’s been a very unsettled time for her, which she’s coping with remarkably.”</p> <p>Jacobs said her treatment so far had “gone very smoothly, no side-effects at all” and that they would know in a week whether she was recovering.</p> <p>He declined to name the anti-viral drug that will be used to treat Cafferkey, but said it was incredibly safe despite being “not proven to work”.</p> <p>“At the moment, we don’t know what the best treatment strategies are. That’s why we’re calling them experimental treatments,” he said.</p> <p>“As we’ve explained to Pauline, we can’t be as confident as we would like. There’s obviously very good reason to believe it’s going to help her, otherwise we wouldn’t be using it at all, but we simply don’t have enough information to know that’s the case.”</p> <p>Jacobs also declined to confirm whether she would receive the convalescent plasma from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/11/will-pooley-treating-ebola-patients-sierra-leone-wonderful-job\">British Ebola survivor William Pooley</a>, who was cured of the virus by a nursing team led by Jacobs at the Royal Free in September.</p> <p>Pooley banked 1.2 litres of his plasma to help future Ebola patients before leaving for Freetown in October. Doctors do not need to seek his consent before using his plasma either for research or to treat a patient.</p> <p>Six other Ebola survivors have been treated in European hospitals, including a Spanish nurse, a Norwegian doctor and a Ugandan medic treated in Germany.</p> <p>In September, Pooley’s plasma was used to treat Dr Ian Crozier, a World Health Organisation doctor who worked at the same government hospital in Sierra Leone and who contracted the virus weeks after Pooley. He went on to survive, spending 40 days in hospital.</p> <p>Jacobs said the hospital had been unable to obtain the experimental drug ZMapp, which was used to treat Pooley, because there was simply none in the world at the moment.</p> <p>Save the Children has launched an investigation into whether Cafferkey contracted the virus outside its Kerry Town treatment centre, where she had treated Ebola patients. There have been suggestions that she may have caught the disease while out in the local community over the Christmas period.</p> <p>Sources at other volunteer groups, including Médecins sans Frontières and Dublin-based organisation Goal, said they had no plans to overhaul their procedures in the wake of Cafferkey’s diagnosis. More NHS health workers are due to be trained and deployed to west Africa in the coming weeks, with nearly 40 known having flown out since 6 December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc462306f432d76a798f83b8a48b6da8702d2fe8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/1/1420106224062/9c469441-2b04-4fa0-873a-191d680db794-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pauline Cafferkey, centre, leaving for Sierra Leone in November.

Airport screening for people coming from affected areas is under review.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/LNP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, conceded that the case raised questions over Ebola screening precautions. She said reports of queues for screening and equipment shortages at Heathrow were concerning and would be fixed before the next batch of volunteers are due to return in mid-January.</p> <p>“Clearly, queuing and things like that are unacceptable and we will review. But we will let people who are well travel because they will not infect the public,” she said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Scottish government and Scottish NHS agencies refused to disclose when they had been told that Cafferkey had warned officials at Heathrow she felt feverish, and had been given seven temperature tests – none of which detected an elevated temperature – before she was cleared to fly to Glasgow on Sunday.</p> <p>Public Health England admitted on Tuesday evening that this raised questions about the effectiveness of current screening procedures at British airports. Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, confirmed that Cafferkey was in the early stages of the disease while she was flying home.</p> <p>Davies stressed the public health risks were therefore negligible but confirmed that the UK’s screening policies were being reconsidered. “The process does seem to have not been as good as we all want to see,” she said.</p> <p>The Scottish government, which oversees screening and Scottish airports, and Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS, which has responsibility for Glasgow airport, refused to confirm whether they shared Public Health England’s new concerns.</p> <p>Health Protection Scotland launched an urgent effort to contact all other 70 passengers on board the BA flight to warn them to watch out for symptoms, soon after she was admitted with Ebola hours after arriving home.</p> <p>“It is understood that protocols for screening the patient were followed and she was allowed to travel on the grounds that her temperature was checked repeatedly and she didn’t have a fever,” a Scottish government spokeswoman said.</p> <p>“As the first minister [Nicola Sturgeon] made clear, the patient was not displaying any of the symptoms that would had put other people at risk.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936002","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216745","internalRevision":"38","publication":"The

But the impact will be felt first in Athens.'  Illustration: Eva Bee</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>A decade and a half into the 21st century, we’re still living through the aftermath of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/19/new-world-order\">two epoch-making shocks</a>. The first was the demonstration of the limits of US power in the killing fields of Afghanistan and Iraq – the war on terror that broke the spell of invincibility of the world’s first truly global empire. The second was the financial crash of 2008 and the crisis of the western-dominated economic system it unleashed, still playing havoc with economies and lives across the world more than six years later.</p> <p>That crisis will shape politics in Europe in 2015, from London to Madrid. But the impact will be felt first in Athens. The slump and stagnation that followed the crash has already fuelled the rise of the populist right. Now, after years of self-defeating austerity and falling living standards, the radical left has leapfrogged ahead to challenge for power in the most devastated eurozone economies of Greece and Spain.</p> <p>It was a backlash waiting to happen. In Greece the leftwing Syriza party, which rejects the austerity enforced across the eurozone by its unelected troika, is favourite to win the snap elections called for the end of January. Syriza may have stepped back from its one-time demand for unilateral debt cancellation, its programme to boost living standards in the wake of a 1930s-style depression may be modest, and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/48e6fa76-70bd-11e4-8113-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3NQLa0zlM\">mainstream voices across Europe may also be calling for a change of direction</a>. But Europe’s governing elites will have none of it.</p> <p>Expect a ferocious campaign to terrify Greek voters, who have already been <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/12/us-greece-eurozone-juncker-idUSKBN0JQ16E20141212\">warned by the European commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker not to vote the “wrong” way</a>. If Greeks still insist on making their own democratic choice, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/29/syriza-greece-austerity-eu\">everything will be done to force Syriza to retreat</a>. If all else fails, Greece will be punished for fear that others, such as Spain’s new Podemos party, might go down the same route later in the year.</p> <p>The powers that be in Europe are determined to prop up a failed economic model regardless of the cost – as they will be in Britain if Labour wins the general election in May. The aftershocks of the breakdown of that neoliberal regime are still being felt across the world economy – in falling commodity prices, capital flight, stagnation and recession. But the interests that depend on it won’t let go without a serious challenge.</p> <p>That’s just as true in terms of global power. The US and its satellites, including Britain, may have suffered a strategic defeat in Iraq and Afghanistan – symbolised by last weekend’s ceremony to mark <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/28/nato-ends-afghanistan-combat-operations-after-13-years\">the end of Nato’s combat mission</a>, held in secret for fear of Taliban attacks. But they’re not letting go either. Some 13,000 troops are staying on as “trainers”, just as thousands of western troops have been returning to Iraq for the war against Isis – the al-Qaida breakaway spawned by their own invasion and occupation – with talk of a major assault in the spring.</p> <p>In the same spirit, every effort was made at the time of the Arab uprisings of 2011 to hijack, control or crush them. Some of the results can be seen today in the disaster zone across the Middle East, the growing power of the western-backed autocracies of the Gulf, the brutality of Egypt’s new dictatorship and the maelstrom in post-intervention Libya, whose civil war is likely to intensify in the coming months.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Russia’s challenge to untrammelled US strategic power, which began in Georgia in 2008 and intensified through Syria’s proxy war, has come to a head in the conflict in Ukraine. There has been much western crowing in recent weeks that the combination of collapsing oil prices with US and EU sanctions has plunged Russia into recession, while knocking chunks out of the economies of other independent oil states such as Iran and Venezuela into the bargain. It seems clear enough that the Saudi regime’s decision to boost oil output when prices were already falling was designed not only to protect market share and undercut fracking, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/nov/09/us-iran-russia-oil-prices-shale\">to punish Iran and Russia</a> for their role in the Middle East and Europe to the benefit of Riyadh’s US sponsor.</p> <p>It is a form of economic warfare – <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/be4f1f0e-8f6d-11e4-b080-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3NQLa0zlM\">hailed by President Obama this week as the fruit of “strategic patience”</a> – the consequences of which will be felt across the world in the months to come. But along with the global power and economic shocks of the past decade, two other crucial shifts have defined the early 21st century: the economic rise of China, in defiance of market orthodoxy, and the tide of progressive change that has swept Latin America, opening up alternatives to neoliberal capitalism.</p> <p>Both have continued despite the backwash from the crash, which has taken its toll on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS\">the “Brics” countries</a> and the wider global south. Progressive governments have carried on being elected from Bolivia to Brazil, while China’s slowing growth rate is still almost double that delivered by the US recovery. Political and financial pressure on Venezuela, which has been crucial to Latin America’s transformation and already faces serious economic problems, however, looks set to increase in the coming year. The key to riding the storm, as elsewhere, will be who is made to shoulder the burden of falling income and reform.</p> <p>What seems certain though is that, however much the west tries to recapture lost ground, the global order will not revert to the status quo ante. There may be growing conflict, but there will be no return to unchallenged US diktat or uncontested economic catechisms. Alternative centres of power are forming.

South Yorkshire police said the 61-year-old man, Stephen Starkey, was attacked at his home in the Lowedges area of Sheffield by a man who took a PlayStation 3 console and cash from him.</p> <p>His friend and neighbour Derek Wilkinson, 79, described how Starkey managed to cross the road to his house to raise the alarm after he was assaulted on Christmas morning.</p> <p>Wilkinson said he called the emergency services after his friend described how he was knocked to the ground by someone who called at his door. He said Starkey lived by himself and had been attacked earlier this year in a similar incident. “This bloke had come and knocked him down in the doorway and pinched his things off him. He [Starkey] come over to me and we rung for ambulances and police and things like that. He was very shook up. He’d done his shoulder, I think, and they’d knocked him about.”</p> <p>A police spokesman said Starkey had died in hospital.</p> <p>Wilkinson, who said he had lived in the street for 40 years, added that Starkey had lived alone in the house for 30 years. He added: “I knew him very well – a very big friend of mine. He was a smashing fella … a very nice fella and he’ll be missed.”</p> <p>Wilkinson said his friend used to work locally for the council’s housing department as a caretaker. “It’s a very quiet area usually. Fairly quiet. They’re all bought properties, mainly.”</p> <p>Other neighbours said Starkey was not in good health and was frail. Police described him as vulnerable.</p> <p>A 37-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident but was released on bail pending further inquiries. A second man, aged 40, was later arrested on suspicion of murder, and was still in custody on Wednesday night.</p> <p>In a statement, the force said: “The 61-year-old man who died after a reported assault and robbery at his home in Lowedges on Christmas Day has been named as Stephen Paul Starkey. Mr Starkey was at his home in Reney Crescent on Thursday 25 December when at around 10.30am a man entered his property, allegedly assaulting him and stealing items. Mr Starkey was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries where he later died.</p> <p>“The family of Mr Starkey have asked for privacy while they grieve their loss and request the media to respect this wish at this difficult time.”</p> <p>The statement said a postmortem examination had yet to be carried out.</p> <p>Before Starkey died, Det Insp Richard Partridge said the assault had taken place in broad daylight. “We believe that the suspect deliberately targeted this man’s house, forcing his way into the property and injuring a vulnerable member of the community before stealing valuables.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935053","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216615","internalRevision":"28","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Police question two men after 61-year-old dies in hospital following theft of  PlayStation  and cash in broad daylight","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Man dies after being robbed at home in Sheffield on Christmas Day","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Press Association","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T12:06:30Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420027444977/Police-officer-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ggn","wordcount":"477","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420027444977/Police-officer-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a3e505e4b084424a7b2e49","newspaperPageNumber":"16","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T12:06:30Z","standfirst":"Police question two men after 61-year-old dies in hospital following theft of  PlayStation  and cash in broad daylight","linkText":"Man dies after being robbed at home in Sheffield on Christmas Day","creationDate":"2014-12-31T11:59:01Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:50:03Z","internalContentCode":"454063713"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/man-dies-robbery-sheffield-christmas-day","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/man-dies-robbery-sheffield-christmas-day","sectionName":"UK news","elements":[{"id":"07b46b5460a04268dc2933e39b071a1582d35fc4","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420027451048/Police-officer-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Christopher Thomond","picdarUrn":"GD*46925297","altText":"Police officer","caption":"Police said a 37-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the incident.

Photograph: Allstar/Mars Distribution</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Cash registers are ringing in cinemas across France, where a string of breakout French comedy films has swelled audiences to near record levels this year.</p> <p>With a feelgood film about a deaf family, La Famille Bélier, attracting 2 million cinemagoers since it opened two weeks ago, the French are turning their backs on the economic crisis and heading to the cinemas for a laugh.</p> <p>According to French box office figures for 2014, a total of 210m tickets were expected to have been sold by the end of New Year’s Eve, almost 10% more than last year.</p> <p>“The only lesson I take from this is that the audience feels a deep need to be addressed and entertained at the same time. All the more so because we’re going through particularly gloomy times,” says Christian Clavier, the star of 2014’s biggest French hit, Qu’est-ce qu’on a fait au bon Dieu. Entitled Serial (Bad) Weddings in English, its irreverent take on mixed marriages has attracted 12.2 million spectators since opening in April. It shows how a conservative couple cope when their three daughters marry an Arab, a Jew and a Chinese man.</p> <p>Clavier, whose 1993 medieval farce The Visitors took France by storm and who is now promoting a new comedy which opened on Wednesday, says he feels humble about the success of Qu’est-ce qu’on a fait au bon Dieu. He says it came as a surprise.</p> <p>Right behind Clavier’s film in the box office charts for 2014 is the French comedy Supercondriaque, about a raging hypochondriac, directed by another well-known comic, Dany Boon, who also stars in the film. A total of 5.27 million people have seen it so far.</p> <p>The breakthrough by the French film comedies this year comes despite strong competition from American blockbusters. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Lucy and the finale of the Hobbit trilogy hold the 3rd, 4th and 5th place in the French charts for 2014.</p> <p>But a number of other French movies which had been expected to do well, including Bertrand Bonello’s Saint Laurent – one of two films about fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent – and Mathieu Kassovitz’s Vie Sauvage, failed to appeal to the masses.</p> <p>French commentators have attributed the success of Clavier’s last film to the personal allure of the actor, who now lives in London.</p> <p>Although he acknowledges the influence of Peter Sellers on his work, Clavier is quintessentially French. “I’m convinced that if a number of my films have been successful, it’s precisely because they conveyed a good deal about France,” he says.</p> <p>Clavier has teamed up with director Patrice Leconte for the fourth time for his new film, Une Heure de Tranquillité – Do Not Disturb – about a jazz fan who is prevented from listening to a rare album when events conspire against him.</p> <p>With a tagline of “Selfish – me?”, Leconte hopes that the film, adapted by the writer Florian Zeller from his stage play, will strike a chord with the public. “Everyone can relate to that,” Leconte told a television interviewer.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935710","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216715","internalRevision":"8","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The French are turning their backs on economic woe, with a string of homegrown comedies swelling cinema audiences by almost 10%","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"French cinemas ring to the sound of laughter – and cash registers","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Anne Penketh in Paris","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T15:05:34Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420038280181/A-still-from-La-Famille-B-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gkf","wordcount":"520","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420038280181/A-still-from-La-Famille-B-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a40f2be4b048dfa4053b05","newspaperPageNumber":"21","internalStoryPackageCode":"83642","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T15:05:34Z","standfirst":"The French are turning their backs on economic woe, with a string of homegrown comedies swelling cinema audiences by almost 10%","linkText":"French cinemas ring to the sound of laughter – and cash registers","creationDate":"2014-12-31T14:58:51Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:05:50Z","internalContentCode":"454071052"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/french-cinemas-comedies-audiences-10-percent-more","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/french-cinemas-comedies-audiences-10-percent-more","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"55651b664920f5637657261b02fc7043fd7a5e13","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420038285408/A-still-from-La-Famille-B-011.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*49022946","suppliersReference":"ENT_SAJ37960","altText":"A still from La Famille Belier","caption":"A still from hit French comedy La Famille Bélier, which has been seen by 2 million cinemagoers since it opened two weeks ago.

Last winter it was no good – just wet and mild. Three weeks of non-stop snow and frost, that’s probably the best scenario to keep the mine going for 12 months a year.”</p> <p>Famed as Winsford’s “overtime king”, Gibbons, 58, has been known to put in an extra 30 hours on top of his regular 40-hour week during prolonged cold snaps, when the mine can produce up to 8,000 tonnes a day. When the Guardian met him underground, back in November, his prospects for overtime were looking poor after an unusually balmy year: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/dec/28/weather-2014-warmest-record-uk\" title=\"\">according to the Met Office</a>, 2014 has been the eighth warmest year since 1659.</p> <p>Around 50% of the rock salt sprinkled on UK roads as “grit” comes from Winsford. It has operated as a mine since 1844 when rock salt deposits were discovered by local prospectors searching for coal. The salt beds are a hangover from the Triassic era, when Cheshire was under the sea. It’s long been known as a salty county – the “wich” appended to many town names in the area, such as Middlewich and Northwich, indicates the presence of brine. In summer you can even swim in <a href=\"http://www.everybody.org.uk/centres/nsp/swimming/\" title=\"\">Nantwich’s brine pool</a>.</p> <p>Production at Winsford was small scale until the explosion of motoring last century when salt began to be sprinkled on the roads to reduce both the freezing and melting points of water, speeding up the rate at which snow turns to water.</p> <p>The mine has since grown steadily and today stretches 5km east to west and 3km north to south. At least 150 miles of roads now exist under the ground, navigated in minibuses via a strictly enforced one-way system. There is even a graveyard for old vehicles. The subterranean air is so salty that any car used underground would rust almost as soon as it reached the surface – it is also difficult to move them above ground – so they are instead abandoned in a dark and salty chamber.</p> <p>Mining salt might not be as hot and dirty as mining coal, but anyone who goes underground needs a good bath afterwards. Stand too close to the mining machine and you end up covered in salty crust - not pure white, but a dirty beige.</p> <p>It is a supremely dry environment, with a constant temperature of 14C – perfect for storing delicate manuscripts and books. A number of years ago the mine branched out into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gallery/2010/aug/10/cheshire-salt-mine-national-archive\" title=\"\">“deep storage”</a>, taking advantage of the excavated voids between the salt stacks. Historic archive materials from scientific charity the Wellcome Trust are held down there, as well as documents from the National Archive.</p> <p>Two other, newer salt mines also exist in the UK: Cleveland Potash mine near Boulby on the north-east coast of the North York Moors, and the Kilroot mine in Northern Ireland, which is operated by a US firm as Irish Salt Sales.</p> <p>For decades, the mines went largely unmentioned, as the UK experienced ever warmer climates. Then the big freeze of February 2009 happened and many councils <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/feb/05/road-gritting-salt-faq\" title=\"\">got caught out</a>, having not ordered enough salt to get them through the extended cold period. London ground to a halt following the first big snow dump, with most trains and buses not leaving their depots for 24 hours.</p> <p>Salt production is a continuous operation, but demand is highly seasonal. The Highways Agency, which manages the motorways and major A roads in England, learnt its lesson after 2009. This year the agency began the winter with more than a quarter of a million tonnes of salt, ready to be spread by a fleet of 437 salt spreaders (or gritters), all fitted with snow ploughs, along with 23 snow blowers. Since 2009, when local authorities claimed they couldn’t get enough salt because the Highways Agency had nabbed it all, the barns used to store it have been enlarged with “crowns”, allowing them to cram more in.</p> <p>Though few motorists relish snowy weather, Andrew Olive loves it. As the severe weather manager for the Highways Agency, he works all year preparing for extreme heat as well as cold, but winter is his favourite season because it’s more “challenging”. When the nights start drawing in and the frost starts to nip, he is in his element: “Come October I’m like a giddy kipper.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9930065","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216775","internalRevision":"16","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Winsford Rock Salt Mine under the Cheshire plains needs a cold snap to produce enough salt to keep councils fully stocked","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Praying for snow: the salt mine keeping Britain’s roads safe","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Helen Pidd, northern editor","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T16:44:28Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420044201054/Miners-at-the-Winsford-Ro-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gmy","wordcount":"764","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420044201054/Miners-at-the-Winsford-Ro-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a4251be4b0f14bc6d27957","newspaperPageNumber":"7","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T16:44:28Z","standfirst":"<p>Winsford Rock Salt Mine under the Cheshire plains needs a cold snap to produce enough salt to keep councils fully stocked</p>","linkText":"Praying for snow: the salt mine keeping Britain’s roads safe","creationDate":"2014-12-31T16:32:27Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T08:59:40Z","internalContentCode":"454074306"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/salt-mine-roads-winsford-cheshire","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/salt-mine-roads-winsford-cheshire","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"5bf50886a516c6936b40f1a6e5226e28d486893d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420044207797/Miners-at-the-Winsford-Ro-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Christopher Thomond","picdarUrn":"GD*33316525","altText":"Miners at the Winsford Rock Salt Mine in Cheshire","caption":"Miners at the Winsford Rock Salt Mine in Cheshire.

It [would have] still been horrible, but a little less horrible.”</p> <p>Moulton, who donated £450,000 to the Conservatives between 2004 and 2011, said Better Capital had probably lost about £20m trying to keep City Link going.</p> <p>Accountants at EY told staff that just 371 of them were to be kept on, but only until a backlog of undelivered Christmas orders had been cleared and the company was wound up.</p> <p>“It is with regret that we have to announce substantial redundancies at City Link Ltd, which ceased accepting new parcels on 24 December 2014,” said joint administrator Hunter Kelly. “The company endured substantial losses, which ultimately became too great for it to continue as a going concern, and City Link Ltd entered administration following an unsuccessful sale process.</p> <p>“At meetings across City Link’s UK sites on Monday December 29 and Tuesday December 30, employees were informed that there would be substantial redundancies as no new business was being taken on. Many of these employees were sent home and informed that they would shortly receive formal correspondence to confirm their work status.”</p> <p>The redundancies came despite a last-minute bid to save the company. The administrators said the unnamed consortium’s bid “offered no money up front and significantly undervalued the assets to be acquired”.</p> <p>Moulton said the consortium was headed by an “unknown businessman from Stoke-on-Trent”. He said he had tried to sell City Link to Amazon, its biggest customer, in the months before the delivery company’s collapse.</p> <p>The redundancies will affect the head office in Coventry as well as hubs and depots around the country. There will be 468 job losses in “central functions”, which includes head office staff, and a further 279 staff will lose their jobs in the Coventry hub.</p> <p>Mick Cash, the general secretary of the RMT union, said: “The confirmation from the administrators that they have just sacked 2,400 staff and are pulling the plug on any efforts to save City Link is a disgraceful and cynical betrayal that will wreck the lives of our members, many of whom are owed thousands of pounds.</p> <p>“RMT does not believe that those pulling the strings had any interest in saving this business and were happy to cut and run, leaving a trail of human misery in their wake. The City Link collapse has blown the lid off the cosy relationship between bandit capitalism and the political elite.</p> <p>“RMT will continue to advise and represent our members caught in this corporate failure. Those responsible will slink away with their own resources ringfenced and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the redundancy tab. The City Link Christmas destruction is an act of industrial vandalism that shames our nation while the Government looked on and offered nothing but hollow words.”</p> <p>Moulton said he hoped “at least a good proportion” of the redundant City Link staff would get new jobs soon. “The administrators said at least 60 employers were chasing them.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the courier company APC Overnight said it would give priority to City Link staff in filling up to 100 vacancies at its national sorting centre in Cannock, Staffordshire.</p> <p>On top of the 2,356 City Link redundancies, 1,000 self-employed drivers face serious financial difficulties with some small businesses owed up to £21,000 in back pay.</p> <p>Phil Valentine, a freelance who runs five vehicles for City Link in the Lake District, said he was owed about £21,000 for two and a half weeks’ work. During that time, he had incurred expenses including drivers’ wages and insurance for the vans plus a £3,000 fuel bill. He has been told he is unlikely to receive any of the money he is owed and will now have to seek new work and pay out as much as £1,200 per van to have them resprayed in the livery of any new employer.</p> <p>“It’s going to be a struggle.

Photograph: Alaa Badarneh/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>In joining the international criminal court, Mahmoud Abbas has finally used one of the most potent diplomatic weapons in the limited Palestinian armoury after years of unfulfilled threats. It is a gesture of near despair by a leader with little left to lose.</p> <p>Signing the Rome statute opens up Palestinian territory to future ICC investigations, a situation which Israel fought a long and intense battle behind the scenes to avoid. It could one day put Israeli soldiers and officials in the dock of an international court for military operations and for the policy of building Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land.</p> <p>ICC membership is a powerful weapon but it is also double-edged. It defines the geographical area in which such crimes can be investigated, and the Palestinian leadership could also define a time period for the prosecutors to examine, but it cannot dictate the target of such an investigation. For example, if Abbas now seeks a retroactive investigation of the last bloody bout of violence in Gaza last summer, <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_palestine_and_the_international_criminal_court303\" title=\"\">as he has the right to do</a>, both the Israel Defence Forces and Hamas would be scrutinised for their actions.</p> <p>That was one reason for delay. Hamas is Abbas’s principal challenger on the Palestinian political scene, but he wanted to secure its approval before making a final decision on ICC membership. There were other reasons for caution. The threat of joining the court was also one of the few meaningful bargaining chips Abbas could take into the negotiating chamber with his Israeli counterpart, Binyamin Netanyahu. Now it has been used, he is virtually empty-handed. But such chips are only of any use when there is a dialogue and a diplomatic process. Right now, there is neither.</p> <p>It is not the first time the Palestinians have sought redress at the ICC, which has been reluctant to get involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As long ago as 2009, they went to the court in The Hague with an ad hoc request for a war crimes investigation in the wake of an earlier Israeli offensive in Gaza, Operation Cast Lead. The chief prosecutor at the time, Luis Moreno Ocampo, took three years to decide on the status of that request <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/aug/18/hague-court-western-pressure-gaza-inquiry\" title=\"\">before announcing in 2012 </a>that it was a decision about Palestinian statehood that could only be taken by the UN general assembly. In November 2012, the UN voted to recognise Palestine as a non-member observer state, which gave it the right to join the ICC and make ad hoc requests for investigations. Moreno Ocampo’s successor as prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, ruled that Palestine’s new status could not be applied to its 2009 request for an investigation. If the leadership wanted such an investigation, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/29/icc-gaza-hague-court-investigate-war-crimes-palestine\" title=\"\">Bensouda argued</a>, it would have submit the request again. But Abbas came under intense pressure from the Israelis, Americans, British and other Europeans not to do so, backed up by threats of financial and economic sanctions.</p> <p>Wednesday’s decision will exact a price in the form of such punitive measures that could <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/middleeast/palestinians-to-join-international-criminal-court-defying-israeli-us-warnings.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes\" title=\"\">cripple the Palestinian Authority</a>. But Abbas clearly decided he had been treading water for far too long. A fter the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/30/un-security-council-rejects-palestinian-statehood-bid\" title=\"\">defeat on Tuesday of a UN security council resolution demanding an end to occupation by 2017</a>, and with his popularity plummeting, he has sought to carve out as much Palestinian sovereignty as he can as a political legacy.</p> <p>Under ICC rules, the Palestinians will have to wait 60 days from the signing of the Rome statute before filing cases at the court, but those two months come in the midst of an Israeli election campaign in which Netanyahu will seek to demonstrate a robust response to the Palestinian challenge.</p> <p>Even once the 60-day waiting period is over, the UN security council has the power to stop ICC investigations from proceeding, and the prosecutor’s office can decide whether investigations should lead to indictments. Israel, the US and their allies can be expected to use all the lobbying power at their disposal to make sure Israeli soldiers and politicians are not indicted.</p> <p>Acquiring ICC membership and satisfying Palestinians’ demands for justice could prove to be very different things.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936013","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216808","internalRevision":"12","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Hamas, as well as the Israeli military, may face scrutiny now Mahmoud Abbas has joined the international criminal court","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"ICC membership could be a double-edged sword for Palestine","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Julian Borger","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T18:04:10Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420048961819/Mahmoud-Abbas-signs-Rome--006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gzv","wordcount":"690","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420048961819/Mahmoud-Abbas-signs-Rome--006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a43878e4b048dfa4053b33","newspaperPageNumber":"2","internalStoryPackageCode":"83625","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T18:04:11Z","standfirst":"Hamas, as well as the Israeli military, may face scrutiny now Mahmoud Abbas has joined the international criminal court","linkText":"ICC membership could be a double-edged sword for Palestine","creationDate":"2014-12-31T17:55:04Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T01:30:03Z","internalContentCode":"454076060"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/icc-membership-double-edged-sword-palestine","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/icc-membership-double-edged-sword-palestine","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"18ec7b2fb22807c77b521c6c8e7c35bdd057935b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420048969324/Mahmoud-Abbas-signs-Rome--011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"EPA","picdarUrn":"GD*49184508","suppliersReference":"ram01","altText":"Mahmoud Abbas signs Rome treaty","caption":"Mahmoud Abbas signs international treaties including the ICC\"s Rome statute.

After the “supertax” was announced in September 2012 the government was accused of shooting itself in the foot by risking an exodus of high-profile personalities. Business leaders expressed fears that investors would pull out of France.</p> <p>France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of luxury group LVMH, took out Belgian nationality, and the actor Gérard Depardieu also moved across the border to Belgium before obtaining Russian citizenship.</p> <p>High-earning French footballers threatened strike action, while league bosses warned they would no longer be able to attract world class players.</p> <p>A majority of French taxpayers disapproved of the 75% rate, although polls showed that six out of 10 voters were in favour of raising income taxes on the wealthy.</p> <p>Despite the backlash Hollande clung to the principle of the supertax even after it was dismissed by the country’s highest court, fearing a revolt by his leftwing allies. The tax was subsequently adjusted to a 50% rate payable by companies after the constitutional council ruling in December 2012.</p> <p>The final nail in the coffin came from the former investment banker who is now France’s economy minister, Emmanuel Macron. A former economic adviser to Hollande, Macron described the supertax as “Cuba without the sun”.</p> <p>With the party leftwingers having marched out of government in the days and months following the appointment of the openly pro-business Manuel Valls as prime minister last March, it was only a matter of time before the tax was dropped. The prime minister confirmed it would not be renewed in 2015 during a visit to London in October, where he addressed business leaders.</p> <p>“The reform clearly damaged France’s reputation and competitiveness,” said Jorg Stegemann, the head of the executive search firm Kennedy Executive. “It clearly has become harder to attract international senior managers to come to France than it was.”</p> <p>Tax lawyer Jean-Philippe Delsol, author on a book on tax exiles called Why I Am Going To Leave France, said last month many high earners had agreed with their companies that salaries would be limited during the two years the tax rate applied, and they would “come to an arrangement afterwards”.</p> <p>Finance ministry studies showed that despite all the publicity, the sums obtained from the supertax were meagre, standing at €260m in 2013 and €160m in 2014, and affecting 1,000 staff in 470 companies. Over the same period, the budget deficit soared to €84.7bn.</p> <p>The decision to drop the tax is a personal blow for Hollande and only one of a number of government U-turns since he was elected, fuelling criticism that he is indecisive and lacking presidential authority.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9936231","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2216838","internalRevision":"8","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Hollande’s measure was meant to force wealthiest to help dig country out of economic crisis, but was accused of being anti-business","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"France forced to drop 75% supertax after meagre returns","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Anne Penketh in Paris","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T19:06:21Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420052690106/Fran-ois-Hollande-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44gp3","wordcount":"511","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420052690106/Fran-ois-Hollande-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"54a447fce4b084424a7b2eb0","newspaperPageNumber":"25","internalStoryPackageCode":"48898","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-03T19:06:21Z","standfirst":"Hollande’s measure was meant to force wealthiest to help dig country out of economic crisis, but was accused of being anti-business","linkText":"France forced to drop 75% supertax after meagre returns","creationDate":"2014-12-31T19:01:16Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-01-01T00:05:45Z","internalContentCode":"454078884"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/france-drops-75percent-supertax","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/france-drops-75percent-supertax","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"8015bc03a26ebd2492154ca7cf66b1bf8a6c168a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/31/1420052696029/Fran-ois-Hollande-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*49095386","suppliersReference":"Par8061536","altText":"François Hollande","caption":"François Hollande announced plans for the controversial supertax during his 2012 election campaign.

European stocks wrapped up the year 3.5% higher overall – though with some striking exceptions, such as near 30% losses for debt-strained Greece and Portugal.</p> <p>The outstanding global equity performer has been China, where the CSI300 index ended 2014 with gains of nearly 50% after two final blockbuster months when hopes grew of more policy stimulus and foreigners won wider access to Chinese stocks.</p> <p>There were hefty gains for China’s biggest train makers, China CNR and CSR Corp, after they confirmed a $26bn merger.</p> <p>“China stocks have done really well this year and the dollar move has also been very interesting,” said Alvin Tan, foreign exchange strategist at French bank Société Générale in London.</p> <p>“It barely moved against the other major currencies in the first half of the year and all the big gains came in the second half.”</p> <p>Among the scraps of news in Europe, two polls in Greece published late on Tuesday showed the anti-bailout party Syriza’s lead over the ruling conservatives had narrowed.</p> <p>Reports that Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah had been admitted to hospital for tests sent stocks there tumbling, with a further fall in the oil price adding to downward pressure.</p> <p>Trade elsewhere was thinned by holidays in Japan, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines, while many markets in Europe were either shut or finishing early for new year festivities.</p> <p>Europe’s government bond markets were already closed after another year when a global flood of cheap money has helped take Italian and Spanish borrowing costs to record lows and given ultra-safe German debt its strongest year in six.</p> <p>The dollar was on track to end 2014 up 12% against a basket of major currencies, its best performance since 2005, and anticipated US interest rate rises may strengthen its appeal in the new year.</p> <p>It eased against the safe haven yen as US trading began to stand at 119.64 yen from Tuesday’s peak of 120.69, while stock futures pointed to small gains for Wall Street, which has jumped 13% and hit repeated record highs this year.</p> <p>The euro, undermined by bets that the European Central Bank will have to start buying government bonds to avert deflation, was stuck at $1.215 having touched a 29-month trough of $1.212.</p> <p>ECB policymaker Peter Praet told a German newspaper: “If my assessment is that there is a need for further accommodation, and if I were willing to cut rates if that had been possible, then I should not be paralysed by the fact that the only option is to buy sovereign bonds.”</p> <p>Having already halved this year, crude prices slumped a further $1.70 to near $56 a barrel as weak Chinese manufacturing data and demand concerns outweighed supply disruptions in Libya.</p> <p>Copper, of which China is the biggest consumer, looked set for its biggest annual decline in three years at 14%, while traditional safe-haven gold hovered at $1,200 an ounce to end the year roughly where it started.</p> <p>Emerging market stocks and bonds were on track for their second straight year in the red, especially Russia.</p> <p>The rouble was down 4% on the day as a 43% plunge since January left it heading for its weakest year since Russia defaulted in 1998.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9935608","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216848","internalRevision":"15","publication":"The

Meanwhile, Roeslani has emerged as one of a trio of Indonesian businessmen who took over Italian football club Inter Milan.</p> <p>Roeslani was forced to resign from the Bumi board in December 2012, after the Takeover Panel revealed he had failed to disclose he was a member of a shareholder concert party with the Bakrie family, who co-founded Bumi with financier Nat Rothschild. Roeslani sold his 13.4% voting stake in Bumi in February 2013 for about £90m.</p> <p>Bumi was founded in a $3bn deal when the powerful Bakrie family placed its coal assets into a cash shell formed by Rothschild. The two sides fell out amid accusations of financial irregularities – strongly denied by the family – and a whistleblower report, which the company alleged was based on hacked emails. In February 2013, Rothschild failed in his attempt to gain control of Bumi but the tie-up ended when the family bought back the Bumi Resources division, leaving ARMS with Berau Coal.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9934928","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216658","internalRevision":"14","publication":"The

nurse.</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Last winter, Hugh Allison, the owner of Inverness Tours, dedicated himself to training four new guides in the plot lines, history and mythology of Outlander, one of the most successful TV series filmed in Scotland – even though it is not yet available to Scottish viewers.</p> <p>The US-produced show, filmed on location in the Scottish Highlands, has garnered comparisons with Game of Thrones, in terms of the dedication of its fans and the complexity of its narrative.</p> <p>The series, which began US screening in August, has led to a surge in tourism as thousands of international fans travel to Scotland to see locations in the show, which is based on the best-selling books by American author Diana Gabaldon.</p> <p>Gabaldon’s novels, which combine historical fiction, romance and fantasy, tell the story of a second world war nurse, Claire Randall, who encounters a druid ritual on a visit to Inverness and finds herself transported back to eighteenth century Scotland. There she is rescued by a Highland rebel as war rages with the English.</p> <p>The books have sold more than 20 million copies. The first episode of the series – which stars Sam Heughan, Caitriona Balfe and Tobias Menzies – attracted 5 million viewers. Sony Pictures has sold it to broadcasters in more than 80 territories around the world.</p> <p>“We realised that there was going to be a huge upsurge in interest, with the television series creating a new fan base,” said Allison, who runs Outlander tours out of Inverness and Edinburgh lasting up to four days. Locations include the battlefield of Culloden and the Clava cairns, where Clare Randall travels in time.</p> <p>While his clients are predominantly north American and female, he says the stories have wide appeal. “It’s an enduring love story, yet it’s far more than that, because it is strongly rooted in history and Diana’s research is meticulous, but there’s also adventure and time travel.”</p> <p>The national tourism organisation VisitScotland has likewise been keen to capitalise on Outlander’s popularity, holding themed events when the series premiered in the US, Scotland’s biggest tourist market. According to the BFI, one in 10 foreign visitors comes to Britain as a result of seeing the country depicted on screen, while 50 million people around the world claim to have Scottish ancestry, chiming with the romantic vision of the clans depicted in Outlander.</p> <p>The success of the television series, which was filmed at a purpose-built studio in Cumbernauld, north Lanarkshire as well as on location around the country, comes at a crucial time for the Scottish film industry. Last week, about 50 leading names of the film industry – including actor and director Peter Mullan, actors Kate Dickie and Daniela Nardini, and Tommy Gormley, the co-producer and assistant director of the new Star Wars film – signed an open letter calling on the Scottish government to build a £15m studio in Glasgow.</p> <p>The Scottish government will hear evidence early in 2015 in an inquiry into the state of the film industry in Scotland, after a damning report commissioned by Creative Scotland found it was trailing behind European rivals because of lack of funding and strategic commitment, a shortage of suitable facilities and a talent drain.</p> <p>Although the Scottish government and Creative Scotland have committed to a permanent studio facility to compete with the likes of Belfast and Cardiff, where Game of Thrones and Doctor Who are filmed, details on possible site locations and funding have yet to emerge.</p> <p>Scottish viewers will soon be able to judge whether Outlander deserves its popularity. Sony, which co-produces the series, confirmed in December that it has secured a, so far unnamed, British broadcaster for the show, which will be screened in 2015.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9890915","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2216815","internalRevision":"15","publication":"The

</figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Jean Stogdon, who has died aged 86, was a full-time housewife and mother until the age of 40, when she began a successful career in social work, later becoming an impassioned champion of grandparents and other relatives raising children who cannot be brought up by their parents. Jean eloquently and consistently argued that the focus on the relationship between parents and children does not reflect the complexity of family life in Britain today.</p> <p>Demonstrating her disdain for all manifestations of ageism, in 1998 Jean applied to become a foundation student at the <a href=\"http://www.the-sse.org/\" title=\"\">School for Social Entrepreneurs</a> in Bethnal Green, east London, created by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jan/16/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Michael Young</a>. Young had been co-author of the seminal 1957 work <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/apr/25/communities.britishidentityandsociety\" title=\"\">Family and Kinship in East London</a>. Kinship care – in which relatives take the place of biological parents – lacked recognition by social workers, policymakers and other professionals. Jean set out to make grandparents a visible part of the family tree.</p> <p>In 1999, she was awarded a Winston Churchill travelling fellowship to the US to examine the experience of those African Americans who had forfeited their grandchildren to stranger (often white) care as their own adult children became unable to parent as a result of Aids and the effects of crack cocaine. Her report won the fellowship’s top prize.</p> <p>In 2001, Jean and Young co-founded the charity <a href=\"http://www.grandparentsplus.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Grandparents Plus</a>. The UK has 13 million grandparents. About 200,000 of them have their grandchildren living with them full time, often on limited incomes. Jean, as an indefatigable co-chair of trustees, became one of Britain’s leading advocates of the belief that the wider family should be considered before a child is placed for adoption or fostering with others.</p> <p>Under her guidance, the charity won a number of victories. It influenced the Children and Young Persons Act 2008 so that the role of grandparents was better recognised, it highlighted the unsung role grandparents play in the provision of childcare and it fought to establish the importance of grandparents’ access to grandchildren after divorce and separation. More recently, Grandparents Plus helped to win the exemption of kinship carers from the rule that recipients of universal credit must be actively seeking work.</p> <p>Jean’s campaigning, the promotion of meticulous research, training and evaluation, and the creation of a kinship care group for professionals, now numbering 180 members from 70 local authorities, and a peer-to-peer network that has grown to 6,000 members, have helped to give kinship care a higher profile. However, what Young called “social blindness” towards the extended family remains, so Jean was campaigning until the last weeks of her life, with her customary vim and vigour.</p> <p>She was born in London, daughter of Mary (nee Ellis) and Percy Sangster. Her father worked for Standard Telephones, where Jean also took a job, as a receptionist, at the age of 17, having left Russell Lane school three years earlier. She had met Bill Stogdon at the local youth club when she was 14. They married in 1948 and had three sons, Philip, Andrew and Mark, and, later, a stillborn daughter. In 1955, the family moved to their own house in north London, where Jean lived for the rest of her life. There she and Bill met a glamorous group that Jean referred to as “the crowd”. It included the actor Shirley Eaton, who became a lifelong friend. Later (Lord) Fenner Brockway would call in for a whisky after a day in the House of Lords; all part of Jean’s journey to becoming a committed socialist – and a feminist.</p> <p>In 1969, ignoring Bill’s protests that he preferred a stay-at-home wife, Jean became a mature social work trainee at North London Polytechnic (now the University of North London). As a trade-off, she still ironed 18 shirts for her family each week and put supper on the table.</p> <p>In 1983, Bill, a bookmaker, bought Jean a cottage, Min Y Don, in Rhiw, north Wales. She cherished the Welsh links with her mother and grandmother, who had been born on the Llŷn peninsula.</p> <p>Jean retired from social work in 1988. She had risen to become an area head, overseeing a team of 200 in Camden, designing a model child-protection service. She loathed red tape. Jean believed in the power of relationships, not form-filling. She could be doggedly persistent and fought majestically for those who had had few breaks in life. Jean subsequently became a children’s guardian – a guardian appointed by the courts to represent a child’s interests in legal cases – for 10 years.</p> <p>Five years ago, Jean was diagnosed with amyloidosis, a rare disease that led to her requiring dialysis three times a week. With typical resilience, she continued her 30-year habit of a daily swim and opted for “twilight dialysis”, driving herself at 5pm for the evening session, so that her days could be free for campaigning. Just before her final illness, she was due to attend a meeting about improving dialysis care, having already succeeded in getting the unit connected to wireless broadband for patients.</p> <p>Bill died in 2005. Jean is survived by their sons, all of whom followed her into social work and social care; four grandchildren, Hannah, Tom, Gracie and Molly; a great-grandchild, Zakariah; and her brother, John.</p>

Photograph: Angela Hampton Picture Library //Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>You turn up for parents’ evening full of questions about your child. But sometimes the teacher seems to mumble or fudge rather than give you a straight reply. Here are truthful answers to some common questions ...</p> <p><strong>I want to ask how my child is doing in relation to her classmates. My question makes teachers look very uncomfortable.</strong> </p> <p>I understand their discomfort. The sense of weighing and measuring one child against others, as opposed to against common standards, can seem like a betrayal of a group of young people whom we teachers also feel a duty of care towards. If I tell you that your child is doing better than Rachel, then I’m telling you how Rachel is doing as well, and you don’t really have a right or need to know that. When pushed, I’ve ventured that a child is in the top/middle/bottom third of the class. However, a better question (being top of a weak class is not necessarily a great achievement) – and the one I ask for my own children – is: “Are they where you’d want them to be at this point?” Teachers will happily tell you whether your child is doing better/similarly/worse than they’d expect, and what appropriate action can be taken.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, what you really want is some sort of gloat-ready statistics that you can post on Facebook about how your child leaves her friends in the dust, then I’ll deliberately spill my cup of tea in your lap while I talk really loudly about her being rock-bottom of the entire school. You sad individual.</p> <p><strong>Why are school reports so formulaic? They say nothing personal about my child. Don’t the teachers know her?</strong></p> <p>Partly this is the inevitable outcome of the bean-counting culture in our education system, where children become numbers on spreadsheets, rather than individuals to be developed. Schools aren’t trying to be distant, but they’ve been told by Ofsted that providing data is how they will be judged, and that parents care only about test results, so that’s what tends to be presented.</p> <p>However, it’s partly a feasibility thing: most secondary school teachers will see hundreds of students each week, often for less than an hour and in the company of 29 other students. So unless your child is really naughty (always the ones whose names are learned first), then it’ll take a while before the teacher can say much about them other than stock phrases based around assessment outcomes. By the way, since you asked, the order in which I learn names is: naughty, ginger, loud, funny, very high/low ability, tall, the rest. If your child is quiet, well-behaved, with brownish hair and of average height, it’s going to take me a little longer ...</p> <p><strong>What do these ‘levels’ mean and what do they tell me about how my child is doing?</strong></p> <p>Levels were initially supposed to give you an idea of how your child was doing at the end of each key stage. So by the end of primary school, most children were expected to be able to be “working at” level 4, and by the end of year 9, most would reach level 5. These were supposed to be approximations reached by teacher judgment considering all their work over the previous year, and based on reasonable expectations of achievement based on the national profile. They were never intended either to be used to mark individual pieces of work, or to provide some sort of measurement of endlessly rising linear progression. Unfortunately, Ofsted’s limitless demands for numbers on spreadsheets have meant that’s exactly how they ended up being used, which led us to all sorts of bonkers places, such as awarding students “sub-levels” (which don’t actually exist in most subjects in secondary school – we have to make them up), and demanding that most children achieve a level by the end of primary school which the original authors of levels thought would not be achieved by the majority of children even at the end of year 9.</p> <p>Throw in the new performance-related pay system, in which teachers are told their careers depend on ensuring that all children hit inflated “aspirational” targets based on these non-existent sub-levels, and you’ll understand why the abolition of levels last year was one of the few things Michael Gove did which didn’t arouse universal derision. Unfortunately, he didn’t replace levels with anything sensible or useful, but simply instructed schools to make up their own assessment systems. So levels may have been misused and inaccurate, but compared to the smorgasbord of half-baked individual measurement systems on the way, they were the essence of clarity.</p> <p><strong>Why hasn’t my son reached his target level in some subjects, when he works really hard and is very bright?</strong></p> <p>As explained above, targets are often pretty meaningless, and their purpose is more to beat teachers and schools than to help your son. Nevertheless, if there’s an assessment, then the teacher should be able to explain how it was marked, and why the result went one way as opposed to another (whatever measurement system is used). In your case, I’d listen, as given that the teacher’s pay is probably dependent upon your son hitting whatever target has been spat out of the school’s “aspirational” spreadsheets, the fact that he’s still been marked as missing it suggests he has an honest teacher who’ll be able to give you decent feedback.</p> <p><strong>My son is constantly being praised for ‘teaching the other children’ or ‘helping people with their maths’? Is he doing your job for you? </strong></p> <p><strong>Why must my daughter do all this group work? She always gets mixed in with children who can’t be bothered, and she ends up doing all the work.</strong></p> <p>I was a bright kid often asked to help others, and I, too, was peeved at school when I was having to carry the load for the group while Alice fiddled with her hair and Kathryn drew rude pictures on Tom’s book. However, there is a lot of pretty convincing evidence that one of the best ways to secure and improve both knowledge and understanding is not to receive it from others, but to deliver it to others. So in situations where children are helping other children learn, they are almost certainly learning more themselves than if they were passively receiving instruction from the teacher. So, while it may seem annoying at the time, feel free to come back and compare exam results with the freeloaders in a year or two, and see if you’re still miffed about your child having to do the group’s presentation on the similarities between the Stasi and Ofsted on their own.</p> <p><strong> I reported a boy for bullying and although the school seemed to take it seriously I never heard the outcome. Why not? </strong></p> <p>Schools do take bullying very seriously. If unaddressed it can escalate in the classroom, even though much of it now takes place outside school, particularly online. It is a very difficult situation because often it’s a “he-said-she-said” situation with little, or no, hard evidence. Nevertheless, even without evidence, action will usually be taken to reduce contact between protagonists, and a watchful eye will be kept. Remember that just because you didn’t hear about an outcome doesn’t mean there wasn’t one. It’s important to bear in mind that both parties in a bullying situation are children, and often bullying results from a difficult background situation for the bully, and so it wouldn’t be appropriate for the school to share details with the parent of another child. I know that can be frustrating, but the issue to focus on is whether the bullying stops, not whether revenge has been duly visited on the bully.</p> <p>• The writer is a history teacher and blogs under the name of Disappointed Idealist (<a href=\"http://disidealist.wordpress.com/\">http://disidealist.wordpress.com</a>)</p> <h2>Teachers Translated: what they say and what they mean</h2> <p><strong>Primary schools</strong></p> <p><strong>1 ‘So, how do you think she’s settled in?’</strong></p> <p>Parents always react to this as if I were making idle chitchat. But it’s actually important to me and I need an honest response. If your child is showing any signs of unhappiness at all, hopefully there is time for us to get to the bottom of it so that a) we can make her happy again and b) her learning won’t be impeded.</p> <p><strong>2 ‘She’s quite a character’</strong></p> <p>Even the most stone-hearted teacher loves to have lively children in their class, but if a teacher makes this sort of comment it might be that your child is sending out worrying signals. Could she be crying out for attention and, if so, why? Is she parked in front of a screen for most of the time at home to keep her quiet or occupied? If so, it’s little wonder that she may want an audience when that screen isn’t around. While getting laughs from her peers might make her feel good, it won’t help her learning. It might be time to limit the screen time and have a few conversations in which you listen to her.</p> <p><strong>3 ‘I’d like to see him contribute more to class discussion.’</strong></p> <p>Some children genuinely lack self-confidence. If this is the case I’ll tell you so in a heartbeat, and we could discuss a few strategies to build his self-esteem or speaking skills. Some children, on the other hand, don’t lack confidence in class yet for some reason they choose to sit and watch others put up their hands in discussion. If I use this phrase, it’s because he’s a bright kid, and I think he – and the rest of the class – would benefit from him sharing his ideas more readily. It would be great if we could both encourage him to do so, and shower him with praise when he does.</p> <p><strong>4 ‘He needs to take more responsibility for his own learning.’</strong></p> <p>I’m telling you, regretfully, that he’s bone idle. Could it be that he is is too used to having everything done for him at home? If he can’t think for himself, he’ll be in for a major shock at secondary school. He needs to learn responsibility, and fast; a few chores around the house in exchange for his weekly pocket money would be a good way to support this at home.</p> <p><strong>Secondary and FE</strong></p> <p><strong>5. ‘His written work is inconsistent.’ </strong></p> <p>Your son’s arts course isn’t just painting, acting and drama games. He needs to put hard hours in on the theory as well as the practical stuff, because written work will count for just as much when it comes to his final grade. Unless he starts taking this side of things seriously, he’ll end up losing that university place to somebody else who does. It would be great if you could join me in reminding him of this as often as I seem to be doing.</p> <p><strong>6 ‘This subject doesn’t come naturally to him/her …’</strong></p> <p>See also: <strong>‘Needs to apply herself a little bit more.’ </strong></p> <p>To be blunt, he’s going to fail unless he pulls his finger out. We can discuss a variety of intervention strategies and extra revision, but I really need you to limit the X-Box. Coming up with a structured work/play timetable nailed to the fridge at home – particularly in the run-up to exam time – would be a good start.</p> <p><strong>7 </strong>(to child at parents’ evening) <strong>‘How do you think you are getting on?

Photograph: Handout/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>In the 1860s when the Austrian ambassador complained to the home secretary, Sir George Grey, about Karl Marx and other revolutionaries, he received a brief and dismissive reply: “Under our laws, mere discussion of regicide, so long as it does not concern the Queen of England and so long as there is no definite plan, does not constitute sufficient grounds for the arrest of the conspirators.”</p> <p>Not quite what the current home secretary would have replied, I suspect. Theresa May is rushing yet another terrorism bill through parliament. This will place a legal duty on universities to ban radical speakers – “mere discussion” in the words of her Liberal predecessor, who probably also took a more favourable view of being labelled “radical”.</p> <p>Fifty years ago Malcolm X came to speak in Oxford, an episode now recalled to stir the sentimental memories of the university’s alumni. Today, of course, he would never have made it to Oxford; the UK Border Agency would have turned him back at Heathrow. After all even the very silly, but vile, Julien Blanc, the seducers’ guru, has been banned.</p> <p>Malcolm X would probably have fared better in his homeland. The United States remains a nation of laws girded by a constitution, despite police shootings and protest riots. Sadly the United Kingdom is rapidly becoming a nation of ministerial discretion and direction, ever wider administrative powers that would probably have more than satisfied the 19th-century Prussian and Austrian bureaucrats who were so worried about Marx.</p> <p>Under May’s new legislation, universities will have to follow the “guidance” issued by the Home Office. If they fail to follow it, the home secretary will be able to issue them with “directions”. Far from being regarded as institutions in which the most vigorous (and contested) debates should be encouraged, higher education institutions are now to be treated as fertile ground for the “radicalisation” of gullible students by supporters of “extremism”.</p> <p>This is not the first time the government has introduced legislation to require universities to ban “extremist” speakers, although paradoxically the first political intervention back in the 1980s was to stop universities, and student unions, banning rightwing speakers, extremists of another ilk.</p> <p>But this initial, and rather one-sided, libertarianism was quickly succeeded by more authoritarian interventions. Until now, the centrepiece has been the “Prevent” strategy, begun under Labour and revamped by the current government.</p> <p>The 2011 white paper asserted the government’s “absolute commitment to defending freedom of speech”. But, in the very next sentence, it argued that preventing terrorism meant that “extremist (but non-violent) views” had to be “challenged” – by the administrative measures it then outlined. We have travelled a long road from Grey’s reply to the ambassador.</p> <p>There is so much wrong with the new legislation. The key terms such as radicalisation, extremism and terrorism will be defined by politicians who are advised by securitocrats, cowed by tabloid-inflamed public opinion and influenced by electoral advantage.</p> <p>These definitions will not only, and inevitably, be politicised but are also likely to be expandable and open-ended. Those who express their opposition to UK interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Syria, possibly in ill-judged rhetorical language, could well be caught in the net.</p> <p>Mission drift is also inevitable. Previous anti-terrorist legislation has been used to spy on parents who might be mis-reporting their home addresses to get their children into popular schools. Botched, but costly, spying on environmental protesters has also been justified under legislation that clearly had entirely different intentions.</p> <p>But the major objection is two-fold. First, academic freedom, like freedom of speech, is not something to be name-checked and then undermined. It is a fundamental principle, not because ivory-tower dons deserve to be indulged but because free universities are an essential component of a free society. The free expression of even the most detestable views should only be curbed by the most precise necessity – back to Grey’s Whiggish formula.</p> <p>In the case of universities, there is an extra argument. If the war on terror has demonstrated anything, it has shown how little we in the west understand the feelings of others, or know about the countries we have invaded/liberated. To risk curbing that understanding and knowledge by discouraging the engagement and dialogue required by scholars and researchers seems perverse.</p> <p>Second, banning “extremist” speakers is a counsel of despair. It accepts that such views are so seductive that they can only be suppressed. There is no confidence that, in the battle of ideas, values of openness, tolerance and liberty – those much lauded “British” values – will triumph, so we must be closed, intolerant and authoritarian (rather like the extremists we seek to oppose?).</p> <p>Sadly higher education leaders, with their default pro-establishment setting, will not make these arguments – or only behind closed doors.

Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Dear Nicky Morgan</p> <p>In 2011, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-munich-security-conference\" title=\"\">prime minister said</a>: “Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream. We’ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong.”</p> <p>Though David Cameron used the word “state” in front of “multiculturalism”, his speech was widely reported as telling us that it was the bit about living our “different cultures” that had been a disaster. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12371994\" title=\"\">Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC website wrote</a>: “In frank language he made abundantly clear he believes multiculturalism has failed.”</p> <p>At the time, I didn’t hear anyone in government rushing to correct any ambiguity around what the prime minister actually said. The “vision” that teachers should “provide” has turned out to be the “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/michael-gove-british-values-curriculum\" title=\"\">basic British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance for those of different faiths and beliefs</a>”.</p> <p>I guess we’re supposed to lay to one side the fact that these owe plenty to universalist ideas originating in France, the US and the United Nations rather than to something specifically British. The message I get here is that in education, we don’t need to bother about being historically accurate. Or is talking about “values” in a universal way in itself dangerously multicultural?</p> <p>Cameron’s speech came early on in this government. Subsequently, we’ve been offered free schools. People like me have opposed these on the grounds that they get in the way of providing the same educational opportunities to all children and can lead to the absurd situation I heard played out on Radio 4’s Today programme in which a local authority is accused of not intervening in so-called problem schools over which it has no control – as has happened in Tower Hamlets recently. How handy for you that it wasn’t you being grilled by the interviewer. And yet, in your government’s rush to create schools controlled by your office, it’s your office that encourages “state multiculturalism”, which according to Cameron leads to us having “separate lives”, and can result in “Islamist extremism” and “terrorism”.</p> <p>I nipped over to the “<a href=\"http://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/what-are-free-schools/find-a-free-school\" title=\"\">Find a free school near you</a>” page at the New Schools Network site and found more than 30 schools which appear to provide a culturally specific faith ethos, whether that’s dubbed Islamic, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Christian, Church of England or Catholic.</p> <p>I fully concede that this is a guess – and people will correct me if I’m wrong – but I doubt if there are many Muslims in the Jewish schools on this list, nor let’s say, many Catholics in the Hindu schools, or Jews in the Hindu schools … and so on. Doesn’t that encourage people to lead “separate lives”? When people set up free schools with a faith name on the board outside, don’t they tend to give off a signal about who’s welcome to come inside? Why else set them up?</p> <p>I gather that these days, I’m what’s known as “ethnically Jewish”. I could set up an “ethnically Jewish” school, couldn’t I? I could agree to abide by all the conditions on your website; on the board outside my school I could write “The Michael Rosen Ethnically Jewish School”. If I set this up in north London, say, I can imagine that it might attract a few parents.</p> <p>And what would I have achieved? I would have pulled some children out of schools where they had mixed with children of many faiths, no faith, many cultures and mixed cultures. Ofsted would of course pop in to make sure I was teaching “British values” so I would take care to not call them “universal”. Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11253436/Ofsted-rural-schools-failing-to-promote-British-values.html\" title=\"\">as Ofsted have instructed some rural schools recently</a>, I’d have to teach “diversity” even as we were practising the opposite.</p> <p>As I thought some more about my ethnically Jewish school, I wondered what kind of encouragement would the state give me, even though Cameron has warned me of the dangers of this? This time I nipped over to the government’s own website to see what kind of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/326402/201407v3_Single_FA_mainstream_published.pdf\" title=\"\">financial assistance</a> I might expect from your office.</p> <p>Here I learned that: “The secretary of state will pay grants towards recurrent expenditure and may pay grants towards capital expenditure” for my free school. Recurrent expenditure “means any money spent on the establishment, conduct, administration and maintenance” of my school, apart from the  capital expenditure which means expenditure on such things as: “acquiring land and buildings”; and “such other items … of a substantial or enduring nature which the secretary of state agrees are capital expenditure...” This may also include “funding for any other costs to the academy [or free school] which the secretary of state considers necessary”.</p> <p>That’s quite a lot of “encouragement”. Cameron should be told.</p> <p><strong>Yours, Michael Rosen</strong></p>","internalOctopusCode":"9818557","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2200709","internalRevision":"7","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The PM is worried about different cultures living apart from each other, but more free schools of specific faiths isn’t going to help","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Dear Ms Morgan: how do faith schools tackle the problem of ‘separate lives’?","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Michael Rosen","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T07:09:08.676Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/28/1417177821575/Faith-schools-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43yyk","wordcount":"804","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/28/1417177821575/Faith-schools-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"547867c7e4b0c45a9ee684fe","newspaperPageNumber":"42","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T07:09:08Z","standfirst":"The PM is worried about different cultures living apart from each other, but more free schools of specific faiths isn’t going to help","linkText":"Dear Ms Morgan: how do faith schools tackle the problem of ‘separate lives’? | Michael Rosen","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-03T00:03:42.000Z","internalContentCode":"452751518"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/02/faith-schools-not-tackle-problem-separate-lives","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/dec/02/faith-schools-not-tackle-problem-separate-lives","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"e45b98e75effaa0c934931b24bc4281d1207c243","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/28/1417177828331/Faith-schools-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"The Guardian","picdarUrn":"GD*8876122","altText":"Faith schools","caption":"'I could set up an \"ethnically Jewish\" school … And what would I have achieved?

Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>We had all been waiting with dread for the Bristol child sexual exploitation case to end, as it did on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/27/guilty-prostitution-bristol-rape-girls-sex-abuse-somali\" title=\"\">Thursday</a>. The police and local authority had briefed secondary headteachers twice in preparation this term. For those of us who’d been paying attention to the local press, we had read of a large number of men being arrested and charged nearly a year ago. Last week, 13 men were convicted of systematic sexual abuse, and 49 other individuals are now being investigated. But while we’ve been waiting for the trials to end, it has hardly been quiet in our own schools. Child sex exploitation on such a large, organised scale is shocking and rare, but we spend too many of our days working with devastating individual cases that don’t draw as much attention.</p> <p>Every week another child protection case comes to light at my school. Sadly, the children do not always perceive themselves to be victims and therefore referrals to the police can sometimes lead nowhere. A year-9 girl returned from a few weeks’ absence and regaled her PSHE class with details about her work as a prostitute. When we expressed concern, she simply told us not to worry: no one slapped her around; she could look after herself.</p> <p>A year-11 boy in similar circumstances reassured us that men couldn’t be prostitutes, he was just helping his mum with the rent and she knew all about it.</p> <p>These are extreme examples but there are more children being exploited every day. Waiting for Operation Brooke, as it was called, to become public meant everyone would stop and point at Bristol for a while. But it is more complex than that.</p> <p>We were fairly confident that none of our current or ex-students were among the victims in these cases, but in a city as small as Bristol the associations will ripple out to most schools. It could so easily have been one of our children: we can tick off the at-risk factors for so many. We have children who are looked-after and in care. Some of our students attend a pupil referral unit (PRU), where they meet other vulnerable children. Sometimes I need to exclude a student for a fixed period. Parents do not always keep them at home for these days, so where are they? I am very aware that when I make a decision about a child, such as sending them to a PRU, I may risk making that child even more vulnerable. But there are simply not enough alternatives on offer to me as a headteacher.</p> <p>Of course, I always report every incident to the police if appropriate; we also report things to social services. But the thresholds for them to take action are high, and getting higher.</p> <p>Every week I become aware that another of my students has made and distributed an indecent image of a child. Usually it’s a girl who has taken a naked photo of herself and sent it to someone she trusted. The now ex-boyfriend has shown his friends, or her friend has found it and put it on Facebook as a joke. Each time the fallout is incredible for these children, but the police are not really interested. And unless there was coercion involved, social services may not be able to help either.</p> <p>I’ve sat in meetings with parents who have joked it off, said that it is “just one of those things”. I’ve even heard them say: “If Facebook had been around when I was 13, I’d have been doing the same.”</p> <p>There is simply not enough support for my staff to help vulnerable children, let alone try to educate them. Referrals to Early Help can take weeks; a referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) months; educational psychologists are overworked. If something happens and I need some immediate support – imagine a girl is raped, or a boy watches his mother beaten up – it can take for ever. We can offer sympathy, comfort, somewhere to cry, but we are not specialists and I worry that we might do more damage without realising it. It comes down to a few charities helping out as much as they can – and their caseloads are heaving. In Bristol, they will be even heavier now.</p> <p>It’s far too easy to think that all victims are girls in care. But the behaviours they often demonstrate in care may have been learned in abusive families – sometimes they are being prostituted by their own relatives and therefore have an altered concept of what is right and wrong. More needs to be done, far earlier, to prevent such behaviours becoming normal.</p> <p>Taking children away is usually too little too late, and you have to know that the abuse is there. Schools are a universal service, and sustained and robust education could do a great deal. A couple of lessons a year on respectful relationships will do nothing to counter what is happening at home.</p> <p>Even before it finished, the Bristol trial had already created problems. Last week, one of my students reacted violently against a friend who had called her mum a name. The insult about her mother was a racial slur linked directly to Operation Brooke. Just over a year ago this girl’s mum had died; she’d been coerced into prostitution by a boyfriend who’d also introduced her to drugs. The end was tragic.</p> <p>What was I to do about the girl’s outburst? I could internally exclude her – but she was in an internal exclusion when this happened. I called home and her grandmother came to get her. But within an hour, Grandma called to say she had run away to meet friends in town. I’ve no idea how to help this girl – she refuses counselling or any other support. Just as she was settling back into a new kind of normal, this happens.</p> <p>She is not alone. The shocking headlines open old wounds for many children. There are children, and adults, all across Bristol who are reeling this week. Multiply that across Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford …</p> <p>One of the greatest strains on us now in school is a breakdown in race relations. Some parts of Bristol are very multicultural, but other areas – like mine – are steadfastly white and working class. There are EDL flags in windows. Racist language is common, along with sexism and homophobia. We are on a constant crusade to develop inclusivity and tolerance and to combat ingrained rage.</p> <p>Nearly 40% of our families have neither parent working; 15% have never worked; we have twice as many children on free school meals as those who pay. Most of our children have never been into the centre of Bristol, let alone been on a holiday. For many of these children, all of whose consciousness is post-2001, anyone different from them is a terrorist, an illegal immigrant, a job-stealer or a sex attacker. I have spent the last month redoubling our focus on combating racism in preparation for the Operation Brooke verdict.</p> <p>The executive summary in the Rotherham inquiry identified some professionals not wanting to target Asian men as predators for fear of being racist; my own fear about the racist response to Operation Brooke has already been realised. It is perhaps this aspect that is hardest to deal with. The convicted men are, as a point of fact, of Somalian heritage. We know that does not mean that all Somalian men are sex offenders, but some of the children – and some of their parents – are struggling with this. One morning recently, while waiting for his bus to work, one of my teachers was spat at and called a “Paedo”. He doesn’t live that far from the school.</p> <p>Our jobs are already extremely difficult. Every day we are dealing with smaller one-off cases and struggling to keep our heads above water. I don’t have enough staff; I don’t have enough money, or time, or options available to make a difference.</p> <p>We need small off-site units that students can go to for both education and emotional or lifestyle support. I’d like more one-to-one mentors to work with children in school and at home. We need more access to different types of therapies because one size does not fit all. We need more family workers supporting children and parents from an earlier age.</p> <p>Our communities are struggling and a case on this scale simply makes things harder for us all. I dread to think what else is out there.</p> <p>The author is a headteacher in Bristol</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9759882","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2196827","internalRevision":"14","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"After the Bristol case, a local head explains how widespread the issue is and how few resources there are to help affected pupils","allowUgc":"false","headline":"‘Schools can’t cope with the tide of child sexual exploitation’","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"A Bristol headteacher","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T07:30:09.152Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107008142/Child-sex-exploitation-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43gcq","wordcount":"1427","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107008142/Child-sex-exploitation-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f3b62e4b08a4e6205ae5d","newspaperPageNumber":"40","internalStoryPackageCode":"82645","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T07:30:15Z","standfirst":"After the Bristol case, a local head explains how widespread the issue is and how few resources there are to help affected pupils","linkText":"‘Schools can’t cope with the tide of child sexual exploitation’","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-12-03T00:03:42.000Z","internalContentCode":"452363907"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/02/schools-cant-cope-child-sexual-exploitation-schools-bristol-headteacher","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/dec/02/schools-cant-cope-child-sexual-exploitation-schools-bristol-headteacher","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"f4faa7558615e9f7ba5a9122d418682d568d4237","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/27/1417107013430/Child-sex-exploitation-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Alamy","picdarUrn":"GD*48534037","suppliersReference":"ACJ094","altText":"Child sex exploitation","caption":"'Sometimes I need to exclude a student for a fixed period.

It plans to spend a further £75,000 on bus transport and £13,500 on taxis this academic year. The figures are revealed in documents on the school’s website.</p> <p>The school is part of the troubled E-Act chain, which this year was stripped of 10 of its schools following government concerns about standards.</p> <p>The document shows that in the 2012-13 academic year the school spent £20,750, or 8% of its £261,202 pupil premium funding, on transporting pupils by bus, and a further £8,682 on funding for students with “individual transport issues” getting to school, “coach costs for tours of the new academy to ensure smooth transition” and transport costs for a sports day held at Manchester’s Sportcity stadium.</p> <p>The transport funding is a legacy of the academy moving a mile from the site of its predecessor secondary, Grange school, in April 2013.</p> <p>A source close to the school, where 71% of pupils are eligible for pupil premium funding, says the cash should have been spent supporting children directly in the classroom.</p> <p>We do wonder whether the Education Funding Agency, which distributes academy funding, might take a view on whether this is an effective use of the pupil premium.</p> <p>In a statement, E-Act says: “The academy chose to provide daily transport for the most vulnerable students to ensure that punctuality and attendance would remain at a high level. Using pupil premium funding to support that is entirely appropriate.” E-Act also highlights a high recent pupil attendance rate and Ofsted stating that its free schools meals pupils performed well relative to their peers.</p> <h2>Anger over council leak of inspection report</h2> <p>Parents at a primary school in the Thames Valley are furious after a senior council officer publicly released its “special measures” judgment from an Ofsted inspection before the report had been published.</p> <p>Alison Alexander, director of children’s services for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, sent a message detailing the verdict in a “reply to all” response to parents, many of whom have been campaigning to save the school from being forced into academy status. The parents have been copying in journalists and politicians on their emails to Alexander.</p> <p>At the time of Alexander’s email concerning Bisham Church of England primary school, near Marlowe in Buckinghamshire, parents had not been informed of the Ofsted report results. Her email came nearly a week before the official publication. <a href=\"http://www.bucksfreepress.co.uk/news/11602637.Marlow_school_in_special_measures_after__inadequate__Ofsted_controversy/\" title=\"\">The Bucks Free Press ran a story on the verdict the following day</a>.</p> <p>Parent campaigners are now fearful that the school could lose its headteacher of 28 years, Jim Cooke, despite a string of previous good Ofsted reports.</p> <p>Alexander tells us: “The moment the Ofsted report is sent to the school as well as the local authority … it is no longer confidential.” The local authority is now using formal intervention powers to improve standards, she adds, somewhat ominously for the campaigners.</p> <h2>Haringey NUT call off strike action</h2> <p>The National Union of Teachers has called off strike action in Haringey, north London, which arose after the suspension of union rep Julie Davies.</p> <p>To the fury of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2830709/Union-PAYING-teachers-strike-Parents-outrage-NUT-bankrolls-walkouts-official-hasn-t-taught-14-years.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail, which put the story on its front page two weeks ago,</a> two secondary schools were partially closed for three days this month. NUT members had walked out in support of Davies in a dispute over letters sent by groups of secondary and primary headteachers about her work.</p> <p>The secondary heads had suggested their schools would no longer pay for Davies’s working time while she was in post. The union said it would not be told by heads who its representative could be, although the heads denied they were trying to veto NUT members’ choice.</p> <p>Now the NUT says headteachers have agreed to back a proposal that the local schools forum, on which they are represented, would pay into a fund which will continue to support the work of all local union reps, whoever they are. It sounds like relief all round, though we will keep a watching brief on this story.</p> <h2>Ofsted plays down website row with DfE</h2> <p>An impending move to close down Ofsted’s dedicated website provoked a little-noticed row between the inspectorate and the Department for Education, we have discovered.</p> <p>Ofsted is to have all of its online content – including inspection reports on schools across England – transferred to the government’s overarching website, “gov.uk”, by the end of the year.</p> <p>An Ofsted spokesman seemed enthusiastic this month about the move, <a href=\" http://academiesweek.co.uk/no-link-left-behind-for-edu-watchdogs-website-move/\" title=\"\">saying</a>: “The gov.uk portal brings more than 300 public services together under a single web address, making it simpler, clearer and easier for users to find the information they need.”</p> <p>However, minutes of an Ofsted board paper from last December paint a different picture. They say: “Ofsted is currently formally contesting the earlier decision by the Government Digital Service (GDS) not to grant the organisation an exemption from the transition of government digital content to the single gov.uk platform in 2014.”</p> <p>An Ofsted spokeswoman confirmed last week that “initial concerns [from Ofsted] related to the control over content published to the site” but added that the issue had been resolved.</p> <p>She said: “Having sought assurances that Ofsted would retain control over the content published on the site, including all our published reports, we were satisfied that a move to gov.uk would in no way compromise our independence.”</p> <p>Fair enough, but this does look like another behind-the-scenes contretemps between the DfE and the schools watchdog over the latter’s independence, with the two sides at odds a few times this year.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9792261","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2197069","internalRevision":"10","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Oldham school spent £15k on taxis for pupils; anger over inspection report leak; peace breaks out in Haringey and Ofsted plays down website row","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Academy spends pupil premium cash on taxis and buses","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Warwick Mansell","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-25T07:00:06.711Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591702939/Taxi-sign-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43gyp","wordcount":"982","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591702939/Taxi-sign-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f78a1e4b0f48993abc86a","newspaperPageNumber":"39","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T07:00:06Z","standfirst":"Oldham school spent £15k on taxis for pupils; anger over inspection report leak; peace breaks out in Haringey and Ofsted plays down website row","linkText":"Academy spends pupil premium cash on taxis and buses","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-25T07:00:06.711Z","internalContentCode":"452381111"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/25/academy-spends-pupil-premium-funding-buses-taxis","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/25/academy-spends-pupil-premium-funding-buses-taxis","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"149b231f70c37f801ff833cf2ca7ef577e622b06","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416591709630/Taxi-sign-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"The Guardian","picdarUrn":"GD*12090980","altText":"Taxi sign","caption":"The Oldham Academy North plans to spend another £13,500 on taxis for pupils in this school year.

Senior figures say that some vice-chancellors have been choosing to retire early – while others are being pushed. The new business ethos inside higher education means university leaders are expected to deliver results and be able to show it.</p> <p>Their plight will not be met with sympathy from all quarters. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/10/universities-vice-chancellors-ministers-pay-budget-cut\">Ministers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/02/vice-chancellor-wage-increase-angers-students-unions\">rank-and-file academics and students</a> have all expressed anger about escalating “fatcat” salaries for university leaders, against the backdrop of a public sector pay freeze.</p> <p>Prof Michael Shattock, visiting professor of higher education at the Institute of Education and author of a recent book on good university governance, says that university boards are now subjecting management teams to corporate-style appraisals. “Governing bodies are a good deal more forceful than they used to be, and VCs are a lot more vulnerable than in the past,” he says. “A lot of universities are quite unhappy places at the top.”</p> <p>Dr David Palfreyman, bursar of New College Oxford, says: “Vice-chancellors are being unceremoniously dumped, albeit doubtless with golden parachutes, and this fits with them demanding ever more money over the past decade on the alleged basis that they are dynamic CEOs of mega-enterprises.”</p> <p>And Matt Robb – managing director of Parthenon, a management consultancy that has given strategic advice to universities – agrees: “The market is gradually exposing the failings of universities’ business models, and putting them under a lot of pressure. Some vice-chancellors are responding sensibly, and others idiotically. One problem is that few boards really know enough about how universities work to understand the difference.”</p> <p>Political battles within universities are typically fought quietly, but a recent acrimonious dispute between Wendy Purcell, vice-chancellor of Plymouth University, and her then chair of governors, Judge William Taylor, has rocked the university and the city.</p> <p>Purcell was suspended from her £288,000-a-year post by Taylor in July, following complaints about her conduct. The university has declined to release details about the concerns, or the findings of the inquiry that followed her suspension. Meanwhile Taylor resigned at the end of September following allegations of sexual harassment – which he vigorously denies.</p> <p>Purcell returned to the university on 10 November – and in name she remains vice-chancellor. But Plymouth has confirmed that her deputy, Prof David Coslett, will be in charge of running the university as interim chief executive, a role he took on in her absence. Purcell will have a much smaller portfolio, concentrating on external relations and business engagement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0d37d8e96d0c31540d7630ebfffdf1da75487bc\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/21/1416595018774/45f83ab0-33b9-431c-86df-3df9bdc5f72b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wendy Purcell returned to Plymouth University on 10 November but with a much reduced role.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendy Purcell returned to Plymouth University on 10 November but with a much reduced role.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Strikingly, the senior management section of Plymouth’s website no longer includes any mention of Purcell. And senior figures close to the university say that her return is the first stage in a negotiated exit plan. Purcell declined to comment on her change of role.</p> <p>Last week Plymouth’s new chair, James Brent, and Coslett told the Guardian that they were determined to put this conflict behind them. “But that doesn’t mean forgetting about the past,” Coslett says. “We want to learn from our experiences. We will look at our systems of governance and develop and improve them. Our recent experience has made us want to be even more ambitious and an exemplar of good governance for the sector.”</p> <p>Brent, an entrepreneur and chair of Plymouth Argyle football club, says: “It is very important that the organisation has a clear focus on what success looks like. There should be no difference between the board and the executive on that shared view.” He says he is prepared to challenge the senior management team, “but only to improve the organisation”. Both he and Coslett say they are building a new culture of “confidence and trust” in the university. “If it is a relationship of policeman and policed that is not an effective board,” Brent adds.</p> <p>The battle at Plymouth may have been unusually public, but senior academics say this is far from the only example of tensions at the top. The vice-chancellor of one research university says: “If you look at the recent vice-chancellor departures, a lot of them are linked to problems in the institution. In other words, they have been pushed.”</p> <p>There have been some unexpected resignations in recent months, though it is difficult to say if they are due to tensions between boards and their university figureheads. Prof Chris Higgins sparked surprise when he announced in March that he would retire from his £244,000-a-year post as vice-chancellor of Durham University in September. The university, like any forward-looking organisation, he said “needs an injection of new ideas and energy from the top”.</p> <p>In a formal statement at the time the chair of the university council, Robert Gillespie, said that Higgins had told him “some months ago” that he wanted to retire. He confirmed that Higgins would “relinquish all his executive responsibilities” at the end of September, but retain an emeritus role looking after external relations. His deputy has now stepped in as acting vice-chancellor.</p> <p>Last week Southampton University began advertising for a new vice-chancellor. Prof Don Nutbeam announced in July that he intended to retire from the post within two years. Nutbeam is one of the biggest earners in the sector. Last year his salary went up by more than £19,000 to an overall package of £333,000. Other university heads say Southampton has fallen short of its student recruitment targets for the past two years, but a Southampton spokesman said there was no link between the VC’s departure and a shortfall in student numbers: “In a statement to staff and students at the time, the chair of council, Gill Rider, said that Professor Nutbeam’s decision to retire relates directly to his desire to pursue his academic interests in public health.”</p> <p>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, who proudly states that 20% of his salary is performance related, maintains that hard-hitting commercial questions from governors do universities good: “Let’s be honest, although we aren’t just a business, we are a business, and I need help with some of the big commercial issues. The scrutiny of people with a business background is incredibly helpful,” he says.</p> <p>He adds: “Some boards are over-zealous and micromanage. And equally some management teams try to bounce their board by not telling them things. But in my view any failure of a university is a failure of governance.”</p> <p>Chris Sayers, chair of Northumbria University and a former regional director at BT, believes that in this uncertain climate, boards have a more important role than ever. “Money is now following the student and student-number controls are being relaxed. It means if you don’t get the number of students you need, you don’t get your top line revenue, and that is a massive change. This is competition as never before. People who think we can ignore the business side of this are very much mistaken.” </p> <p>Sayers admits that he has had some “challenging conversations” with the vice-chancellor and his team at Northumbria. “But our relationship is based on trust,” he says. “Without it any institution is in big trouble.”</p> <p>He adds: “The relationship between the university board and the executive is a partnership. And any partnership is like a teabag. You don’t know how strong it is until you put it in hot water.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 26 November 2014.

The Liberal Democrat proposal to stop politicians making decisions on the curriculum and assessment is a paler version of a policy I have singularly failed to persuade my own party to adopt for the next general election.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the dividing line between politics and education is in the wrong place. In policy areas such as health, the equivalent of ministers telling teachers how to teach would not happen. To some extent, this is explained by their different approaches to evidence. Education doesn’t have the sort of shared evidence base that is available to medical staff – and politics fills the gap.</p> <p>However, things could be about to change. There is an increasingly powerful voice in education that is calling for a shift in culture from one where ideas seem to re-emerge with a different label every few years to one where we build on evidence of what has gone before.</p> <p>Seeds are being sown; the <a href=\"http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk\" title=\"\">Education Endowment Foundation</a> is spending millions of public money to invest in high-quality research; funding bodies such as the Wellcome Trust and Esmée Fairbairn, universities such as York and Durham, thinktanks such as Nesta are all looking at what might happen if evidence is placed centre stage.</p> <p>Most encouraging of all, teachers are beginning to drive the change. The rapid growth in organisations such as ResearchEd – a grassroots initiative that brings together teachers who want to improve the links with research – shows a thirst to find out what works in the classroom and share it with others.</p> <p>Laws’s idea tries to catch the edge of this revolution but I’m not convinced that he has the right focus or solution. He highlights the curriculum as being the area that should be free from political interference and while I couldn’t defend the constant meddling of recent years, it is a far more complicated than that. The knowledge and skills that children are taught are certainly not a matter just for politicians but neither are they a matter just for teachers, subject experts or universities. We all have a stake.</p> <p>Laws’s solution is to entrust the responsibility to an independent body. Part of the turmoil of recent years has been the constant shift of powers and responsibilities, from government to local authorities to schools to quangos and back again. I can see why an independent body is seen as the answer but the prospect hardly fills me with excitement. Education already has its share of such organisations – Ofqual, Ofsted and the funding agencies, for example, and I’m not convinced that they are seen as significantly different from government.</p> <p>I would focus the debate around where to place the boundary between education and politics on the issue of who decides how teachers should teach – after all, that is what makes the difference.</p> <p>Parties currently have policies on how reading should be taught, whether pupils should be set by ability and even whether teachers should adopt whole-class teaching. Soon, a school’s rating could depend on whether it complies.</p> <p>This is the debate from which politics should be excluded and where the line should be drawn. Pedagogy is becoming a case of opinion and prejudice rather than a decision based on evidence and professional judgment.</p> <p>Although it would be tempting to follow the usual path of giving responsibility for gathering and disseminating evidence to an independent body, we need to be more imaginative. Freedom from unnecessary interference is important, but the users – in this case teachers – need to be able to shape it to meet their needs. The gain might not only be a change in the relationship between politics and education, but for the first time teachers would have access to good quality evidence to inform their decisions. It might have the potential to be a big idea for both politics and education.</p> <p>Estelle Morris is chair of the executive board at the Institute of Effective Education, University of York</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9785715","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2196741","internalRevision":"11","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Instead of political meddling, why don’t we look to rigorous research to decide what works in our classrooms? asks Estelle Morris","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Teaching needs less ideology, and more evidence","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Estelle Morris","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-25T07:10:06.863Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571859915/education-research-006.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43g9y","wordcount":"679","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571859915/education-research-006.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"546f2847e4b0770f491f744e","newspaperPageNumber":"39","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T07:10:07Z","standfirst":"I failed to persuade my own party, but I still believe politicians should not tell teachers how to teach","linkText":"Teaching needs less ideology, and more evidence | Estelle Morris","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-11-25T07:10:07.000Z","internalContentCode":"452356962"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/nov/25/teaching-needs-less-ideology-more-evidence","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/education/2014/nov/25/teaching-needs-less-ideology-more-evidence","sectionName":"Education","elements":[{"id":"669122a631ce5278f0973914ce8a608c87351766","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571865333/education-research-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images","picdarUrn":"GD*3863547","suppliersReference":"200522794-001","altText":"education research","caption":"'The knowledge and skills that children are taught are not a matter just for politicians … we all have a stake in it.'

After five years, if all goes to plan, she will end up with a permanent job. What makes her promotion unusual is that Latham was appointed to the role on a part-time basis only a few weeks after returning to work from maternity leave. “I haven’t seen this kind of prestigious role offered part-time anywhere else,” she says. “Normally if you are looking for a part-time position, you are looking at term-time teaching roles.”</p> <p>Latham is one of the lucky ones. Female academics find it disproportionately difficult to juggle their career and parenthood. Fewer professors, lecturers and researchers at some leading universities are taking maternity leave than in 2010, while at others there has been little or no improvement.</p> <p>If more women were being promoted into staff and senior jobs, the numbers taking maternity leave would rise. Instead they are stagnating, or, worryingly, in some cases, falling. That’s the finding of new research by Education Guardian and comes as figures published on Tuesday reveal a persistent pay gap, the continued dominance of men in senior roles, and very few permanent part-time academic jobs.</p> <p>We surveyed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/02/university-league-tables-2015-the-complete-list\">top 10 institutions</a> in the 2015 Guardian university league table for the numbers of professors, associate professors and lecturers taking maternity leave. In 2010, the average number of academics who took maternity leave at these universities was 14. By 2013 it had dipped slightly to 12. At Cambridge and St Andrews, though, the numbers have fallen more dramatically. While in 2010, 13 Cambridge professors and lecturers went on maternity leave, by 2013 this number had dropped to six. At St Andrews, the number fell from 14 to six in the same period. Is it a statistical blip, or a worrying trend?</p> <p>Women in academia take less time off to have a baby than those in other careers, the research found. The average length of maternity leave at Cambridge and St Andrews, for example, was 187 days and 138 days respectively in 2013. That’s well below the norm: figures from the Department for Work and Pensions suggests the typical length of maternity leave is 273 days. At both universities the length of leave has fallen since 2010. Out of the top 10 institutions in the Guardian league table, six were able to provide data on the length of maternity leave taken by academics. The average was 191 days.</p> <p>“It’s much more difficult for academics to take maternity leave than support staff or administrators in higher education,” says Ellen Pugh, senior policy adviser at the <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk\">Equality Challenge Unit</a>, a charity seeking to improve diversity in higher education.</p> <p>The ECU’s annual data report, published on Tuesday, shows how pervasive the dominance of men in academia still is. More than three times as many men as women hold professorships; there are more than twice as many male department heads and there are still only 35 female vice-chancellors (out of 170), the report found.</p> <p>And then there’s the pay. Whereas the majority of women earned less than £42,000, most men earned more than that. Nearly three-quarters of roles paying more than £57,000 were held by men. Overall, there is a 13.6% median pay gap between male and female academics and it is not closing.</p> <p>Close to two-thirds of full-time academics are men, whereas more than half of part-time academics are women. But many of these part-time roles are either hourly teaching or fixed-term research contracts and maternity pay for these academics is usually a lot less generous, according to figures this year from the Universities and Colleges Union. Only 6.9% of academic senior management roles are part time, the ECU report shows.</p> <p>“A lot of women end up taking poorly paid contracts once they have children, rather than permanent jobs,” says Deborah Sugg Ryan, associate professor of history and theory of design at Falmouth University.</p> <p>These contracts themselves can make taking maternity leave difficult. Fay Davies, now a research fellow in the school of the built environment at Salford University but previously a meteorologist, says it is a particular problem in the sciences. “The contracts are getting shorter and shorter. If you have got a three-year contract you can probably fit in a maternity leave, but if it is only for one year, it makes maternity leave very problematic.”</p> <p>In meteorology, she says: “So many women opt not to have children. Pregnancy is almost seen as unprofessional.”</p> <p>Job shares are even rarer. When Harriet Atkinson’s third child was born in 2012, she was eligible only for statutory maternity pay. On her return to work, Atkinson, now on a part-time lecturer contract at Brighton University, wanted to find a permanent position. “Because a lot of permanent jobs are full time, I tried to apply for a job share. My job share partner and I got to the final interview stage, only to be asked how we would work it if we had to go on a research trip for 10 days at a time. So of course we didn’t get the job as neither of us could juggle that with small children.”</p> <p>But some universities are bucking the trend. Partners Julia Böttcher and Peter Allen are both assistant professors of mathematics at the London School of Economics. The couple, who have two children, are highly unusual in that they applied to work at the university in 2011 as a job share (although they are now treated as separate part-time workers). In addition, they have benefited from the LSE’s generous parental leave system. When their second child was born in May, Böttcher took 18 weeks’ maternity leave at full pay, while Allen is now a few weeks into his 16 weeks’ paternity leave (also at full pay). UCU figures show many universities still pay only the statutory minimum: the first six weeks at 90% pay, then 33 weeks at statutory maternity pay – currently £138.18 a week.</p> <p>“Everyone was very positive and no one complained I was taking so much time off,” says Allen. Böttcher was offered the option to have a reduced teaching load for one semester. Both are also able to do some work from home.</p> <p>Oxford University, meanwhile, has seen the number of professors and associate professors taking maternity leave increase 18% from 2010 levels to 26 in 2013. A spokesman says this is partly because of the generous maternity pay, but also the support given to returning mothers. The university is one of those that offer a phased return following maternity leave, where women may gradually increase their hours. Oxford, like Cambridge, also has a returning carers’ scheme, which allows academic and research staff to apply for cash awards to support their return to work.</p> <p>Changes to how research is assessed should make it easier for female academics to maintain their research ratings, another factor that has hindered longer periods of maternity leave. The Research Assessment Exercise, the last of which took place in 2008, did not take account of any career breaks, but the new Research Excellence Framework, due to report next month, has reduced the research expectations for parents who have taken maternity leave or additional paternity leave beyond two weeks.</p> <p>Some universities compete for the ECU’s <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charter-marks/athena-swan/\">Athena Swan</a> and gender equality <a href=\"http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charter-marks/gender-equality-charter-mark/\">Charter Mark </a>schemes, which promote women’s representation in science and humanities departments respectively. Both schemes take account of how pregnancy, maternity leave and women’s return to work are managed. “We put a lot of effort, not just centrally, but at school level, to make it easy for women to take maternity leave,” says Yvonne Galligan, of Queen’s University Belfast, one of only five silver-level Athena Swan institutions. “The university expects that women going on maternity will be able to take it without worrying that their work will pile up and force them to come back early.”</p> <p>Responding to Cambridge’s maternity leave figures, a spokesman says: “We recognise that there are challenges for many staff when returning from maternity leave and have introduced various policies and initiatives to support the careers of academics.” Cambridge is also an institutional Athena Swan silver award winner.</p> <p>A spokesman for the University of St Andrews says: “These figures are very small and cannot be taken as evidence of a trend; as fluctuations are inevitable in such a small sample. However we are not complacent, and have introduced a single equality outcomes scheme, put in place an equal pay statement, introduced flexible working, and created a female academic networking scheme.”</p> <p>Back at Liverpool, Latham’s boss, Tom Solomon, director of the Institute of Infection and Global Health, says encouraging part-time and flexible working is a no-brainer. “It makes sense. Otherwise you are handicapping half of your workforce,” he says. “You have to create an environment and structures where women can really excel. If you cut people some slack when they need it, then they really appreciate it and more than pay it back.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sian Elvin</em></p> <p><em>• </em>This article was amended on 19 November 2014.

Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>There’s a debacle going on in our schools that no one is talking about – especially not the government. That is wrong, because it will potentially mess up the lives of children turning 16 this academic year. So let’s talk about it.</p> <p>For the past 14 years, if you sat A-levels, your final grade was based on a number of exams taken at different points across your two years of study. If you did badly at one, you could resit. Beyond giving more opportunities for improving grades, this process had two other advantages. First, universities could see the grades so far achieved by a student when they applied for a place. And second, students could drop subjects at the halfway point while still receiving a formal (AS) qualification.</p> <p>From next September, however, the government has decreed that A-levels will return to being a two-year qualification. Exams will all be taken, just once, at the end of the two years’ study. The mid-point AS exams will be stripped out and offered as a standalone qualification.</p> <p>At first, this doesn’t sound too much of a debacle. Won’t sixth forms just offer the standalone AS levels first and then have students sit the full A-level in their second year? Well, no. Because, in its wisdom, the government asked exam boards to make sure the materials don’t easily overlap. Ministers want students to either do the AS or the A-level, but not both.</p> <p>So which do you take? No one knows. Cue debacle. Government sentiment is that the new A-levels are more “rigorous” and universities prefer them. Though given that almost all degree courses are modular, I expect “universities” is more likely to be ministerial shorthand for “my mates who are professors at a couple of Oxbridge colleges”.</p> <p>There were suggestions when the changes were announced that they would reduce the amount of teaching time that was being lost to exams and that they would relieve stress on students. This sudden concern for students’ stress levels seems disingenuous from a party intent on assessing four-year-olds and which had to be talked down from ranking children in their primary school exams. ​​</p> <p>B​esides, it’s not true. Without formal AS ​exams at the end of year 12, sixth forms will ​likely still run mock exams to ensure students are well-practised and can check their progress. As for stress, the one-shot nature of A-level exams​ will likely send student blood pressure skywards.</p> <p>Then there are the practical problems facing schools and colleges with the policy’s implementation. Funding to sixth forms has been cut; they will now receive funds only for three subjects per student. Given the lack of overlap between AS and A-level, it’s likely that only the brightest students would cope with sitting both. Solely offering three A-levels, and ditching AS levels ​entirely, seems the best option to many.</p> <p>This,​ though, comes at a price. Faced with “one shot” exams, students pick safer choices. “Try it for AS, and drop it if it’s too hard” is a common coaxing option in subjects such as maths and foreign languages, in which teenagers often have low confidence despite good skill levels.</p> <p>Cambridge University last week added a further twist when it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29914310\" title=\"\">wrote to schools</a> urging them not just to do A-levels but to enter students for the standalone AS. Its reasoning is sound: without AS grades students will be selected for university places based on less-recent GCSEs, or the notoriously unreliable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/22/half-a-level-grade-predictions-wrong\" title=\"\">predicted grades</a>.</p> <p>Even if schools and colleges can pick their way through the minefield and find a sensible way to deal with this for their students, it’s still likely that the summer of 2017 will culminate in problems. Students will sit all of their new exams at once; exam boards will have to mark them – all at once – and no one has the foggiest how grades will be affected by the newly introduced “rigour”. If it works as it should, grades ought to go down. What does this mean for university offers? No one knows, but a good guess is that students just returning from a gap year, with A-levels already under their belts, will be at a serious advantage over thousands of others now unexpectedly getting lower grades – who will be plunged into the chaotic clearing system to find a university place.</p> <p>The education secretary said in a speech this year that she didn’t believe the government had acted too fast. She wants to <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/98807929855/nicky-morgan-speech-to-conservative-party-conference\" title=\"\">plough on</a> with this “reform”.</p> <p>But with something this half-cooked it has to be worth delaying – even if just for a year. Exam boards still haven’t released their syllabuses, universities don’t know what they want, funding is tumultuous. The only reason for barrelling ahead is because there’s an election next year.

Governors must henceforth, we were told, ensure that schools “actively promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs …”</p> <p>The Friends School Council, which supports Quakers in education, had argued in the consultation that “British values” should be replaced by “human rights” or “international law”, but this view was seemingly not taken on board.</p> <p>At a time when the UK government is sending bombers to the Middle East, we had a weekend to think what the “fundamental British values of democracy” might actually be. Are British values different from French or Swedish ones? How can governors really ascertain the level of our activity in promoting these values, whatever they might be? Can we look at values without seeing how these are translated into action? And should we really promote an unquestioning adherence to the rule of law?</p> <p>As a Quaker, I tend to believe that we should at the very least question the rule of law, and indeed, on occasion, feel compelled to break it. The Quakers’ guide publication Advices And Queries says: “Respect the laws of the state but let your first loyalty be to God’s purposes. If you feel impelled by strong conviction to break the law, search your conscience deeply.”</p> <p>It has been the questioning and challenging of the rule of law that has shaped and developed some of the British values that we are now asked to promote. Acceptance of the law would have meant that slavery remained legal, that homosexuality was a criminal offence and that women were wrong to campaign for universal suffrage.</p> <p>It is not difficult to find modern examples of activity endorsed by the government that would seem to breach the demand that we “encourage respect for democracy” and “further tolerance and harmony between different cultural traditions”. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/uk-firm-sold-teargas-hong-kong-review-sales-policy\" title=\"\">The sale of the teargas used against demonstrators in Hong Kong by UK arms company Chemring is unlikely to be condemned by the government</a>.</p> <p>Indeed, as Sarah Waldron from the Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) said: “Last year’s arms fair in London welcomed some of the most authoritarian regimes in the world and those who profit from their brutality. The deals done here fuel death, injury, fear and repression – yet instead of banning it, the government helps make it happen.”</p> <p>Those who felt impelled to draw attention to this anomaly were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass.</p> <p>At least the new regulation requires governors to encourage respect for other people, “paying particular regard to the protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act 2010”.</p> <p>How does “freedom of speech” – which is surely a British value that all of us could agree is central to our democracy – and the requirement that, in political issues, students “are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views”, sit with this insistence that we not only must enable “pupils to acquire a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in England” but we also must enable them to have respect for those same institutions and services (though not, by the way, for the Welsh or Scottish ones, which are presumably not deemed worthy of respect in our British-value driven culture).</p> <p>Of course we want students’ experiences not to be blighted by bigotry but this authoritarianism – motivated by a fear that multiculturalism has failed in some of our communities – is not a clear or practical way forward.</p> <p>I object from a liberal Quaker perspective to the idea that the individual conscience isn’t valued: am I guilty of brainwashing in expressing this principle to my students? I think that one of Quaker schools’ strengths is that we do not believe we have a monopoly over the truth and actively encourage our students to question authority. This falls far short of the proselytising that the establishment seems to accept from many faith schools, who can demand, for example, church attendance as a condition of admission.</p> <p>I worry that this new legislation sounds like authoritarianism and could be the basis for heresy hunts.</p> <p>At our school we will hold on to some values that are wider than “British” and might look for our inspiration to human rights legislation and international law. Above all, we hope that we can translate some of these values into student action, including the right to protest.</p> <p>Michael Goodwin is headteacher of Sibford school, one of seven independent Quaker schools in the UK and Ireland</p>","internalOctopusCode":"9731635","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-11T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"2188530","internalRevision":"23","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Blind acceptance of the law would mean that slavery was still legal and homosexuality was still a crime, says Quaker school headmaster <strong>Michael Goodwin</strong>","allowUgc":"false","headline":"British values?
