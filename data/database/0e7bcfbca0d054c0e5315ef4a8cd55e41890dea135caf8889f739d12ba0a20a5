Alexis Tsipras’s government is creating a new “political negotiation team”, under junior foreign minister Euclid Tsakalotos, a 55-year-old economics professor. The move may take embattled finance minister Yanis Varoufakis out of the firing line, after eurozone ministers were “highly critical” of recent progress (and lack there of) at last Friday’s meeting in Riga.\nNektaria Stamouli of the Wall Street Journal explains: Greece’s alternate foreign minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, will head a new policy negotiating team, a senior government official said, while the finance ministry’s chief economist will lead talks in Brussels with the heads of the country’s international creditors — a formation known as the Brussels Group. Both people are seen as close allies of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Financial markets have welcomed the news. European stock markets are now positive, and Greek bond yields have fallen; showing a lower danger of default. GREEK 2-YEAR GOVT BOND YIELDS FALL OVER 100 BPS TO DAY’S LOW OF 24.87% - TRADEWEB\nThere’s also a rumour, published by Germany’s Bild, that Greece could bow to pressure and not drop plans to raise the Greek minimum wage back towards pre-crisis levels. The reshuffle came a day after Varoufakis caused a stir by tweeting a quote from Franklin D Roosevelt: “FDR, 1936: ‘they are unanimous in their hate for me; and I welcome their hatred’. A quotation close to my heart (& reality) these days,”.... Last night, the Financial Times reported that Varoufakis could be sidelined after being criticised by fellow finance ministers in Riga on Friday. So fierce was the session that Varoufakis ducked dinner with the rest of the Eurogroup on Friday night.\nOpposition politicians have called for Varoufakis to resign today, blaming his intransigence for the lack of progress towards a reform plan that would persuade lenders to advance some cash soon. Dora Bakoyanni of the opposition New Democracy party urged Varoufakis to fall on his sword: He has to resign today to make things easier for Mr Tsipras and to liberate him so that it doesn’t seem that he is being sacked on the orders of people abroad.” But government insiders say that Tsipras still has confidence in his finance minister. Greece remains under pressure to hurry up and produce credible reforms. A Gemran finance ministry spokesman said the constant delays were “frustrating”, while Italy’s economy minister says the eurozone wants “a rapid accord” that keeps Greece in the euro. Tsipras is also due to speak about the crisis late tonight.\nGreece faces a string of repayments in the next few weeks, including wages and pensions and almost €1bn to the IMF. Analysts at UBS have warned that this could trigger a rapid exit from the eurozone, or a slower one....","title":"Lunchtime summary: Greek reshuffle cheers markets","attributes":{"summary":true,"title":"Lunchtime summary: Greek reshuffle cheers markets"},"published":true,"createdDate":"2015-04-27T12:44:37Z","firstPublishedDate":"2015-04-27T13:25:32Z","publishedDate":"2015-04-27T13:28:56Z","lastModifiedDate":"2015-04-27T13:28:56Z","contributors":[],"createdBy":{"email":"graeme.wearden@guardian.co.uk","firstName":"Graeme","lastName":"Wearden"},"lastModifiedBy":{"email":"graeme.wearden@guardian.co.uk","firstName":"Graeme","lastName":"Wearden"},"elements":[{"type":"text","assets":[],"textTypeData":{"html":"<p><strong>Greece has attempted to breath new life into its stalling talks with its creditors, by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/27/greek-finance-minister-debt-talks-eurozone-live#block-553e0700e4b040bad389a33d\">shaking up its negotiating team</a>.</strong></p> \n<p>Alexis Tsipras’s government is creating a new “political negotiation team”, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/27/greek-finance-minister-debt-talks-eurozone-live#block-553e0c59e4b00521813a8b11\">under junior foreign minister Euclid Tsakalotos</a>, a 55-year-old economics professor.<br /></p> \n<p>The move may take embattled finance minister Yanis Varoufakis out of the firing line, after eurozone ministers were “highly critical” of recent progress (<em>and lack there of</em>) at last Friday’s meeting in Riga.<br /></p>"}},{"type":"tweet","assets":[],"tweetTypeData":{"source":"Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/MxSba/statuses/592642982324604928","id":"592642982324604928","html":"<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Today&#39;s reshuffling of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> negotiating team further sidelines Varoufakis.

Government insiders, though, say Yanis Varoufakis still enjoys the support of PM Alexis Tsipras. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: It has not taken long for the morning TV shows to host politicians calling for Yanis Varoufakis to go. First amongst them this morning was Dora Bakoyannis, the former foreign minister widely seen as the leader-in-waiting at New Democracy, the main opposition party. Bakoyannis told Skai TV that: “He has to resign today to make things easier for Mr Tsipras and to liberate him so that it doesn’t seem that he is being sacked on the orders of people abroad.” Accusing the academic-turned-politician of untrammeled “narcissism” she said the finance minister had not only become an impediment in negotiations with creditors but was endangering the country and the future of all Greeks. Bakoyannis claimed: “I am not at all sure that Mr Varoufakis has not adopted the logic of the drachma....Mr Varoufakis is an impediment for Greece.” Bakoyannis added it was unforgiveable that the outspoken Greek finance minister had elected not to attend Friday’s euro group dinner “but go off with friends instead of trying to negotiate when the country is dependent on these people for loans.” Varoufakis’ removal would enable Tsipras to take what is bound to be the unpopular step of compromising with lenders. Bakoyannis also argued that Varoufakis wouldn’t suffer if he quit political life: “Mr Varoufakis will be alright, he will be able to go on and lecture in universities but does he think of ordinary Greeks who do not have such possibilities?”.

Government insiders, though, say Yanis Varoufakis still enjoys the support of PM Alexis Tsipras. Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: It has not taken long for the morning TV shows to host politicians calling for Yanis Varoufakis to go. First amongst them this morning was Dora Bakoyannis, the former foreign minister widely seen as the leader-in-waiting at New Democracy, the main opposition party. Bakoyannis told Skai TV that: “He has to resign today to make things easier for Mr Tsipras and to liberate him so that it doesn’t seem that he is being sacked on the orders of people abroad.” Accusing the academic-turned-politician of untrammeled “narcissism” she said the finance minister had not only become an impediment in negotiations with creditors but was endangering the country and the future of all Greeks. Bakoyannis claimed: “I am not at all sure that Mr Varoufakis has not adopted the logic of the drachma....Mr Varoufakis is an impediment for Greece.” Bakoyannis added it was unforgiveable that the outspoken Greek finance minister had elected not to attend Friday’s euro group dinner “but go off with friends instead of trying to negotiate when the country is dependent on these people for loans.” Varoufakis’ removal would enable Tsipras to take what is bound to be the unpopular step of compromising with lenders. Bakoyannis also argued that Varoufakis wouldn’t suffer if he quit political life: “Mr Varoufakis will be alright, he will be able to go on and lecture in universities but does he think of ordinary Greeks who do not have such possibilities?”. Despite the uproar, the official line remains that the Greek prime minister is standing by his friend. “If he is let go it will be only once a deal is achieved,” confided one insider. “Varoufakis may not be to everyone’s taste in Syriza,” he said of the governing leftwing party, “but he has managed to internationalise the Greek problem. A lot of good cop, bad cop is being played.

The government would then need to refinance (and probably recapitalise) the banking system by creating a new currency to do so. However, this could probably be slowed with the imposition of capital controls limiting deposit withdrawal.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>(2) The slow(er) route:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government, running out of funds, could substitute IOUs for euros in some of its payments. Starting with payments to suppliers (including for pharmaceuticals, as in 2011), and then - in theory - progressing on to public sector salaries and pensions over time. As current Greek debt obligations are not valued at their face value by the bond market, nor would these notes be, meaning that their purchasing power would likely be lower than that of the euro. In this way, the parallel currency would already be devalued. </p> <p>The more of these notes that were issued, the greater the need would be for the banking system to clear payments in them. The need would also increase for businesses and citizens to use them to pay taxes. As this continued, it would be likely that more euros would leak out of the Greek banking system and the economy would rely on the new currency to a greater extent. </p> <p>Nominally, Greece could (in theory, and just conceivably) remain in the euro under these circumstances, but there would come a point in this process at which it had in a practical sense already left. </p> </blockquote> <p>They’ve also produced a chart, showing the consequences of Greece missing various payments:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a76bee5dd8483ed7d016d4d5d39bc825ef09b073\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430137669654/3bb8324e-802c-442a-bf0e-bdc0489dbc23-460x346.png\" alt=\"Greek default scenarios\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek default scenarios</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UBS</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553e29b3e4b02b6ca8a6373a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T12:22:03.251Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The word in Athens is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/27/greek-finance-minister-debt-talks-eurozone-live#block-553e0700e4b040bad389a33d\">the reshuffled Greek negotiating team</a> will meet tonight, at 6.30pm local time or 4.30pm BST. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/statuses/592663887809482752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> negotiating team is convening at 6.30 pm, according to local media <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politics?src=hash\">#politics</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash\">#economy</a></p>&mdash; Manos Giakoumis (@ManosGiakoumis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManosGiakoumis/status/592663887809482752\">April 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553e2608e4b0f1a3d74a8759\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T12:12:24.881Z\">1.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Life has been continuing as normal in Athens today, despite growing public concerns over the negotiations with creditors. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24bef5b0f364a17d10b9acb1df19f7f291b8c2c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24bef5b0f364a17d10b9acb1df19f7f291b8c2c3/0_111_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man looks at fruits and vegetables at the Athens main market on April 27, 2015.

Encouraged by Messrs Juncker, Draghi, Moscovici and Ms Lagarde, he is playing the game to avoid Grexit. In his post-meeting interviews he said “<em>Any mention of a plan B is profoundly anti-European, My immediate response was to say there is no such plan B, there cannot be such a plan B</em>.” </p> <p>However, the Northerners’ game seems more like avoiding getting the blame for Grexit even if they cannot yet agree a Plan B (because of opposition from those encouraging Mr Varoufakis). The Greeks are still holding out for the last €7.2bn tranche from the second bail-out, no more supervision by the lenders and release from most if not all current budgetary and structural reform targets. Once that is out the way, they then will want to talk about a third bail-out.</p> <p>The current stand-off probably means the first crunch date is May 12<sup>th</sup> when a €0.75bn repayment is due to the IMF. Things would move quickly after a default but the exact sequence is unclear. Assuming the Northerners refuse to blink, drachmas would soon be needed to pay suppliers, salaries and pensions. This in turn would necessitate nationalising the banks and introducing exchange controls. Mr Draghi’s nightmare will have come true: EMU would be seen not to be irreversible after all. Then it will be Mr Juncker’s turn: will Greece be able to stay in the EU?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlastairWinter/statuses/592607854873464833\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Wonder if circumventing Varoufakis just another instalment in Northerners trying to escape blame for Grexit while Greece trying to avoid it?</p>&mdash; Alastair Winter (@AlastairWinter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlastairWinter/status/592607854873464833\">April 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553df7cae4b006cad0a26a5b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T08:49:27.310Z\">9.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good news for readers whose grasp of Greek is as poor as mine; Enikos will translating Alexis Tsipras’s interview tonight into English (from 9.30pm UK time, I think)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/enikos_en/statuses/592610027632009216\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/graemewearden\">@graemewearden</a> Simultaneous translation into English for Alexis <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tsipras?src=hash\">#Tsipras</a> first live interview -<a href=\"http://t.co/0PrAT10q83\">http://t.co/0PrAT10q83</a></p>&mdash; enikos_en (@enikos_en) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/enikos_en/status/592610027632009216\">April 27, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-553df445e4b040bad389a328\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-27T08:42:56.178Z\">9.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"06f3229694c218f6ab1918f046c6a8b9df77a2e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06f3229694c218f6ab1918f046c6a8b9df77a2e6/2_234_3280_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"epa04718854 President of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem attends the press conference of the Informal Meeting of Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) in Riga, Latvia, 24 April 2015.
