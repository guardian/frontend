        "body":"<p>Peyton Manning spent all afternoon putting the Broncos in the end zone during a wild shootout with Tony Romo and the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>The last time he got the ball, though, Manning kept Denver out of the end zone and that was the best way to win the game.</p><p>The four-time MVP kept up his record pace for touchdown passes, Matt Prater kicked a 28-yard field goal as time expired after an interception by Romo spoiled the first 500-yard game in Dallas history, and the Broncos remained unbeaten with a 51-48 victory Sunday.</p><p>\"It was pretty amazing that it came down to the defense making a big play at the end,\" Denver coach John Fox said. \"Thank God our offense kept us in the game all day long.\"</p><p>In the waning seconds of one of the highest-scoring thrillers in NFL history, Manning ensured that his kicker not Romo had the last chance to score.</p><p>And with that, the Broncos ran their total to 230 points this season the most by an NFL team through the first five games.</p><p>The Broncos (5-0) had moved the ball to the Dallas 2 after Danny Trevathan's diving interception at the 24 in the final 2 minutes. Needing a first down but not a touchdown so they could run out the clock, Manning and Knowshon Moreno shouted at each other in the backfield just before the snap.</p><p>\"He basically was asking me, 'How am I supposed to do that? How can I get a half a yard but not get a yard and a half?'\" said Manning, who threw for 414 yards and four touchdowns to give him a record-setting 20 in the first five games. \"I just said, 'You can't! You can't score! You can't do it!'\"</p><p>Moreno managed to pull off the first down without scoring, and Manning took three snaps to drain the clock to 2 seconds for Prater, who also had a 50-yarder among his three field goals.</p><p>It was quite a debate over a measly yard in a game with 1,039 yards of total offense combined in the fourth-highest scoring game in NFL history and tied for the second-highest in regulation since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.</p><p>Romo was 25 of 36 for 506 yards and five touchdowns, breaking Don Meredith's club record of 460 yards. He is the fifth quarterback in NFL history to pass for at least 500 yards and five touchdowns in a game.</p><p>Manning, who threw for 414 yards and moved past Dan Marino for second on the career passing list with 61,371 yards, answered by leading a nine-play, 73-yard drive to Moreno's tying 1-yard score with 2:44 remaining.</p><p>Romo's interception came two plays later, when Trevathan dived in front of tight end Gavin Escobar.</p><p>The Cowboys (2-3) were on the verge of getting blown out early in the second half when they finally stopped Manning and forced a field goal. They later ended his streak of 227 passes without an interception when Morris Claiborne picked him off late in the third quarter.</p><p>In other games, Andrew Luck threw two touchdown passes and Donald Brown scored the go-ahead TD with 8:55 to go in the Colts 34-28 win over the Seahawks, and the New Orleans Saints remained unbeaten with a 26-18 victory at Chicago with Drew Brees throwing two touchdown passes to Pierre Thomas and Jimmy Graham equaling an NFL record with another 100-yard game.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Bengals beat the Patriots 13-6 with BenJarvus Green-Ellis running 1 yard in the fourth quarter for the game's only touchdown, the Chiefs had a 26-17 win over the Titans to maintain their best start to a season since 2003, the Ravens edged the Dolphins 26-23, the Packers had a 22-9 win over the Lions and Philadelphia kept the Giants winless with a 36-21 result at East Rutherford.</p><p>At Glendale, Arizona the Cardinals had a 22-6 win over the Panthers and, at St. Louis, the Rams beat the winless Jaguars 34-20 with Sam Bradford throwing three touchdown passes.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/nfl-clockwatch-week-five-live\">NFL Clockwatch: Week Five - as it happened</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419211854|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7276eaedb2ee34e05246c1cfabfa52068a78b10c -->",

The main part of this blog is now over, but we will continue to post the final scores from the later games as the day goes on. For now I can tell you that the latest from the two games in action is:</p> <p><strong>Denver Broncos 0-7 Dallas Cowboys</strong></p> <p><strong>Carolina Panthers 3-0 Arizona Cardinals.</strong></p> <p>Don’t forget to check back in again on Tuesday for our Five Things We Learned look back over all the weekend’s action. In the meantime the comments section of this blog will remain open for you to discuss the games as they unfold.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251cd44e4b04e5d3aefa94d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:51:35.368+01:00\">4.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Quick takes</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A few immediate thoughts on those early games:</p> <p>&nbsp;- We started the day with five unbeaten teams, and already we are down to three – pending the result of the Denver Broncos’ game against Dallas. I wouldn’t worry too much for the Seahawks, who were playing on the road for the second time in as many weeks, and held their own for most of the game in Indy. It took a blocked field goal, returned for a touchdown, to spark the Colts to life, and they still only won by six. The Patriots, on the other hand, continued to struggle in the passing game even with Danny Amendola back – so much so, in fact, that Brady’s string of 52 consecutive games with a passing TD came to an end. They’ll have Rob Gronkowski back soon, which should be a huge help, but could the problems run deeper? Perhaps not – after all, this Bengals defense happens to be very good.</p> <p>&nbsp;- Something is not right with Eli Manning. Three interceptions for the day brings his total for the season to 12. It doesn’t help that the running game is failing so catastrophically, of course, but the Giants twice had a lead in this game and need to make better decisions. It’s not like the Eagles defense was playing all that well through the first four games, either.</p> <p>&nbsp;- Kansas City are 5-0. I feel like we say this every week but really, who saw this coming?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251cacde4b04e5d3aefa94c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:41:07.782+01:00\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fantasy Football update</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So, who were the stars of those early games? Here are a few of the stand-out performances:</p> <p>&nbsp;- Alishon Jeffery: 10 receptions for 218 yards, 1 TD</p> <p>- TY Hilton: 5 receptions for 140 yards, 2 TDs</p> <p>- Russell Wilson: 15/31 passes completed for 210 yards, 2 TDs and 1 INT; 13 carries for 102 yards.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c9d0e4b0a0aedf83d94a\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:37:01.238+01:00\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Around the league: final scores</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>OK, all the 1pm ET kickoffs are now finished.

The Eagles might only be 2-3, but in a miserable NFC East, that is enough for them to maintain hopes yet of a division title. The Giants, at 0-5, look done.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c87ee4b04e5d3aefa94b\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:30:59.354+01:00\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Chiefs 26-17 Titans</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The Seahawks’ perfect start might be over, but the Chiefs stay undefeated with a hard-earned win in Tennessee. They had fallen behind early in the fourth quarter, but responded with 13 unanswered points to close out the game. Not only are Andy Reid’s team good, they appear to be pretty resilient, too.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c7dbe4b04e5d3aefa94a\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:28:21.731+01:00\">4.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Final score: Seattle Seahawks 28-34 Indianapolis Colts</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And it’s all over in Indianapolis, where Russell Wilson is intercepted by Darius Butler on fourth-and-15 at the Seattle 37, before the Andrew Luck kneels to close out the game. It was quite the shoot-out in the end between the two second-year quarterbacks, and if you leave aside that pick, there was not a lot to choose between them. Wilson finished with 15 completions from 31 attempts for 210 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. Luck had 16 completions on 29 attempts for 229 yards and 2 TDs with no picks. But Wilson also rushed for 102 yards on 13 carries.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-5251c6bee4b04e5d3aefa948\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T21:23:36.155+01:00\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Field goal!

Not good news for a Lions team that has not won at Lambeau Field since 1991.</p> <p>- <strong>Rob Gronkowski </strong>will not make his season debut for the Patriots against Cincinnati, having been kept on the inactive list for another week. But <strong>Danny Amendola</strong> will start - providing a major boost to a passing offense that has stuttered despite finding ways to get the job done over the last few weeks. </p> <p>- <strong>Cameron Wake</strong> is listed as active for Miami, meaning good things for the Dolphins' pass rush and bad things for Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco - who is without receivers <strong>Jacoby Jones</strong> and <strong>Marlon Brown</strong>, as well as the recently acquired offensive tackle <strong>Eugene Moore</strong> - all of whom have been ruled out. </p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52518eafe4b0a0aedf83d91c\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T17:26:29.932+01:00\">12.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pick Six predictions game</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>A quick reminder to those of you taking part in our Pick Six competition to make sure you get your predictions in for this week's games. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/04/nfl-talkboard-week-five-russell-wilson-andrew-luck?CMP=twt_gu\">Post them in the comments section of the NFL Talkboard</a> - we will not count any picks made on this blog.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52518c6be4b01e4020f8d8e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-06T17:16:26.732+01:00\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">ET</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">Perfection</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The 1972 Miami Dolphins won’t be losing any sleep just yet, but one month into the NFL season a good five teams are still yet to taste defeat. All of them are in action today. According to NFL Network’s GameDay Morning team, this is the first time since 1968 that so many 4-0 teams have been in action on the same afternoon.</p> <p>Four of them – the Saints, Patriots, Chiefs and Seahawks – will be kicking off within the next 45 minutes. And I’ll be here to keep you posted on how they, and everybody else, get on. Here’s the full list of today’s 1pm ET/6pm BST games:</p> <p><strong>New Orleans Saints @ Chicago Bears</strong></p> <p><strong>New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p> <p><strong>Detroit Lions @ Green Bay Packers </strong></p> <p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs @ Tennessee Titans</strong></p> <p><strong>Seattle Seahawks @ Indianapolis Colts</strong></p> <p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars @ St Louis Rams</strong></p> <p><strong>Baltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins</strong></p> <p><strong>Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants</strong></p> <p>So, will our perfect foursome emerge from their respective games unscathed? Who will come out on top in the duel between second-year quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson in Indianapolis? And exactly how many points will the Jacksonville Jaguars lose by this week?

        "headline":"How an NFL money-spinner could turn into a white elephant",
        "body":"<p>A few years ago, I went to a New York Yankees baseball game with the author and pop-culture guru Malcolm Gladwell. It was a hot ticket&nbsp;– a grudge match against the Boston Red Sox – but we arrived late, left before the end and spent most of the evening eating snacks. This, Gladwell explained, was how most Americans watched the sport.</p><p>\"Baseball's a great idea, a great story, but it's pretty terrible to watch it live,\" he said, as we sat on the bleachers behind third base. \"Frankly, I prefer to read about it, the way the game is played in my imagination.\" Warming to the subject, he digressed on to other sports: \"Take NFL, I would say that is A-plus televised, B-minus live. Basketball is B-plus televised, A live. Ice hockey: C-minus televised, A-plus live. And golf, that's A televised, but something like D live.\"</p><p>I was reminded of this sliding scale when I attended my first NFL game, at Wembley last October. The match was between the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/28/st-louis-rams-new-england-patriots-london-live\" title=\"\">St Louis Rams and New England Patriots</a> and it was a washout both figuratively and literally: the underdog Rams scored in the opening exchanges but were then pounded by 45 unanswered points. The rain was relentless, dampening everyone's spirits except the irrepressible cheerleaders, who may have required treatment for hypothermia at the game's end. There were 84,005 spectators, but it's always a dire sign when the organisers have to instruct an audience to \"make some noise\". (Tip: sports crowds, typically, are pretty experienced at making that judgment for themselves.)</p><p>Of course, this was just one game – though, curiously, it does always seem to bucket down when the NFL comes to London, which is either pathetic fallacy or just proof that it tends to rain quite a lot in England at this time of year. But the experience did make me think about what I <em>do</em> like about American football, a sport that I have followed with growing and personally unfathomable interest for the past four or so years.</p><p>The weekend for British NFL fans starts on Sunday late afternoon, just as Super Sunday football winds down on Sky Sports. You switch channels, hunker a little deeper in the sofa and you are greeted by two old, dear friends Kev and Neil – Cadle and Reynolds, respectively, if you want to be formal. Ideally the lantern-jawed, power-dressing ex-quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt will be sandwiched between them, but really there's no chaff in a rotating lineup of guest summarisers. You can almost smell the coffee on their breath as they prepare for eight hours of witching-hour live broadcasting.</p><p>Not only is it the perfect, brain-neutral wind-down to the weekend, but there is immediately an exoticism that our own homegrown sports struggle to match. From Sky HQ in Isleworth, Hounslow borders, we zip across the pond to Baltimore, Pittsburgh or Green Bay. These are not America's loveliest cities, I'm informed, but the pictures always make them seem so vibrant and glamorous. Even romantic, especially when it's snowing. (Second tip: for the fastest way to work out how cold it is, check where the Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, has sawn off the sleeves of his sweatshirt this week.)</p><p>This was an issue for me when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/29/minnesota-vikings-pittsburgh-steelers-nfl\" title=\"\">NFL came to Wembley</a>: the players were here, the cheerleaders were present; my match even had Belichick and his legendary sweatshirt, though he may have swapped it for a rain jacket. But I didn't want American football in London; I wanted it in America.</p><p>The NFL, naturally, doesn't especially care what I want. Its aim – set out by the commissioner Roger Goodell – is to turn a business that currently generates $10bn into one that brings in $25bn by 2027. The market is pretty well saturated in the States, which means that at least some of the new sources of income will have to come from overseas.</p><p>America has a very efficient strike rate at exporting the things it likes to the rest of the world. We eat its fast food, guzzle its soft drinks, listen to its music, watch its films and series-link its TV shows. And yet, overwhelmingly, we can take or leave its sports. The NFL made its first excursion to Japan in 1976 and has taken 13 trips there since, but has never been fully adopted. It has also played pre- and regular-season games in Mexico City, Sydney and Gothenburg.</p><p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/28/london-nfl-franchise-minnesota-pittsburgh\" title=\"\">it is Britain that is felt to have the greatest commercial promise</a>. The NFL estimates there are two million \"avid\" supporters over here and it seems hell-bent on making London its first overseas franchise. Perhaps Jacksonville Jaguars will make the jump: the Florida-based team – currently winless and on course to record a historically awful season – play the San Francisco 49ers at Wembley on 27 October and will return to London for each of the next three seasons.</p><p></p><p>There are lots of reasons why this might not happen. It would be expensive, logistically complicated and potentially unpopular with players and fans in the States. Not to mention incongruous – isn't it a bit odd to have an NFL franchise in London and not in Los Angeles? Over here, I would worry that the new team could become one of sport's biggest white elephants.</p><p>It is one thing to sell 80,000 tickets once or twice a year, but how many people would, like me, go for the novelty and then never return? After all, with seats costing between £35 and £160, that's a lot of money to drop on a sport that is B-minus live and A-plus at home on television.</p><p></p><p><em>Tim Lewis's book on the Rwandan cycling team, Land of Second Chances, is out now</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419096000|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2b5d827a7f7d88cc7fb6957b21120041423f0279 -->",

        "body":"<p>President Barack Obama has weighed into the controversy surrounding the name of Washington's NFL football team. The name has faced a new barrage of criticism for being offensive to Native Americans.</p><p>Speaking to the Associated Press in an interview published on Saturday morning, Obama said: \"If I were the owner of the team and I knew that the name of my team, even if they've had a storied history, that was offending a sizable group of people, I'd think about changing it.\"</p><p>A number of media organisations have recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/sep/09/washington-redskins-us-press-publishing\">stopped using the \"Redskins\" name</a>, in recognition of opposition to its use among Native American groups which has recently been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/13/washington-redskins-protest-green-bay-packers-oneida-indian-nation\">expressed at demonstrations</a> at NFL games and elsewhere.</p><p>Washington's owner, Daniel Snyder, has said repeatedly that he will not change the team's name. In May, he told USA Today: \"We'll never change the name. It's that simple. NEVER – you can use caps.\"</p><p>Last month Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, said: \"If one person's offended, we have to listen. And ultimately, it is Dan [Snyder]'s decision. But it is something that I want all of us to go out and make sure we're listening to our fans, listening to people who have a different view, and making sure that we continue to do what's right.\"</p><p>Obama has addressed controversial issues within football before. In January, discussing the effects of head injuries sustained in the sport, he said that though he was a fan he was not sure that <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8886528/president-barack-obama-not-sure-allow-son-play-football\">if he had a son, he would allow him to play</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419140918|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|3f01ea9e1b2a0b5f4bc8d1ab8c3561a329b2ff77 -->",

Photograph: Peter Morrison/AP</figcaption></figure><p>The rise and fall of Lawrie Sanchez and the men from Northern Ireland is one of those beautifully understated underdog stories. To the outsiders, Northern Ireland remained the same under Sanchez; they were still a lowly international team that couldn't qualify for a major championship. But, to the insiders, these were heady days indeed.</p><p>Ask any Northern Ireland fan for memories of the past decade and three moments will stand out: England, Spain and Sweden. Qualifying for Euro 2008 would have been incredible, but these nights will be savoured for generations. </p><p>To support Northern Ireland is to expect nothing and appreciate everything: when Sanchez took the job, his first aim was to score a goal. The team had gone 28 months and 1,273 minutes without one, so David Healy's subsequent scoring streak felt like a miracle. That he has scratched around the English and Scottish leagues looking for a place to call his home only confirms that something magical was taking place on those night at Windsor Park.</p><p>As <strong>Jon Naylor</strong> puts it in this article for <strong>In Bed With Maradona</strong>, this was a \"renaissance the likes of which Michelangelo would have been proud\". It wasn't about winning trophies or even being in the tournaments where they could have won trophies. It was about taking on some of the best teams in the world and giving them a game. Perhaps their friends across the water would enjoy their own national team a little more if they could learn the art of lowered expectations.  </p><h2>Other stories we like</h2><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9730546/quite-rush\">2) Quite a Rush</a></strong></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419055934'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/8/30/1377862765002/Chris-Hemsworth-and-Danie-023.jpg' alt='Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl in Ron Howard's Rush' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Chris Hemsworth as James Hunt and Daniel Brühl as Niki Lauda in Rush.

He watched Rush, the new film about the 1976 Formula One season and the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and then he flicked on the TV and switched between his favourite basketball movie, Hoosiers, and his favourite American football movie, The Longest Yard. <strong>Grantland</strong> readers are the recipients of Simmons' good fortune. Inspired by this triology, he has written an ode to his favourite sports movies. Great moments are born from great opportunity.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/sport/rooney-ponders-the-nature-of-happiness-2013091979626\">3) Wayne Rooney ponders the nature of happiness</a></strong></p><p>When Wayne Rooney was slightly tetchy to an interviewer after Manchester United's match against Bayer Leverkusen, the football world erupted. Spotting an opportunity to ridicule the pantomime theatricality of it all, the <strong>Daily Beast</strong> waded in with a parody: \"When asked if he was happy at with his current club, Rooney speculated on whether man can ever truly be happy when he knows the only certainties are death and United winning a penalty when they play at Old Trafford.\" </p><p>Needless to say, one of the older heads gave Rooney the arm-around-the-shoulder treatment and helped him through his mental crisis: \"Veteran player Bryan Robson said: 'What Wayne needs to do is focus on the game, give 110 per cent and leave the question of whether he's a man dreaming he's a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he's a man until after the match, or preferably the close season.'\"</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2013/09/slow_getting_up_excerpt_nate_jackson_explains_why_he_took_hgh_at_the_end.html\">4) Nate Jackson: Why I took human growth hormone</a></strong></p><p>From this excerpt in <strong>Slate</strong>, it looks like <strong>Nate Jackson</strong> has written an autobiography worth reading. Jackson comes across as intelligent and sympathetic as he explains why he took human growth hormone towards the end of his career.</p><p>Jackson was on the way out and no longer his own body. His hamstring was shot and he had just left the Broncos, the place he had called his home: \"When I came to Denver, I came alone. All players do in one way or another. The Bronco organisation was my lifeline. They were very good to me. I love them. I want to tell them how I feel about my time there. But I don't have the words. I sit down in my locker for the last time. It was always a bit out of sorts, full of clothes and shoes and tape and gloves, notebooks and letters and gifts. Do I even want these cleats? These gloves? These memories? Yes. I fill up my box. Six years as a Denver Bronco. Six more than most people can say. Still feels like a failure, though. So this is how the end feels? Standing in an empty locker room with a box in my hand? Yep. Now leave.\" </p><p>The loneliness of the ageing sportsman comes through in every word. As concerns about his future turn to fear, and then to desperation, Jackson reaches out to a \"connection\" and buys a year's supply of hormones: \"The drugs come in the mail in a package stuffed with dry ice. I half expect to see the feds storm out of the bushes, guns blazing, as I pull the box off my front porch. But no feds. Just me and another needle. It comes with very little guidance as to the quantity and regularity of the shot. I have a conversation with my supplier and he tells me how to do it. Other than that I'm on my own. I will tell no one what I'm doing.\"</p><p>In the end, Jackson says the hormones did not agree with him. They were not affecting his body, he was paranoid about being caught and realised that, if he was going to ressurect his career, he'd rather do it on his own strength: \"If I am going to play football again, I'll do it clean,\" he writes. His account may or may not be accurate, but the writing is golden. </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://twohundredpercent.net/?p=24102\">5) Melancholy in Derby over the departure of Nigel Clough </a></strong></p><p>Forty-six years ago Tim Ward left his job as Derby County manager, complaining about a lack of resources: \"The job has been the toughest I have ever had, and the shortage of money has been frustrating. The trouble with this club is that you can't put a threepenny stamp on a letter without consulting the board personally. I was told that money was available but I could never get an answer when I asked how much.\" </p><p>Ward moved to Carlisle United and a young Brian Clough came it at Derby. Now, 46 years later, Clough's son Nigel has left Derby after struggling to compete with richer clubs. Clough didn't have to consult the board over threepenny stamps, but Ward didn't have to worry about Premier League parachute payments. As <strong>Ian King</strong> of the football website <strong>200%</strong> points out, Clough left Derby towards the middle of the Championship table, just about where they ought to be after nine league games. </p><p>Clough's sacking, much like his father's run with Derby from the Second Division to the European Cup, says a lot about the eras in which they operated: \"Clough becomes the 50th out of the 92 managers in the Premier League and Football League to lose his job in the last 12 months and, whilst this season has not become quite as insane as last season was in this respect just yet (although few would rule out the possibility of this position changing as summer continues to turn to autumn), this is a statistic that still jumps out as a sad indictment of the short-termism that blights the game in this country at the moment. Clough was, somewhat remarkably, the fourth longest-serving manager of this 92.\"</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2013/09/free-mojo-a-football-fable.html\">6) Free MoJo: A football fable </a></strong></p><p>In this intriguing \"fable\" in <strong>The New Yorker</strong>, <strong>Ian Crouch</strong> looks at the fairness of the college system in American football. By taking the life of Morgan Jones, a hypothetical hot-shot who wants to eschew college on his way to the NFL, Crouch questions the system in place for young footballers. Should an 18-year-old who could cut it against the big boys be held back from the riches he deserves?</p><p><strong><a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/sports/soccer/a-tough-choice-play-for-brazil-or-spain.html\">7) A tough choice: play for Brazil or Spain?</a></strong></p><p>Some people have all the luck. Take Diego da Silva Costa, the 24-year-old Atlético Madrid striker profiled by <strong>Rob Hughes</strong> in this article for the <strong>New York Times</strong>. Costa scored Atlético's winning goal last Saturday night when they beat Real Madrid in the league for the first time since 1999. He also has the advantage of being eligible for both Brazil and Spain, the two favourites for next summer's World Cup. Choose wisely Diego. </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.telegram.com/article/20130929/COLUMN01/309299933\">8) Of years of love, and a long goodbye</a></strong></p><p>This column rarely features the <strong>Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette</strong>, but <strong>Dianne Williamson</strong>'s interview with Bob Cousy, the retired NBA star, demanded inclusion. Cousy doesn't go into detail about his time with the Boston Celtics, but is happy to talk about his late wife, who died last month: \"Our marriage was somewhat contrary to tradition,\" he said. \"Most couples have the most intensity in the beginning. But I was always working. So we had the best and most romantic part of our marriage at the end. We literally held hands for the last 20 years.\"</p><p>Cousy cared for his wife for the last decade of her life. \"She would ask him the same question, over and over,\" writes Williamson. \"She hallucinated, grew disoriented and struggled with balance. But she always knew her husband, and she bristled at any suggestion that she suffered from dementia. So Cousy worked hard to create the perception that his once-independent wife was vital and healthy. Because she believed she could still drive, he shipped her station wagon to their place in Florida each winter so she could see it in the driveway. Artificial red flowers were planted in her garden. He did all the household chores and let her think she performed them herself.\" Whatever Cousy did on a basketball court does not compare to the love he showed his wife.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/62279188/\">9) The Super Bowl curse is real</a></strong></p><p><strong>Brian Tuohy</strong> of <strong>Sports On Earth</strong> makes quick work of dismissing the \"Madden Curse\" and \"the Curse of the Bambino\". But he can't quite explain the curious case of the \"Super Bowl curse\" – the strange \"coincidence\" by which no host city has seen their hometown team play in the Super Bowl in their own stadium: \"Had I written this in 1977, you might not think this was even worth mentioning But this is 2013, and as Super Bowl XLVIII approaches, it appears as if New York/New Jersey won't see either the 0-4 Giants or the 2-2 Jets manage to break this long, strange streak that has persisted for nearly five decades.\" </p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/magazine/searching-for-bobby-ryan/\">10) The secret life of Bobby Ryan</a></strong></p><p>Bobby Ryan, who plays for the Ottawa Senators in the NHL, takes a three-hour drive to Toronto every Monday morning to see his therapist. His is not a normal story. It involves the FBI, forged identities, family struggles and eventual redemption. <strong>Gare Joyce</strong> tells all for <strong>Sportsnet</strong>.</p><h2>This week on the Guardian Sport Network</h2><p>1) <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/football-cliches/2013/sep/27/how-to-be-a-co-commentator\">How to be a football co-commentator</a></strong></p><p>2) <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2013/oct/01/premier-league-tactical-talking-point-sport-network\">Premier League: player, team and tactical talking point of the week</a></strong></p><p>3) <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2013/oct/03/alan-miller-marvin-hagler-1980-boxing-low-point\">Remembering Minter v Hagler: one of boxing's lowest moments</a></strong></p><p>4) <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/99-94-cricket-blog/2013/sep/30/county-cricket-week-final-over-season\">County cricket: the week's final over</a></strong></p><p>5) <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket-the-old-batsman-blog/2013/oct/02/speed-fast-ball-eye-beholder\"> The speed of a cricket ball is in the eye of the batsman</a></strong></p><p><strong>Debate the articles and share your own suggestions below</strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418867755|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0eb16a124a6fac55b189c431b5fde0dfa16729ca -->",

        "headline":"NFL Talkboard: Week Five",
        "body":"<p>It might feel as though the NFL season has only just begun, but the truth is that most teams are already a quarter of the way through their regular season. Time is running out for the slow starters to rescue their playoff hopes. Likewise, contestants in our Pick Six competition should know that they cannot afford to let the front-runners get out of sight. </p><p>That was a lesson heeded by our very own Australian sports editor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz\">Tom Lutz</a>, who was the only person in a field of nearly 300 people to get all six picks correct last week. I trust that you will all join me in offering him a <del>begrudging and slightly bitter</del> highly enthusiastic round of applause. </p><p>Before we get on to this week's picks, I should include the customary reminder that we will be live blogging this weekend's action in our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/29/nfl-clockwatch-steelers-vs-vikings-london-special-live-wembley\">NFL Clockwatch</a> from 1pm ET/6pm BST. We will have the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/nfl-five-things-learned\"> Five Things We Learned</a> round-up on Tuesday, too.</p><p>And now it's time for your feature attraction:  </p><h2>Baltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>A match-up between two above-average teams that share the same crucial flaw: neither of them is very good at protecting their quarterback. Baltimore's Joe Flacco drew a lot of criticism for his five interceptions against Buffalo last week, and much of it was merited; when you sign a $120.6m contract, the bar of expectation has to be raised. But he was also hit 12 times in that game, while a non-existent running game did nothing to slow down Buffalo's pass rush. The Ravens at least acknowledged their problem by trading for Jacksonville offensive tackle Eugene Monroe on Thursday. Miami's Ryan Tannehill could be excused for wondering when he might find a little better protection after being sacked a league-high 18 times so far. But I do not see an awful lot between these teams, and Miami are at home. </p><p><strong>Dolphins to win</strong></p><h2>New England Patriots @ Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>The Patriots answered some doubters (myself included) by winning what was supposed to be a tough road game in Atlanta, despite the continued absences of Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola. At time of writing, it is still not yet known if those two will make it back into the line-up on Sunday (of the two, Amendola looks more likely) but the Patriots have lost another important player in the meantime, with defensive tackle Vince Wilfork tearing his Achilles during the win over the Falcons. The impact of that injury should not be underestimated; even the New England head coach Bill Belichick acknowledged on Wednesday that \"there's no replacing Vince\". Cincinnati are 2-0 at home, but lost in Cleveland last week and have struggled to get their passing game going. If Aqib Talib can cover AJ Green as effectively as he did Julio Jones, the Bengals will have a hard time improving in that department.</p><p><strong>Patriots to win</strong></p><h2>Seattle Seahawks @ Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>This will be billed as Russell Wilson versus Andrew Luck – a face-off between two second-year quarterbacks who each excelled in their rookie year. And while that is undoubtedly an overly-simplistic way to look at things, it is true that each man's success in overcoming certain obstacles could set the tone for how this one pans out. For Wilson the challenge is to find some consistency after an up-and-down start to the season – one in which Seattle have won every game and yet somehow still looked out-of-sync at times, especially on the road. Luck, on the other hand, will need to show that he knows how to pick his spots against the Seahawks' formidable cornerback pairing of Richard Sherman and Brandon Browner. The latter task looks more daunting to me.</p><p><strong>Seahawks to win</strong></p><h2>New Orleans Saints @ Chicago Bears (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>It has not taken Sean Payton long to turn the Saints back into a contender; since returning from his year-long suspension, the New Orleans head coach is a perfect 4-0. Chicago had been unbeaten themselves through the first three weeks, but came badly unstuck in Detroit. A return home gives them their best chance of turning things around – and they have won all of their last three meetings with the Saints in Chicago – but  a defense that is giving up 28.5 points per game will have its hands very full with Drew Brees and co. </p><p><strong>Saints to win</strong></p><h2>Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm BST)</h2><p>Antrel Rolle believes the Giants could win their next 12 games. Right now most Giants fans would settle for just one. An 0-4 start looks bad enough before you even stop to consider the fact that they have lost the last two games by a combined score of 69-7. But the Eagles have not exactly been setting the world alight either, extinguishing talk of Chip Kelly's offense as the NFL's Next Big Thing with three defeats in as many games. After the initial shock of Philadelphia's first-half explosion in Washington, there is a sense that experienced NFL coaches are working out ways to slow the Eagles down. And Tom Coughlin certainly has experience on his side. </p><p><strong>Giants to win</strong></p><h2>Carolina Panthers @ Arizona Cardinals (Sunday 4.05pm ET/9.05pm BST)</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/23951057/bruce-arians-calls-cardinals-offense-putrid\">When a head coach defines his own team's offense as \"putrid\", as Arizona's Bruce Arians did this week</a>, then that is probably not a good sign. Much as it was last season, the Cardinals' blocking up front has been a disaster, and it is hard to see how they will get much better in the short term after they traded offensive tackle Levi Brown to Pittsburgh for a conditional draft pick. The Panthers arrive refreshed from a bye week and high on confidence after routing the Giants 38-0 in their previous game. And yet they are still just a 1-2 team right now, and cross-country road trips are not to be taken lightly. </p><p><strong>Cardinals to win</strong></p><h2>And the rest</h2><p>Here are the rest of this week's games. These are not included in the Pick Six, but feel free to post your picks for these as well. If you do so then please keep them separate from your Pick Six predictions, as it will make life a lot easier when tallying up your scores.</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong><br />1pm ET/6pm GMT<br />Detroit Lions @ Green Bay Packers<br />Kansas City Chiefs @ Tennessee Titans<br />Jacksonville Jaguars @ St Louis Rams<br />4.25pm ET/9.25pm BST<br />Denver Broncos @ Dallas Cowboys<br />8.30pm ET/Monday 1.30am BST<br />Houston Texans @ San Francisco 49ers<br />11.35pm ET/Monday 4.35am BST<br />San Diego Chargers @ Oakland Raiders</p><p><strong>Monday</strong><br />8.30pm ET/Tuesday 1.30am BST<br />New York Jets @ Atlanta Falcons</p><p>Bye weeks: Minnesota Vikings, Pittsburgh Steelers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Washington</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419020645|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|98deb8e2bf26ff9240e6d808cdc7b6e2e1d645f3 -->",

        "headline":"Drew Brees and Peyton Manning keep breaking NFL records",
        "body":"<h2>Manning, and the Broncos, look better than ever</h2><p>Peyton Manning is running out of records to break. In four weeks, the Denver Broncos quarterback has thrown 16 touchdowns, the most ever by a single player inside the first month of a season. Manning is also yet to throw an interception. The last signal caller to reach 16 touchdowns without a pick was Milt Plum in 1960 – and he needed 10 games to reach that mark. </p><p>Of course, we are used to Manning breaking records by now. He was the fastest player ever to reach 50,000 passing yards, and then the quickest to reach 60,000, too; he has the most Pro Bowl selections for a quarterback (12) and has been named as the NFL's Most Valuable Player more times (four) than anyone else in league history. </p><p>And yet, at 37 years old, he continues to raise the bar even higher. Manning's passer rating so far this season stands at 138.0 – <a href=\"http://mmqb.si.com/2013/09/30/peyton-manning-monday-morning-quarterback/\">the best it has been over a four-game stretch at any point of his career</a>. Surrounded by an outrageously talented set of targets in Denver – from wide receivers Wes Welker, Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker through to the tight end Julius Thomas – he is dismantling defenses at will. </p><p>His numbers against Philadelphia on Sunday were typically outlandish. Manning completed 28 of 34 passes for 327 yards and four touchdowns as the Broncos won 52-20 – setting a new team record for most points scored in a single game. </p><p>Perhaps the most preposterous statistic of all was the one that showed Denver had not even faced a third down on any of the quarterback's final four drives – which totaled 305 yards and each ended in a touchdown. Manning was pulled out of the game thereafter with the victory effectively secured.  </p><p>It is easy to forget now that many people doubted Manning when he joined the Broncos last year. There was trepidation over a player who had missed the entire 2011 season recovering from neck surgery.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jan/18/rob-lowe-peyton-manning-indianapolis-colts\"> Analysts asked whether his arms strength could ever be the same</a>. That question has been answered in emphatic terms. </p><p>And Manning is not the only one exceeding expectations. The Broncos' defense was supposed to struggle without its leading pass rushers Elvis Dumervil, <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/03/15/fax-snafu-leads-to-elvis-dumervils-release/\">who left in free agency after a fax machine fiasco</a>, and Von Miller, serving a six-game suspension to start the year. The 12-time Pro Bowl cornerback Champ Bailey has also missed every game so far due to a foot injury, and yet the Broncos have forced 11 sacks and six interceptions. </p><p>\"Manning and the Broncos defy logic,\" wrote Adam Schein on NFL.com. \"They laugh in the face of logic. They're a flawless 4-0 while punching logic in the mouth.\"</p><p>They are also playing with a mighty chip on their shoulder after last season's playoff defeat to Baltimore, made possible only by an inexplicable blown coverage on a Hail Mary pass by Joe Flacco in the dying seconds of regulation. This is a team hell-bent on returning to the postseason in order to right those wrongs. </p><p>One writer for the Denver Post went as far as to suggest that <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/hochman/ci_24203311/hochman-broncos-treating-nfl-like-its-preseason\">the next 12 games will be little more than an extended preseason for the Broncos</a>, leading up to January, the playoffs and \"the only games that matter\". Even with Denver playing in a strong division, where the Kansas City Chiefs are also 4-0, that assessment does not feel wide of the mark. </p><h2>The Saints can still air it out, too</h2><p>Going into their game against the Dolphins on Monday night, the hype around New Orleans revolved mostly around their recently-discovered ability to stop other teams from scoring. The Saints had achieved new levels of defensive ineptitude in 2012, giving up the most yards (7,042) of any team in NFL history. They allowed their opponents an average of 28.2 points per game. </p><p>That had all changed under new defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan. Hired in February to replace Steve Spagnuolo, the former Dallas Cowboys coach achieved immediate results with his hybrid 3-4 scheme, using a variety of different looks and blitzes to keep opponents off guard. Through week three New Orleans gave up just 38 points and 295.7 yards per game. Those numbers looked all the more impressive when you considered that they had lost several starters to long-term injuries.<br /> <br />Better yet for Saints fans, <a href=\"http://www.nola.com/saints/index.ssf/2013/09/bar_patrons_benefit_from_new_o.html\">Ryan turned out to be the sort of guy who walks into bars and buys everybody a round</a>. But while his defense flourished, the offense had not yet attained its usual dominance. The Saints were hardly struggling on that side of the ball, but their 23.3 points per game placed them pretty firmly in the middle of the pack. They had averaged 28.8 a year previously. </p><p>But if the league needed reminding of what Drew Brees and co were capable of, then they saw it on Monday night. Miami arrived in New Orleans unbeaten, and opened the game playing with a confidence reflective of that status. At the first-half's two minute warning, they trailed just 14-10. By the end, however, they had been defeated 38-17.</p><p>The difference was Brees, looking untouchable at times as he completed 30 of 39 passes for 413 yards and four touchdowns. Along the way he equaled an NFL record by making this his ninth consecutive game with 300+ passing yards. And who exactly had set the previous record? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/384871346372485120\">That would also be Brees, between 2011 and 2012</a>. </p><p>And so New Orleans, like Denver, move to 4-0. After showing some new strings to their bow over the first three weeks, they have reminded the league that the old ones still work just as well as they ever did. </p><h2>The NFC East has become the NFC Least</h2><p>There was a time when the NFC East was considered to be the toughest division in football. Its representatives won five out of six Super Bowls between 1990 and 1995, and although such heights had not quite been recaptured since, it remained highly competitive. Only once between 2002 and 2009 did the NFC East fail to send at least one team to the wildcard round of the playoffs. In both 2006 and 2007, it sent two. </p><p>Not for nothing, in other words, was it nicknamed the NFC Beast. These days it is resolutely the NFC Least. Only one of the division's four representatives won this weekend – Washington recovering from 14 points down to overcome an Oakland team that was missing its starting quarterback. The remaining three NFC East teams – the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles – lost by a combined score of 113-47. </p><p>Even that was an improvement on week two, when all four teams were defeated. Such collective failure nevertheless felt symbolic of a greater decline. Not once between 2002 and 2010 had they all lost on the same weekend. </p><p>One quarter of the way through their respective seasons, the NFC East's representatives have a combined record of 4-12. And two of those wins were essentially unavoidable, since they were obtained in divisional play. </p><p>So it is that the Cowboys occupy top spot at 2-2, despite giving up 506 yards and blowing a 21-13 lead en route to defeat in San Diego. It is hard to imagine them maintaining their .500 record when the Broncos come to town next weekend. </p><p>Behind them, Washington and Philadelphia, with one win each, have the two worst-ranked defenses in the league. The Giants, 0-4, have given up a scarcely credible 16 turnovers in four games, yet can still survey the standings and reason that all is not lost. </p><p>Because the fact is that, come January, one of these four teams will be hosting a postseason game. Three years ago, the Seattle Seahawks became the first team (outside of strike-shortened seasons) to reach the playoffs with a losing record, topping the NFC West with just seven wins. Right now it is hard to feel confident about any of the East's representatives even getting that many. </p><h2>Fantasy Football Thoughts</h2><p>Fantasy owners who drafted Brees and Manning should be feeling pretty pleased once again this morning after performances that will place them as the top two points scoresr in many Fantasy formats. But who else stood out this week? And who should you be looking to add from the waiver wire?</p><p><strong>Star performers</strong></p><p>1) Adrian Peterson lit up London with a dazzling performance in the International Series game, rushing for 140 yards and two touchdowns in the Vikings 34-27 win over Pittsburgh. And he even made time to praise the Wembley crowd afterwards, too. \"The atmosphere was electric,\" he said. \"Coming out of that tunnel, looking at all that purple and yellow … and [with] all that energy, it felt like a home game.\"</p><p>2) Tony Gonzalez had been relatively quiet through the first three weeks, but dominated the new England Patriots on Sunday, claiming 12 receptions for 149 yards and two touchdowns. Sadly the same cannot be said for his team-mates, as the Falcons lost 30-23 to fall to a surprising 1-3. </p><p>3) Reggie Bush returned from a knee injury for Detroit and picked up right where he left off, rushing for 139 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries, as well as making four catches for 34 yards. But if those numbers look good to the player's Fantasy owners, then the footage of his <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000252133/WK-4-Can-t-Miss-Play-Bush-blows-by-Bears\">juking, skipping, leaping 37-yard touchdown run was even more of a joy to behold</a>. </p><p><strong>Worth picking up </strong></p><p>1) Rashad Jennings could be in line to take over as Oakland's starting tailback after both Darren McFadden and Marcel Reece left the Raiders' defeat to Washington with injuries. Subbing in for those two on Sunday, he produced a modest 45 yards rushing on 15 carries, but was more productive in the passing game – taking eight receptions for 71 yards. </p><h2>Quick hits</h2><p>• There is a certain irony to the fact that the most compelling game in the seven-year history of the International Series should be played between two teams who arrived in London with a combined 0-6 record. The Vikings and the Steelers remain two flawed teams, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/29/nfl-clockwatch-steelers-vs-vikings-london-special-live-wembley\">they gave Wembley everything it was hoping for: a close, competitive match-up that was decided only in the final few seconds</a>. Anecdotally, I know of at least one former sceptic who claimed to have been won over to the sport by this game. I might still advise him to steer clear on 27 October, though, when the Jacksonville Jaguars come to town. </p><p>• The best celebration of the week belonged to the Broncos running back Knowshon Moreno, who<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/5tUe0VA.gif\"> brushed up on his rock, paper, scissors skills after scoring against Philadelphia</a>. Last week his team-mate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/24/broncos-rock-paper-scissors-ronnie-hillman-touchdown\">Ronnie Hillman had earned a shot at a touchdown in against Oakland after beating Moreno and their team-mate Montee Ball at the classic playground game</a>. </p><p>• Have Peyton Manning's ubiquitous Papa John's endorsements finally spilled over into the games themselves? It is unclear from <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000253462/Broncos-players-yelling-Papa-Johns?continuous=true\">this video</a> exactly who is responding to the quarterback's audible by bellowing the pizza delivery company's name, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000253462/Broncos-players-yelling-Papa-Johns?continuous=true\">but it is certainly there for all to hear</a>. </p><p>• Wes Welker has certainly enjoyed catching passes from Manning this year – the pair hooking up for two touchdowns on Sunday, and six so far this season. But the receiver's former partner in crime, Tom Brady, seems to be surviving OK without him. Despite the continued – and increasingly contentious – absence of tight end Rob Gronkowski, the Patriots extended their perfect start with an impressive 30-23 win over the Falcons in Atlanta. And for all that the focus will inevitably land on Brady and the offense, the real star of the show for New England might have been cornerback Aqib Talib, who shut down Julio Jones for a large part of Sunday evening, as well as breaking up a potential game-tying pass from Matt Ryan to Roddy White in the end zone with seconds remaining. </p><p>• Joining the Broncos, Chiefs, Patriots and Saints at 4-0 are Seattle, who trailed 20-3 at half-time in Houston but rallied to win 23-20 in overtime. It was cornerback Richard Sherman who tied things up in regulation, <a href=\"(http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000252291/Sherman-58-yard-pick-six\">returning an interception 58 yards for the score, and losing his shoe along the way</a>. Given that there were less than three minutes left in the game at the time, many Houston fans wanted to know what had possessed quarterback Matt Schaub - who had already given up two pick sixes this year - to throw such a pass in the first place. Others skipped the questions and <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/texans-fans-engage-in-very-sad-matt-schaub-jersey-burni-1427294414?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">went straight to burning his jersey in the parking lot</a>.</p><p>• Could we soon see the NFL expand its playoffs to a 14-team field? ESPN reported on Sunday that the idea is under \"urgent\" consideration by the league, and <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9743015/nfl-considering-expanded-postseason-format-3-game-preseason-sources-say\">could implement it as soon as 2014</a>. </p><p>• One moment, Josh Freeman is starting quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the next he is watching games from a suite after seemingly being banished from the sideline altogether by head coach Greg Schiano. The speed with which this relationship has fallen apart is startling. The Bucs would like to trade Freeman, but the situation is sufficiently ugly already that some are asking whether they <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/09/29/bucs-need-to-trade-or-cut-freeman/\">might be better off just cutting him</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418699746|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2a7d3db3646335768a70a745f575a2f7af9784ff -->",

        "body":"<p>One of the most spirit-lifting moments <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/29/minnesota-vikings-pittsburgh-steelers-nfl\" title=\"\">during the NFL's latest visit to London</a> – to these eyes, at least – came when two black head coaches, Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Leslie Frazier of the Minnesota Vikings, shook hands: the first time, surely, that two black managers have done so at Wembley. For Americans, however, the gesture was as unremarkable as the Lite beer. Since the introduction of the Rooney Rule in 2003, which compels NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate for head coach and general manager jobs, these handshakes are frequent enough that few notice. That is how is should be.</p><p>The before-and-after makeover is striking. Before the Rooney Rule there were six black NFL head coaches in more than 80 years. In the decade since 12 have been hired. They are succeeding, too: at least one minority head coach or general manager has made the Super Bowl every year since 2006. Frazier, for one, believes it has changed his life. \"The opportunities I've had to interview with other teams is the reason I am a head coach now,\" he said. \"Prior to the Rooney Rule it was difficult to get before owners. The Rule opened things up.\"</p><p>Listening to Frazier, and reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/27/sol-campbell-racism-manager-arsenal\" title=\"\">Sol Campbell lament his lot</a> in Saturday's Guardian, you wondered whether English football will ever follow the NFL's lead. The PFA has lobbied for the Rooney Rule, and has drawn up a 30-strong \"Ready List\" of black coaches keen on coaching and managerial positions but there is no great swell behind it. Most Britons seem instinctively more comfortable with no action than affirmative action; trusting instead in a vague sense that things will right themselves.</p><p>But will they? There are only four black and ethnic minority managers among the 92 English league clubs (the figure has bobbed between two and four for most of the past decade), even though around 25% of professional players and 18% on PFA coaching courses are black or from other ethnic minorities.</p><p>Ah, say the sceptics: look at the 2011 census. Only 5.6% of people in the UK are black or mixed white/black, so there is nothing to worry about. Then come other familiar refrains: if a manager is good enough they will get their chance, because no club would undermine their chances of success by not appointing the best candidate; that the Rooney Rule is reverse racism, because it gives minority managers favourable treatment; that, condescendingly, adopting it would be \"tokenism\".</p><p>These objections are – almost word for word – the same objections heard in the US before the Rooney Rule was enforced; objections that have since been <a href=\"http://www.nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-82-number-3/tackling-unconscious-bias-hiring-practices-plight-rooney-rule%C2%A3sthash.a2uQAF6D.dpuf\" title=\"\">shot down by the New York University Law Review</a>. It found that: \"Despite ongoing allegations that it promotes tokenism and is a form of reverse discrimination, the Rule has reached uncharted success.\"</p><p>Their key point was that while the NFL's \"decision makers unwittingly held (and often still hold) archaic biases regarding the intellectual ability of minority candidates … the Rule has proven effective because it forces decision makers harbouring this unconscious bias to come face-to-face with a candidate they would never have considered otherwise.\"</p><p>Is English football any less unconsciously biased? A <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/936722/Why_arent_there_more_black_football_managers\" title=\"\">study in the Journal of Ethnic and Racial Studies</a>, which interviewed 1,000 fans and former players, suggests not. It found \"56% of respondents believe racism operates at the executive levels of football, ie the boardroom\", with most suspecting \"a form of unwitting or institutional racism\".</p><p>You can understand why minority coaches get frustrated. If the road ahead is likely to be blocked, why start the journey? It is not as if manager's jobs are scarce in English football. In every season since 1998-99 at least a third have been sacked: often the figure is closer to half. Yet despite this great churn the same faces keep getting on and off (and on) the carousel.</p><p>What we don't know, however, is the percentage of minority coaches who apply for manager's jobs and get an interview – or a job – compared with other ethnic groups. The Rooney Rule came about in the NFL following a report showing white coaches with minimal experience were often hired over better qualified black coaches. The fear of litigation concentrated minds.</p><p>Some point out that of the 192 Uefa Pro Licence owners in England only 14 are held by minority coaches but that is not an essential requirement for a manager's job in the lower leagues. A Uefa A or B licence would suffice. Introducing the Rooney Rule in League One, League Two and the Conference, say, could be a game-changer. It would not force teams to appoint a minority candidate: merely to interview one when a vacancy arose. It is a nudge, not a shove. But look at the dramatic effect it had in the NFL.</p><p>Not that the Rooney Rule is perfect. When a team have a definite candidate in mind, the process can become an elaborate charade – although that happens in other businesses too. Some also fear that its impact in the NFL has stalled given that no minorities were among the eight head coaches appointed in 2013. No one, however, disputes that the NFL has more pathways for minority coaches to succeed than it did a decade ago. Can we say the same about English football?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418564683|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9fb3ff164a214ab4bac9c3d1d2e77d9a0315ec6e -->",

        "body":"<p>The 2013 NFL season is almost upon us: Following on from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/02/nfl-2013-preview-afc?CMP=twt_gu\">our preview of the NFL's American Football Conference</a> it's the turn of the National Football Conference. At the bottom of this article, you will also find our pick for Super Bowl XLVIII.</p><p><em>Teams listed in order of projected finish</em></p><h2>NFC East</h2><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Washington Redskins</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 10-6</p><p>This might be the toughest division to call in the whole league. Three of the four teams involved look capable of posting a winning record, yet none of them seems likely to be dominant. I could imagine the Cowboys, Giants and Redskins all going 9-7 more easily than any one of them going 12-4.</p><p>I'm taking Washington to win the division, but that pick comes with a pretty big asterisk. If Robert Griffin III were to reinjure his surgically-repaired left knee, then they could conceivably plummet to last place. Kirk Cousins is a perfectly serviceable NFL back-up, and performed well in relief last year, but he is not an equivalent player to RGIII.</p><p>The Redskins will hope for another strong year from running back Alfred Morris, whose 1,600 yards rushing as a rookie are too often forgotten amid the Griffin hype. Washington's defense will benefit from the return of Brian Orakpo, but concerns remain about a flaky secondary – despite the team's efforts to address that area in the draft. </p><p><strong>2) New York Giants</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 9-7</p><p>Expectations are modest for the Giants this year; under Tom Coughlin that is generally when they are at their most dangerous. The team's biggest move this offseason was signing Victor Cruz to a new five-year contract, thereby avoiding any training camp holdout by the receiver. If he and Hakeem Nicks stay healthy, Eli Manning should be able to do plenty of damage in the passing game. </p><p>Much like Washington, New York's biggest problems are on the other side of the ball. This team badly needs Jason Pierre-Paul to play at his best, upgrading the pass rush and helping to mask the team's problems in coverage. But the defensive end is coming off back surgery this summer, and might not be ready for week one.</p><p><strong>3) Dallas Cowboys</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 8-8</p><p>The Cowboys have enough talent on their roster to be a play-off team. Tony Romo is a good quarterback – even if perhaps not as good as <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000155364/article/tony-romo-signs-108m-contract-with-dallas-cowboys\">his new $108m contract might suggest</a>. He has excellent receivers to throw to in Dez Bryant and Miles Austin, and his team should be better on the other side of the ball, too, after replacing defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan with Monte Kiffin.</p><p>And yet, how are we supposed to get behind a team whose owner spent the offseason <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/21599224\">pressuring his head coach into giving up play-calling duties</a>? These Cowboys are too dysfunctional to play up to their ability.

Photograph: Adam Hunger/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Green Bay Packers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong>  11-5</p><p>Life is going to keep getting tougher in the NFC North. Green Bay finished just one win ahead of Minnesota and Chicago last season, and both teams appear to have strengthened during the offseason. Detroit, meanwhile, are a better team than last year's 4-12 record would suggest.</p><p>The Packers, though, have Aaron Rodgers, and that fact alone will carry them a long way. Statistically the best starting quarterback in the league last year, he has steered his team to at least 10 wins in each of the past four seasons. There is no good reason to believe that he will fail to do so this time around.  His favourite target, Greg Jennings, might have departed, but Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and James Jones represent a solid set of fall-back options.</p><p>Green Bay's offense should in fact be more balanced, too, with second-round draft pick Eddie Lacy expected to provide immediate improvement at running back. The question, as so often, will be whether their defense is good enough to stop opponents from hanging on in a shoot-out. Having Clay Matthews available for all 16 games certainly wouldn't hurt.</p><p><strong>2) Chicago Bears</strong></p><p><strong>Last season: </strong> 10-6</p><p>This might be Jay Cutler's last shot in Chicago. The quarterback has been up and down for the Bears, and often in the most literal sense possible, since he has been sacked nearly three times per game over the past three seasons. This year the team has taken significant steps to address that issue, with four new starters across the offensive line, and new head coach Marc Trestman will be watching closely to see how the quarterback fares behind this new group.</p><p>The defense has lost its emotional leader in Brian Urlacher, but the linebacker had lost a step and no longer dominated a game as he once had. The man who was supposed to replace him, DJ Williams, has missed most of preseason with a calf injury, but this unit is still expected to be one of the best in the league. </p><p><strong>3) Minnesota Vikings</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 10-6</p><p>Adrian Peterson defied all reasonable logic last season, returning just nine months after a cruciate ligament tear and rushing for 2,097 yards. Only one player – Eric Dickerson – has ever rushed for more than 1,800 yards in consecutive seasons, and as special a player as AP is, you would have to expect some regression. </p><p>Have the Vikings strengthened sufficiently elsewhere to make up the difference? Right now it is not clear. Free agent wide receiver Greg Jennings and first-round draft pick Cordarrelle Patterson should together represent an upgrade over the departed Percy Harvin at the position, but it remains to be seen whether Christian Ponder can get the ball to them. On defense, the decision to release cornerback Antoine Winfield might come back to bite this team.</p><p><strong>4) Detroit Lions</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 4-12</p><p>Like AP, Calvin Johnson is likely to see his numbers fall somewhat after a record-breaking 2012. For the Lions, it will be good news if they do. That would mean that they have succeeded in diversifying an offense that was far too one-dimensional last year, with Stafford throwing a staggering 205 passes in the direction of his No1 receiver.</p><p>The acquisition of Reggie Bush – fresh from two strong years in Miami – should help towards that end. With Ziggy Ansah added to an already menacing defensive line, the Lions will win more games than they did last year, but might still finish up at the foot of a division where no team looks likely to be a pushover.</p><h2>NFC South</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454578'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/14/1358122001617/d80e0054-99f0-4c24-a60d-769109d95b80-460.jpeg' alt='Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt Bryant vs Seattle Seahawks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Atlanta Falcons beat the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC divisional playoff game earlier this year.  Photograph: David Goldman/AP</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 13-3</p><p>It is no secret that the Falcons believe they are ready for a Super Bowl run. They thought so last year, too, but the team's actions since the end of last season have been geared towards short-term success. First they persuaded tight end Tony Gonzalez to come back for one more year. Then they went out in free agency and signed running back Steven Jackson away from St Louis. He turned 30 in July, and it is a well-established fact that players at his position tend to deteriorate once they enter their fourth decade. Jackson, furthermore, is a physical back who has taken more hits than most. Nevertheless, he was extremely effective for the Rams in the latter part of last season – a result of head coach Jeff Fisher's smart decision to limit his touches earlier in the year. If the Falcons can manage Jackson's time on the field with similar effectiveness, he could be a difference-maker come playoff time.</p><p>And barring any injury to quarterback Matt Ryan, this team should certainly get back to the postseason. The receiving tandem of Julio Jones and Roddy White remains one of the best in the league, and on defense Osi Umenyiora could help upgrade the pass rush. A lot is being expected of rookie cornerbacks Desmond Trufant and Robert Alford, but defensive co-ordinator Mike Nolan has a good track record of keeping his units competitive. </p><p><strong>2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>What next for the Muscle Hamster? Tampa Bay's diminutive running back, also known as Doug Martin, had a sensational rookie season, rushing for 1,454 yards and 11 touchdowns, as well as catching 49 passes for a further 472 yards. If he can repeat those numbers, this team could be bound for the postseason. </p><p>Josh Freeman's 4,065 passing yards and 27 touchdowns last season represented new franchise records at his position, but he will hope to improve his accuracy now that he has a full year working with head coach Greg Schiano under his belt. A hideous passing defense, meanwhile, has been upgraded hugely by the addition of cornerback Darrelle Revis. </p><p><strong>3) New Orleans Saints</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>How much difference does a head coach make? The Saints had to do without Sean Payton last season as he served a one-year suspension as punishment for his alleged involvement in the team's bounty scandal. They duly missed out on the playoffs for the first time in four years, losing more games in one season than they had over the previous two combined.</p><p>Payton is now back, and his play-calling should galvanise the Saints' offense. That said, this team moved the ball OK even when he was absent. More important in determining New Orleans's fate might be the impact of new defensive co-ordinator Rob Ryan, who takes over a unit that gave up a league-worst 440.1 yards per game last year and has had only modest additions.</p><p><strong>4) Carolina Panthers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-9</p><p>I have the Panthers at last place in this division, yet they could easily finish as high as second. There is certainly plenty of confidence in Carolina after the team finished 2012 with five wins from its last six games. Seven of the Panthers' nine losses were by less than one touchdown.</p><p>Cam Newton is a talented quarterback who takes a few too many chances but can succeed if the other pieces are in place. Carolina might also have the best pass rush in the division, with first-round pick Star Lotulelei slotting in at defensive tackle alongside Dwan Edwards and the already prolific pairing of Charles Johnson and Greg Hardy at defensive end. There is some concern, however, that age might start to catch up to the running back rotation of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. </p><h2>NFC West</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416454579'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/3/1357235144261/a3e59bb8-2040-4611-b885-abba633de970-460.jpeg' alt='Russell Wilson, Seattle Seahawks' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>How will Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson fare in his second season?  Photograph: George Holland/ZUMA Press/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p><em></em></p><p><strong>1) Seattle Seahawks</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 11-5</p><p>The Seahawks' big offseason play to upgrade their offense, trading away a first-round pick to acquire Percy Harvin from Minnesota, backfired when the receiver injured his hip over the summer. He is expected to miss most of the season, and yet his team can still win this division.</p><p>A running game led by the indomitable Marshawn Lynch has been lent depth with the selection of Christine Michael in the second-round of this year's draft, and will continue to be the foundation of this team's offensive success. For all the excitement around quarterback Russell Wilson last year, the Seahawks still ran the ball a lot more often than they threw it. </p><p>Their greatest strength will continue to be the defense. Already exceptional at linebacker and in the secondary, the Seahawks have strengthened their supposed weak link, the defensive line, significantly with the capture of Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett in free agency. If Wilson continues to progress as expected, they will be Super Bowl contenders.</p><p><strong>2) San Francisco 49ers</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 11-4-1</p><p>Nothing less than a Super Bowl will satisfy 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh, who steered his team to that stage last year after reaching the AFC Championship game in 2011-12. He has the pieces in place for another run, from a beastly front seven on defense through to an exceptional offensive line that can pave the way for another great year of Colin Kaepernick, Frank Gore and the read-option offense. </p><p>So why rank them below Seattle? My concerns relate to the state of the team's secondary, which lost safety Dashon Goldson in free agency, as well as the situation at wide receiver, where Michael Crabtree is out injured. But San Francisco are still going to be a very good team; my hunch is just that Seattle will be better.</p><p><strong>3) St Louis Rams</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 7-8-1</p><p>Nobody won more divisional games in the NFC West last year than St Louis, who went 4-1-1 against San Francisco, Seattle and Arizona. Unfortunately, they also went 3-7 against everybody else. They have lost their starting running back, Steven Jackson, and top wide receiver, Danny Amendola, since then, but still have reasons to believe that they will perform better.</p><p>Chief among those is the simple fact that quarterback Sam Bradford will be working under the same offensive co-ordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, for a second consecutive season – making this the first time in his career that he will get to work in the same system for two years running. If the former No1 overall pick can translate that consistency into the sort of improvement that people around the franchise expect, then this team – blessed with an underrated defense that features one of the best lines in the league – could grab a playoff berth.</p><p><strong>4) Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p><strong>Last season:</strong> 5-11</p><p>The Cardinals are another team that did not get enough credit for the quality of its defense last year, mostly because every time they forced a turnover their offense would give the ball straight back. A new coaching staff in Arizona will seek to preserve the good while eliminating some of the bad. </p><p>Carson Palmer represents an upgrade at quarterback (he could hardly do worse than Josh Skelton, Ryan Lindley et al) and has the right attributes to air the ball out in Bruce Arians' deep passing offense, as well as one of the best wide receivers in Larry Fitzgerald. But Palmer cannot throw passes lying down, and there is concern that the team's glaring weaknesses along the offensive line remain, especially after the team's first-round draft pick, guard Jonathan Cooper, broke his leg in preseason. </p><h2>Playoff permutations</h2><p><strong>Division winners:</strong> Washington Redskins, Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Falcons, Seattle Seahawks.</p><p><strong>NFC Wildcards:</strong> San Francisco 49ers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p><strong>NFC Championship game:</strong> Seattle Seahawks over Atlanta Falcons</p><p><strong>Super Bowl XLVIII:</strong> Seattle Seahawks over Denver Broncos</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/02/nfl-2013-preview-afc\">AFC preview</a></h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416363213|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|099461631dddf3839ff9148d955dfaf625470ba8 -->",

        "headline":"RG3 says 'now is the window' for gay NFL players to come out",
        "body":"<p>The Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III has said that \"now is the window\" for any gay NFL players to come out. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/08/rg3-gq-cover-story-interview-outtakes.html\">Speaking to GQ magazine</a>, Griffin III – who is known to fans as RG3 – said: \"Yeah, man. I think there are [gay players] right now, and if they're looking for a window to just come out, I mean, now is the window. My view on it is, yes, I am a Christian, but to each his own. You do what you want to do. If some Christians want to look at being gay as a sin, then thinking about other women, committing adultery – or any of those other sins that are in the Bible – those are sins, too. And God looks at all of us the same way.\"</p><p>The quote was included in an \"outtakes\" post on GQ's website, rather than in the cover story itself.</p><p>The issue of whether gay professional sportsmen or women can or should come out has been keenly discussed since April, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/29/jason-collins-gay-sports-illustrated-wizards\">Jason Collins, an NBA center who has most recently played for the Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards</a>, became the first openly gay athlete still playing in the four major US professional sports leagues – the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL.</p><p>In early April, almost a month before Collins' announcement, the former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, an advocate of LGBT rights, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/05/four-nfl-players-coming-out-ayanbadejo\">said four NFL players were close to coming out</a>. \"I think it will happen sooner than you think,\" Ayanbadejo said, in an interview with the Baltimore Sun. \"We're in talks with a handful of players who are considering it. There are up to four players being talked to right now and they're trying to be organized so they can come out on the same day together. It would make a major splash and take the pressure off one guy. It would be a monumental day if a handful or a few guys come out.\" </p><p>No current NFL players have yet come out, although Ayanbadejo and the Oakland Raiders punter Chris Kluwe have continued to press the issue. In September 2012, Kluwe made headlines when he issued <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5941348/they-wont-magically-turn-you-into-a-lustful-cockmonster-chris-kluwe-explains-gay-marriage-to-the-politician-who-is-offended-by-an-nfl-player-supporting-it?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">a stinging public rebuke to Emmett C Burns Jr</a>, a Maryland state politician who had objected to Ayanbadejo's support for gay marriage. Kluwe's open letter to Burns Jr – which used colourful language, including an assurance to the politician that gay people getting married would not \"magically turn you into a lustful cockmonster\" – went viral.</p><p>In the NFL season that followed, controversy was stirred up by remarks made by players in response to questions about the likelihood of players coming out. In January, in the build-up to Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans, the San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver said: \"I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that. No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do. Can't be with that sweet stuff. Nah … can't be … in the locker room man. Nah.\" </p><p>After the 49ers organisation disowned his remarks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/31/chris-culliver-gay-apology-49ers-superbowl\">Culliver issued a statement of apology</a>: \"The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel. It has taken me seeing them in print to realize that they are hurtful and ugly. Those discriminating feelings are truly not in my heart. Further, I apologize to those who I have hurt and offended, and I pledge to learn and grow from this experience.\"</p><p>In March, <a href=\"http://www.towleroad.com/2013/03/seattle-seahawk-christopher-clemons-says-gay-player-coming-out-would-be-selfish-act-that-would-divid.html#ixzz2Pbc7fQ5d\">Christopher Clemons, a Seattle Seahawks defensive end</a>, called coming out \"a selfish act\" that would \"separate a lockerrom and divide a team\".</p><p>The approach of the 2014 Winter Olympics, which will be held in the Russian resort of Sochi, has also focused attention on gay rights in American sports. Given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/09/russia-gay-world-athletics-sochi\">Russia's recent passing of discriminatory laws</a>, calls have grown for the Games to be boycotted on human rights grounds. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/obama-press-conference-nsa-reforms-live\">President Obama last week rejected the idea, saying</a>: \"One of the things I'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we're seeing there.\"</p><p>The NHL, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/12/nhl-you-can-play-gay-homophobia\">which recently partnered with the LGBT rights organisation You Can Play</a>, will allow its players to compete at the Games.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-414959044'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/5/26/1369569685758/Robbie-Rogers-unveiled-as-011.jpg' alt='Robbie Rogers unveiled as new LA Galaxy signing - video' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Robbie Rogers now plays for the LA Galaxy, having come out – and retired – while playing in the UK.

Officials ruled the death a homicide but did not say how Lloyd died. Lloyd's relatives said he was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, that the two men were friends and that both men were out together on the last night of Lloyd's life.</p><p>Hernandez was taken into custody on Wednesday, before 9am, and put into the back of a police cruiser. He was wearing a white v-neck t-shirt, and his arms were inside the shirt and behind his back as he was led from his North Attleborough home. He casually spit into some bushes on his way to the car. </p><p>Hernandez was arrested on a state police warrant and was booked at the North Attleborough police station, state police said on the agency's Twitter account. State police said they would not discuss the charge against Hernandez until it was presented in Attleboro District Court. Hernandez was taken from the North Attleborough police station to his court hearing on Wednesday afternoon. About two dozen supporters cheered, some yelling \"We love you Aaron,\" as the car carrying him left the police station.</p><p>The Associated Press emailed a message to Hernandez's attorney, Michael Fee, who hasn't discussed the investigation beyond acknowledging media reports about it. A message also was left with the Bristol County district attorney's office.</p><p>Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, declined to comment at her Boston home Wednesday morning. \"Nothing to say, please. Thank you,\" she said, before shutting the door.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/23/aaron-hernandez-nfl-player-search\">State police have searched in and around Hernandez's sprawling home in North Attleborough several times</a>. At least three search warrants have been issued in connection with the investigation. Reporters have been camped for days outside the home on the Rhode Island line, not far from the stadium where the Patriots play. They reported on Tuesday that Hernandez had been visited by a Boston defense attorney, James Sultan.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-411675953'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/21/1371825121875/New-England-Patriots-tigh-010.jpg' alt='New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Aaron Hernandez in action.

        "headline":"How the NFL Draft became the biggest non-sporting sports event",
        "body":"<p>It could be argued that the NFL Draft has become the world's most popular sporting event that doesn't contain any actual live sports. The league's annual selection meeting has been around since 1936, but it has increased in popularity in recent years at a rate that outpaces any other major event in the sporting world.</p><p>Just ask former Dallas Cowboys vice president of player personnel Gil Brandt, who has been scouting draft prospects for five and a half decades.</p><p>\"It has exceed expectations by about a million times,\" Brandt told me over the phone from Texas last week.  He remembers the media coverage the draft received in the 1950s and 1960s and can't fathom how much things have changed.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"If we had five or six national writers [covering the draft], that was unheard of. Guys had no idea they were drafted. 'Drafted? Into the Army?' Now, though, the interest in the draft is just totally unbelievable.\"</p></blockquote><p>Until 1980, the draft wasn't televised. Until 1995, it was held in hotel ballrooms in Chicago, Philadelphia or New York. It moved from Tuesday/Wednesday to Sunday/Monday in 1988, because, according to NFL.com, \"the Marriott Marquis [in New York] offered the NFL a better rate on those days for the ballroom space.\"</p><p>Now, 12,000-plus watch live at Radio City Music Hall, with more than 8 million tuning in to watch the first round alone on ESPN and NFL Network, to see which college players are chosen by which pro teams. To put that audience into perspective, two NBA playoff games played on the same night last year garnered a combined 1.8 million viewers. </p><p>The Draft routinely crushes the NBA now, as well as the Stanley Cup Finals and postseason baseball. In fact, the lowest-rated game of last year's World Series between the Giants and the Tigers edged out the opening round of the draft by only 2.4 million viewers.</p><p>The combined total viewership of the draft grew by nearly 100 percent from 2001 to 2010, according to ESPN's public-relations department. The Super Bowl, for the sake of comparison has only seen its viewership increase by 28 percent since '01 (84 million viewers for Super Bowl XXXV compared to 109 million for this year's game between the Ravens and the 49ers).</p><p>The increased interest has spawned a growing field of \"draft experts,\" who seem to appear alongside Punxsutawney Phil each February before disappearing again by the first of May. And it goes beyond the Mel Kipers and Todd McShays of the football world. A cottage industry has emerged, too, built mainly on mock drafts, draft rumors and in-depth scouting reports at websites that are becoming less obscure by the year.</p><p>Walter Cherepinsky, who runs <a href=\"http://walterfootball.com/\">WalterFootball.com</a>, says his site gets the vast majority of its readers because of its draft analysis. Cherepinsky writes a popular weekly picks column throughout the year and offers up plenty of fantasy football advice, but none of it holds a candle to the draft. WalterFootball.com received 36 million page views in April of 2012, which was double the viewership it garnered during December, the final month of the actual season.</p><p>\"The draft stuff just dwarfs everything,\" Cherepinsky told me last week. \"It combines the college football fans and the NFL fans. The college football fans are interested in knowing where their favorite players are gonna go and the NFL fans want to know which players are gonna make their team better.\"</p><p>Cherepinsky notes that the numbers grew each month from September on last year, not because of the approaching playoffs and the Super Bowl, but because there's more draft interest as the season progresses.</p><p>\"The fans know that they're out of playoff contention,\" he told me, \"so they look forward to the draft to see how their teams can get better.\"</p><p>Why has draft interest increased so much in the last 10-20 years specifically? There are several reasons, but the first—sadly—is that we've been taken advantage of by the league's mad men.</p><p>\"It's a product of armies of PR people who want to keep fans engaged throughout the offseason,\" said Michael Broder, a Philadelphia-based media psychologist and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Stage-Climbing-Shortest-Highest-Potential/dp/1889577391\">Stage Climbing: The Shortest Path to Your Highest Potential</a>. \"The media has really hyped it, and it's all about money.\"</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"What they've managed to do is make the season never-ending.\"</p></blockquote><p><br />Wait, are we that robotic? Are we victims of a PR machine? Did ESPN and the NFL decide that they needed to push for extra attention in the offseason, causing us to follow like sheep? If ESPN jumped off a bridge, would we join them?</p><p>\"It's incredibly depressing,\" said Arthur Raney, a professor of communication at Florida State University and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Handbook-Sports-Media-Arthur-Raney/dp/0805851887/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366590657&amp;sr=1-3\">The Handbook of Sports and Media</a>. </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It is truly an extension of the NFL brand. There are marketing interests that are in play here that go well beyond the NFL. It's not only the NFL creating its next group of marketing faces, but it's also products in any number of industries that these faces are going to be attached to as well.\"</p></blockquote><p>Both Broder and Raney agreed when asked about a possible connection between the draft and reality television. The draft moved to prime time in 2010, but even before that, the nature of the early-round broadcasts gave it an American Idol feel.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-407653848'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/10/1305040248403/American-Idol-007.jpg' alt='American Idol' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Would you want these people to choose the next NFL star? Photograph: 20thC.Fox/Everett/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p><em></em><br />\"It feels that way,\" said Raney. \"Spread out over three days, it's almost like a reality miniseries.\"</p><p>Forget three days. The draft process as a whole is spread out over three months. A ridiculous 7.25 million people tuned into NFL Network to watch the annual scouting combine this past February. During the entire 2012-13 NBA regular season, only two games drew more viewers than that.</p><p>And then there are thousands of hours of analysis crammed between the combine and the draft, including John Gruden's increasingly popular QB Camp, which features the former coach working with some of the draft's top prospects.</p><p>\"I never really thought that it would get this big,\" Gruden told me on a conference call. \"The draft has become a huge spectacle.\"</p><p>\"I think the commissioner and the NFL have done an excellent job keeping the game strong and interesting to fans,\" Gruden added. \"This is a big vehicle for teams to get better, obviously, the draft.  With the popularity of the game, people want to know who the players are that can help their team turn the corner.  I think that's what's made it so exciting and fun.  I've enjoyed being a part of it.\"</p><p>Teams certainly do turn that corner often. About five new teams make the playoffs each year, so one player could change everything. And parity is a big reason why draft interest has exploded in recent years.</p><p>\"I think it's about hope,\" said Cherepinsky. \"Football's the one sport in America where you can turn around in just one year. It's happened so many times. And teams build primarily through the draft.\"</p><p>Indeed they do. Free agency has lost its luster, with Super Bowl champions usually building through the draft.  Recent winners such as the Ravens, Giants, Packers and Steelers typically stayed away from free agents, and fans are catching on.</p><p>Of course, it's not as though that's a completely new trend. Even before free agency, teams that focused solely on the draft were more successful. Brandt notes that in Super Bowl X in 1976, 85 of the 86 active players were drafted in-house.</p><p>\"People copy success,\" said Brandt, who is now a senior analyst at NFL.com. \"I think that the teams realize and recognize how important the draft is and consequently are spending a lot more time on it, and I think that the people that are working for these teams are a lot better as far as what you're looking for and what it takes to be an NFL player than people did 25 years ago.\"</p><p>Maybe this is, to some degree, the result of something kick-started by Tex Schramm and those draft-savvy Cowboys teams from the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe it just took time for personnel and scouting departments league-wide to catch up, and for fans to then follow suit, with ESPN playing the catalyst role. The reality is that the fans' interests are going to align with the interests of their favorite teams, but that didn't happen overnight.</p><p>\"Scouting used to be a one-story motel out in the country,\" <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nfl/news/20130331/carson-palmer-kevin-kolb-monday-morning-quarterback/\">Brandt told Sports Illustrated's Peter King earlier this year</a>. \"Now it's the Sears Tower. And growing.\"</p><p>It can't be a coincidence that teams and fans became increasingly obsessed with the draft in consecutive eras.</p><p>So we're not only brainwashed by what Raney calls \"the weight of the league's PR and marketing departments,\" but we're also influenced by what our teams are focusing on.</p><p>There is one thing, though, that everyone involved is invested in, at least to a degree—and that's hope. Any draft pick could be the next Tom Brady or RG3. For teams, that's reason enough to spend millions on scouts. For PR departments, that's reason enough to spend millions on hyping the draft. And for fans, that's reason enough to spend hours reading mock drafts and prospect profiles in the lead-up to the three-day event.  </p><p>\"There's all those mock drafts out there, and they're always wrong,\" said Raney, \"but it's the uncertainty of it.\"</p><p>I spoke to one Cowboys fan last week who said he wasn't even that into the draft, but he still completely understood the intrigue when it comes to that one-in-whatever chance that his team could land the next superstar.</p><p>\"It's exciting,\" Kris Barrie told me, \"and it endows every fan with a sense of hope that our next superstar is just a walk to the stage away from taking us to the next level.\"</p><p>You can't help but think of the lottery. Statistically, your team's chances of drafting a future Super Bowl MVP are much greater than your chances of winning the Powerball jackpot, but there's a one-in-some high number chance that either will happen. We're drawn to the drama, the mystery, the gamble, and that chance.</p><p>Thirty-one of the NFL's 32 teams fail to reach their ultimate goal every year, and those spoiled brats from the 32nd team will always tell you that winning has made them even more hungry.  And so everyone is desperate, and nobody can avoid thinking about what the draft might do for them.</p><p>Thus, it's no coincidence that the draft has become the second-biggest event on the NFL calendar, behind only the Super Bowl.</p><p>Said Broder:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"There's definitely a direct correlation between whatever happens in the draft and their team getting to the Super Bowl. You wonder where it's going to go next.\"</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport\">Guardian US sports</a> will have further NFL Draft coverage this week, including a liveblog of the main event on Thursday, 8pm ET</h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407634578|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|40f2713a0abbc9fa3db41f815c3a07eeac7539ef -->",

        "headline":"Pat Summerall, star NFL broadcaster, dies aged 82",
        "body":"<p>Pat Summerall, the deep-voiced NFL player-turned-broadcaster who spent half of his four decades calling sports famously paired with John Madden, died Tuesday. He was 82.</p><p>Susie Wiles, Summerall's daughter, said her father died in Dallas.</p><p>\"He was an extraordinary man and a wonderful father,\" Wiles said. \"I know he will be greatly missed.\"</p><p>Summerall was part of network television broadcasts for 16 Super Bowls. His last championship game was for Fox on February 3, 2002, also his last game with long-time TV partner Madden. The popular duo worked together for 21 years, moving to Fox in 1994 after years as the lead team for CBS.</p><p>At the end of their final broadcast together, Madden described Summerall as \"a treasure\" and the \"spirit of the National Football League\" in a tribute to the partner that complemented the former coach so well.</p><p>\"You are what the NFL is all about, what pro football is all about, and more important, what a man is all about and what a gentleman is all about,\" Madden said.</p><p>As former teammate and broadcaster Frank Gifford put it in an accompanying video tribute: \"America is very comfortable with Pat Summerall.\"</p><p>Summerall played 10 NFL seasons with the Chicago Cardinals and the New York Giants between 1952 and 1961. He started doing NFL games for CBS in 1964, and became a play-by-play guy 10 years later. He was also part of CBS's coverage of the PGA Tour, and the US Open tennis tournament.</p><p>When CBS lost its NFL deal after the 1993 season, Summerall switched to Fox to keep calling NFL games with Madden. He had hoped to keep working with CBS for other events like the Masters, but network executives saw it otherwise. At the time, CBS Sports anchor Jim Nantz said he was \"very saddened\" that Summerall didn't get to leave CBS under his own terms.</p><p>A recovering alcoholic, Summerall had a liver transplant in April 2004.</p><p>After an intervention involving, among others, former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, Summerall checked into the Betty Ford Clinic in April 1992.</p><p>Summerall received the liver of a 13-year-old junior high football player from Arkansas who died unexpectedly from an aneurysm. Summerall had an emotional meeting with the teenager's family the following year.</p><p>Born George Allen Summerall on May 10, 1930 in Lake City, Florida, he was an All-State prep football and basketball player there, and lettered in baseball and tennis. He played college football at Arkansas before going to the NFL.</p><p>After breaking his arm in the preseason as a rookie for Detroit, Summerall played five years for the Chicago Cardinals before four seasons with the Giants. While he was also a defensive back, Summerall was primarily a kicker, making 100 field goals and 256 of 265 extra points in his career.</p><p>Summerall was part of the NBC and CBS simulcast of the inaugural Super Bowl in Los Angeles on January 15 1967. After working the first half in the broadcast booth, he switched places with Gifford at half-time and was a sideline reporter during the second half.</p><p>\"To look at the Coliseum that day and see that there were like 40,000 empty seats and the most expensive ticket was $12, it's incredible to realize what was going on and what it's grown to over the years,\" he said during a 2009 AP interview. \"It's sort of staggering to me.\"</p><p>After his final game with Madden, Summerall remained a full-time broadcaster for Fox one more season, doing primarily Dallas Cowboys games during the 2002 season. He decided to step down the following year when he realized he would spend most of the season away from home.</p><p>Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/407325284|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|5d80aa190494c4fc4d304ceaa3dc23f476af8b24 -->",

By the way, if anyone is bored, please go to Ray Lewis' Wikipedia page. 6 kids 4 wives. Acquitted for murder. Paid a family off. Yay. What a hall of fame player!

I let the competitiveness of the game and the comments people were making about a team I dearly love get the best of me.

Brady did, to his credit, <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/22/ed-reed-brady-apologized-for-slide/\">apologise to Reed for the incident</a>. </p><p>• Doing the rounds this week: <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/usatoday.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=bd4f28430a8b41d58becad00afae3a50\"><strong>footage of Ray Lewis's first NFL sack</strong></a>. Why so much attention? Because it just so happened to be on a certain Jim Harbaugh – now head coach of the Ravens' Super Bowl opponents, the San Francisco 49ers. </p><p>• <strong>Impressive words from 49ers quarterback Alex Smith on the subject of going into a Super Bowl as back-up to Colin Kaepernick</strong>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bittersweet.

Payton said he had \"no interest\" in speaking to his still-suspended former defensive co-ordinator Gregg Williams, and also rejected claims – published during the season – that he had<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/cowboys/post/_/id/4705114/sean-payton-there-was-no-way-i-was-going-to-another-team\"> considered leaving the Saints to join the Dallas Cowboys</a> upon his return. </p><p>• Another hot topic this week: <strong>did the then Oakland Raiders head coach Bill Callahan deliberately sabotage his team at Super Bowl XXXVII?</strong> That was the allegation that the former Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown seemed to make on Tuesday, when <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/01/21/tim-brown-suggests-sabotage-by-bill-callahan-in-super-bowl-xxxvi/\">he told SiriusXM NFL Radio the coach had completely changed his team's game-plan just 36 hours before kick-off</a> – switching away from a run-heavy offense towards a much greater focus on the pass. Oakland subsequently lost the game to Tampa Bay, 48-21.</p><p>There did not seem to be too much ambiguity about Brown's words Tuesday. \"We all called it sabotage . . . because Callahan and [Tampa Bay coach Jon] Gruden were good friends,\" Brown said. \"And Callahan had a big problem with the Raiders, you know, hated the Raiders.  You know, only came because Gruden made him come.  Literally walked off the field on us a couple of times during the season when he first got there, the first couple years.\" </p><p>But a day later, on the Dan Patrick show, Brown was keen to backtrack. \"I've never said [Callahan] sabotaged the game,\" Brown said. \"That's something that can never be proven. We can never go into the mind of Bill Callahan... I should have said we could have called it sabotage. It was a question, not a statement. You cannot prove it.\"</p><p>Confusing the matter further, Brown's former team-mate <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000129743/article/jerry-rice-agrees-bill-callahan-threw-super-bowl\">Jerry Rice suggested on Tuesday that he agreed with the initial allegation</a>.  </p><p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8871919/bill-callahan-former-oakland-raiders-coach-says-sabotage-allegations-ludicrous\">Callahan firmly rejected the claim</a>, saying: \"While I fully understand a competitive professional football player's disappointment when a game's outcome doesn't go his team's way, I am shocked, saddened and outraged by Tim Brown's allegations and Jerry Rice's support of those allegations made through various media outlets over the last 24 hours,\" Callahan said. \"To leave no doubt, I categorically and unequivocally deny the sum and substance of their allegations.\"</p><p>• <strong>The family of the late San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau has opened a wrongful death lawsuit against the NFL</strong> - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/23/junior-seau-family-sues-nfl-cte?INTCMP=SRCH\">claiming that his suicide was the result of brain disease caused by the violent collisions he sustained while playing football</a>. </p><p>• We've got this far without acknowledging it, but yes – <strong>there is in fact a game of football happening this weekend. The Pro Bowl</strong>'s drift into complete irrelevance has been discussed at length elsewhere <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jan/27/nfl-pro-bowl-superbowl\">(including by this blog at around this time last year</a>) but at least one man does still seem to care. <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000129920/article/peyton-manning-roasts-players-at-closed-pro-bowl-meeting\">Peyton Manning reportedly gave an impassioned speech imploring players from both rosters to try their hardest</a>. We'll see if it makes any difference on Sunday. If any of us actually remember to tune in, that is. </p><h2>Super Bowl XLVII on the Guardian</h2><p>Our coverage of the big game begins in earnest next week, with a series of blogs and features in the build-up to the main event – from me and the rest of the Guardian US Sports team. You can keep up with all the latest on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/nfl\">our special NFL page</a> and via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GdnUSsports\">@GdnUSsports</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/guardianussports\">Facebook</a>.</p><p>I will be in New Orleans from Tuesday, so <strong>if you have any questions for individual players post them below the line here</strong> and I will do my best to make them on your behalf at one of the various media availabilities. Please be aware that your chances of getting an answer are much better with an Anquan Boldin or Carlos Rogers than they might be with a Colin Kaepernick or Ray Lewis.</p><p>On Super Bowl Sunday we will have live coverage running through the day of the game until the final gun – plus reports, blogs and comment to follow. Here's hoping you'll join us for all of it.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/402949422|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|418b0767d7941c41239bb30167d47c767fe347a6 -->",

        "headline":"Super Bowl lineup: Ray Lewis, Colin Kaepernick and the Harbowl",
        "body":"<h2>Jim Harbaugh was right to go with Colin Kaepernick</h2><p>Back in November, Jim Harbaugh told us that he planned to ride the \"hot hand\" at quarterback. Two months later, Colin Kaepernick's blistering right paw has slung the 49ers into the Super Bowl. In doing so he has vindicated his coach's greatest gamble.</p><p>In truth, the debates over Harbaugh's decision to promote Kaepernick above Alex Smith died down a little while ago. There may never be a quarterback less deserving of losing his job than Smith – who had done everything the coaching staff asked and was enjoying the best season of his career up until his week 10 concussion against St Louis. But when your replacement is playing as well as Kaepernick did in obliterating the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round, nobody is going to sit around mourning your absence.</p><p>Before this Sunday, though, it was still too soon to declare Harbaugh's switch a total triumph. Because as he deliberated and dwelled over his options at quarterback in November, the foremost question in the coach's mind will not have regarded which player was more talented or could put up the gaudiest numbers. The only thing that truly concerned Harbaugh was which player gave his team the better chance of playing in this year's Super Bowl.</p><p>Of course, Kaepernick possessed greater upside – three years younger and with more impressive physical tools – and on another team there might have been an argument for long-term thinking. But after last year's NFC title game defeat to the Giants, Harbaugh knew he had the rest of the pieces in place to make a run at a championship. In the NFL, those windows close quickly.</p><p>As unthinkable as it seems today, there was a strong case to be made for sticking with Smith. He had taken his team to the brink of an NFC title just one year previously – and although he came up short against New York last January, he seemed to have learned a few lessons since then. He was a safe pair of hands who could get the job done for a San Francisco team that was good enough not to need a superstar under center.</p><p>Except that on Sunday, they did need that superstar. The Falcons had burst out of the gates to a 17-0 lead, Matt Ryan and Julio Jones looking so perfectly in sync that you wondered how they would ever be contained. It takes strong nerves to come back from that sort of deficit in an environment as hostile as the Georgia Dome. It also takes a quarterback capable of winning games, not just managing them. Recovering from a 17-point deficit to win represented the third-largest comeback in NFL postseason history.</p><p>That is not to suggest Kaepernick carried his team alone, or carved up Atlanta single-handed. San Francisco battled back into the game with a combination of an effective ground game, smart defensive adjustments and improved blocking of both the run and pass. </p><p>But they also leaned on a quarterback who showed himself adept at exploiting the defense's weaknesses, whether that was through regular targeting of Vernon Davis – a player he had barely thrown to over the previous seven games – or knowing when to hand the ball off to Frank Gore in the read-option offense. His numbers – 16 of 23 for 233 yards and a score, plus two carries for 21 yards – are solid enough, but they do not speak to the poise, the decision-making and the calm he brought to his offense. </p><p>Perhaps the 49ers would have made the Super Bowl with Alex Smith at quarterback, too, and perhaps he was deserving of the chance to lead them there. But nobody will be dwelling on such hypotheticals in San Francisco this morning, because Colin Kaepernick did get them there. And that, when assessing Harbaugh's biggest call, is all that really matters.</p><h2>The other Harbaugh might know what he's doing too</h2><p>Brace yourselves for the HarBowl – as San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh takes on his older brother, the Baltimore Ravens coach John, at Super Bowl XLVII. Last season they became the first siblings ever to coach against one another in the NFL – during a Thanksgiving Day game in Baltimore, which the Ravens won 16-6. Now they will be the first to do so with the title on the line. </p><p>This match-up was so nearly a reality last year, when both brothers lost their respective conference title games by just three points. Asked last week if they had ever discussed the prospect of meeting in the Super Bowl, John replied: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Not that I'd ever admit to.\" </p></blockquote><p>The possibility must at least have been on the minds of two men who talk by phone every week. With each sending game film to their father Jack Harbaugh – formerly a successful college coach – on a regular basis, you have to wonder whether either has woken up this morning regretful over one too many trade secrets leaked at a family dinner somewhere down the line.</p><p>Jim has always carried the higher profile – the result, at least in part, of his more successful playing career. Exactly 15 months younger than his brother, Jim enjoyed 15 years as an NFL quarterback – split between six different teams. After retiring in 2001, he needed just three years to land his first head coaching job with the University of San Diego. </p><p>John, a former defensive back, never played beyond college and instead spent two decades climbing the coaching ladder before finally getting his first head coaching gig in Baltimore in 2008. At the time it was considered a surprise appointment, but a 62-30 record (including playoffs) since then has <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/nfl/news/20130118/nfl-game-plan-john-harbaugh/index.html\">more than vindicated the Ravens' decision</a>. Only one head coach has won more games over the same period – Bill Belichick, whose Patriots John defeated on Sunday. </p><p>And if Jim's gamble on Kaepernick was rewarded this weekend, then John can claim similar success with his boldest move. The Ravens head coach's decision to fire offensive co-ordinator Cam Cameron in mid-December raised more than a few eyebrows – read by many as a panic move from a team who had dropped back-to-back games and were threatening to lose their grip on the AFC North.</p><p>Instead, Jim Caldwell's elevation from quarterbacks coach to Cameron's replacement has worked out beautifully. Baltimore would lose the next game to Denver, 34-17, but since then they have averaged 28 points and 431 yards per game. Caldwell has encouraged quarterback Joe Flacco to both spend more time outside of the pocket and take regular shots downfield. The results have been breathtaking.</p><p>In three playoff games, Flacco has thrown for 853 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions. Amid blustery, frost-bitten conditions at Gillette Stadium in the AFC title game, Flacco thoroughly outperformed New England's Tom Brady – just as he had Peyton Manning in Denver two weeks previously.</p><p>That is a testament to the quarterback himself, as well as a remodeled offensive line which has done a great job in protection. But it is also to the credit of his coaching staff. </p><p>\"Hey Jim, congratulations – you did it, you're a great coach,\"<a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=68f2afec0d654a4ea1fa6928e42061a2\"> said John in a fleeting piece to camera for CBS</a> just before Baltimore's game in New England. Big brother is not looking too shabby himself. </p><h2>Bernard Pollard still haunts the Patriots</h2><p>The narrative around Baltimore's defense will focus once again on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ypzddbi_9KE\">Ray Lewis, who sobbed during the national anthem</a> and then went on to lead his team in tackles against New England. And so one of the greatest linebackers ever to play the game – <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/01/10/ray-lewis-baltimore-ravens-atlanta-murder-2000/1566198/\">and also perhaps the most controversial one</a> – will get to end his career at the Super Bowl, no doubt prefaced by one last pre-game shimmy as he makes his way out of the tunnel.</p><p>His team-mate Terrell Suggs stole some headlines, too, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=t_YsZbXYOx4\">commanding reporters to \"tell 'em [the Patriots] to have fun at the Pro Bowl\"</a> as he made his way back to the locker room after the game. \"These are the most arrogant pricks in the world starting with Belichick on down,\" he is reported to have added. \"That's funny, ever since SpyGate they haven't been able to win.\" He later tempered those comments, saying: \"All BS aside they are a hell of a ball club ... They have the right to be arrogant.\"</p><p><em></em></p><p>The single most critical defensive play of the game for Baltimore was not by Lewis or Suggs, though, but instead the safety Bernard Pollard. It is a name which recalls grim memories for New England fans. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/ravens/2013/01/21/bernard-pollard-baltimore-ravens/1850637/\">A man jokingly referred to as \"Patriot killer\" by his team-mates</a> has been involved in four significant New England injuries since 2008.</p><p>Tom Brady, in that year, was the first – blowing out his knee on  a tackle from Pollard, then a Kansas City Chief. One season later the same player, now with the Houston Texans, was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RK4qhQWIUo\">closing in on Wes Welker when the receiver tore his ACL while attempting to cut away</a>. Then, in last year's AFC title game, Pollard's tackle on Rob Gronkowski left the tight end with a high ankle sprain which would severely limit him in the Patriots' subsequent Super Bowl defeat.</p><p>The fourth incident arrived on Sunday, when <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=1b1b4da5f9744d63af4db7d3b0145830\">Pollard knocked Stevan Ridley briefly unconscious on a helmet-to-helmet collision</a> in the fourth quarter. The running back fumbled and Baltimore, leading 21-13 at the time, recovered at the New England 47. Their ensuing possession ended with a touchdown which extended the Ravens' lead to 15 points with just 10 minutes remaining – an advantage they would never relinquish.</p><p>There was nothing illegal about Pollard's hit – Ridley was running the ball and had himself lowered his head into the contact – but it is equally not the sort of play that the league wants to see celebrated at a time when the long-term damage caused by head injuries is at the top of the player safety agenda. </p><p>Afterwards, Pollard said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It's just a tackle. It's football. He broke a hole and we filled. That's fine. That's football. I hope he's okay. We're competitive in the moment. But when everything calms down you want that guy to be okay.\"</p></blockquote><p>Last week Pollard had struck a similar note, telling NFL.com he did not derive any joy from his reputation of doing damage to the Patriots' players: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"Anything that I've done, I don't celebrate with that. I don't laugh when people come up to me and call me 'The Brady Killer'. I don't laugh at that. I'm looking at a man that I respect. I respect Tom Brady with everything that I have. I know his story, I respect him, first of all, because he's a man. I respect him because he's a player. Honestly, I don't get excited because of that. When it's all said and done, that man had to do the treatment, he had to do everything else to come back. Nothing is done maliciously.\"</p></blockquote><p>Ridley, encouragingly, walked off the field under his own power yesterday, though the long-term damage of a single hit like that may never be ascertained. What we do know is that once again a Bernard Pollard hit dealt New England devastating short-term damage.</p><h2>We have likely seen the last of Tony Gonzalez</h2><p>One of the most heart-breaking images of Sunday night was that of the Falcons tight end Tony Gonzalez – perhaps the greatest ever to play his position – slumped forwards on a small chair in front of his locker at the Georgia Dome. Once again Gonzalez had more than done his part, catching eight passes for 78 yards and a fine touchdown – for which he had timed his cut perfectly to move away from his defender before making a falling grab in the front of the end zone.</p><p>Gonzalez did not give firm confirmation of his retirement, but he did make it pretty clear that he is still leaning in that direction: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"It's probably the last time I'm going to wear that uniform. I didn't want to take it off, to tell you the truth. All good things come to an end and, like I said all season long, this is probably my last one. What an unbelievable ride.\"</p></blockquote><p>He insisted that he would have \"no regrets - not one\" if he did choose this moment to walk away, adding: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>\"I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\"</p></blockquote><p>The rest of us are instead left feeling sorry for ourselves at the thought of never again getting to watch a player who re-defined his position – blazing a trail for pass-catching tight ends. His 1,242 career receptions are second only to Jerry Rice. He leads the next-best tight end, Shannon Sharpe, by more than 400 catches. In this, his 16th season in the league, he reeled in 107 balls for 1,059 yards and 10 touchdowns (including the postseason).</p><p>Nobody doubts that Gonzalez could come back and play to a high level again next year, and the Falcons undoubtedly wish he would. But after finally recording the first playoff win of his career last week, the only thing that could bring Gonzalez back would be the desire to win a Super Bowl. Atlanta are well positioned to be a contender again, but even for a good team, it is a long, arduous road to get to that point. </p><p>It is his prerogative to decide that he has had enough, that the time has come to move on – to give his body a break and walk away. Even if the rest of us quietly wish that he wouldn't. </p><h2>Quick Hits</h2><p>• Picture of the weekend: <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5977451/colin-kaepernicks-parents-posed-in-front-of-a-statue-depicting-the-atlanta-falcons-giving-their-son-a-wedgie\">Colin Kaepernick's parents pose in front of a statue of him being given an enormous wedgie by an Atlanta Falcon</a>. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/billboard-england-says-ray-lewis-retirement-party-coming-200250322--nfl.html;_ylt=AptQJqJloa231U78x_lPG.pYYsp_;_ylu=X3oDMTE5Y2NtNW8yBG1pdANCbG9ncyBJbmRleARwb3MDNDIEc2VjA01lZGlhQmxvZ0luZGV4;_ylg=X3oDMTFpMm9iMzh1BGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDBHBzdGNhdANibG9nBHB0A3NlY3Rpb25z;_ylv=3\">Ray Lewis 1, Authors of this New England billboard 0</a>. </p><p>• The weekend's lowest note arrived in the hours after San Francisco's win at the Georgia Dome. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8863456/2013-nfl-playoffs-fan-stabbed-neck-georgia-dome-nfc-championship-game-san-francisco-49ers-atlanta-falcons-report\">An Atlanta Falcons fan was reported stabbed in the neck </a>after getting into an altercation with a 49ers fan near to the stadium, though he was later said to be in a stable condition. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=ca90d95204804bd89783b5c958b6df88\">Tom Brady performs the sort of sliding tackle that would get you sent off in the other kind of football</a>. </p><p>• <a href=\"http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/yahoo.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=7831fc26d00c4be7b136bdc2eec230c5\">Tantrum of the weekend belongs to Jim Harbaugh, whose toys finished up a long way from the pram</a> after officials upheld an admittedly highly questionable call stating that Harry Douglas had completed a catch on third down late in the fourth quarter. </p><p>• One enormous question for San Francisco to address over the next fortnight: how do you solve a problem like David Akers? The kicker had already missed more field goals this season than anybody else in the league, and on another day <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000128701/Akers-misses-Samuel-lets-him-hear-it\">his failure to convert from 38 yards midway through the third quarter</a> could have been the difference between winning and losing. Going into a Super Bowl with a kicker you cannot trust is not the sort of spot that anybody wants to be in – least of all a team who blew the NFC title game last year with the help of some critical special teams gaffes. </p><p>• All eight of the NFL's head coaching vacancies have now been filled, but <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000127869/article/no-africanamerican-nfl-head-coaches-hired-in-2013\">there is consternation around the league that none went to an African-American</a>. The Rooney Rule obliges all teams to interview at least one minority candidate, but of course all are free to hire as they see fit. The issue is an incredibly delicate one, with teams well within their rights to decide themselves which coach best suits their team's needs – but the league battling with a huge perception problem. Following the sackings of Romeo Crennel and Lovie Smith, there will be just three African-American head coaches in the NFL next year.</p><p><strong><em>Over the next two weeks we will have all the build up to the Super Bowl and extensive live coverage of the game itself.

        "body":"<p>Welcome to Conference Championship weekend on the NFL Talkboard. Just one game separates the four remaining teams from Super Bowl XLVII. Could it be a Harbaugh Bowl in New Orleans? Or will we see Tom Brady and Matt Ryan duking it out on the turf of the Louisiana Superdome?</p><p>Make your predictions below the line, but first of all do pause to toast <strong>saltlakecity </strong>and <strong>siday</strong>, the only two people to pick all four games correctly last week. Remarkably, <strong>saltlakecity </strong>is now 8/8 so far in the postseason. Are we about to witness the first ever perfect postseason in our Pick the Playoffs contest?</p><p><strong>We will be live blogging both games this weekend</strong>, so be sure to join us for those. And why not check back on Monday, too, for our usual <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jan/14/nfl-playoffs-colin-kaepernick-ray-lewis\">Five Things we Learned</a> column?</p><h2>San Francisco 49ers @ Atlanta Falcons<br />Sunday 3pm ET/8pm GMT</h2><p>Las Vegas's bookmakers opened their markets for this game last Sunday with San Francisco as a three-point favourite, but the betting on the 49ers has been so heavy that they had to move that out to 4.5. That makes Atlanta the biggest home underdog in a Conference Championship game since the league expanded to a 10-team playoff system in 1978.</p><p>That is a reflection on both the 49ers' perceived merits, and their opponents' flaws. Colin Kaepernick's dominant performance against Green Bay last week, for instance, might have given any defensive co-ordinator sleepless nights – but Atlanta's Mike Nolan has particular cause to be concerned. So far this season his unit have performed poorly against mobile quarterbacks – giving up 502 yards passing and 202 yards rushing to Cam Newton in two games against Carolina, as well as a combined 445 yards to Russell Wilson during last week's narrow win over Seattle.</p><p>Nolan, who had an unsuccessful stint as 49ers head coach between 2005 and 2008, should at least have his best pass rusher available – John Abraham is expected to play in some capacity after sitting out the second half of the Seattle game with an ankle injury. Although hardly the only factor, his absence certainly made life easier for a Seahawks offense that scored all of its 28 points while Abraham was off the field. </p><p>More than any one player, though, what the Falcons will need is disciplined, assignment-focused play to contain the 49ers' read-option offense. After all, it is not just Kaepernick who they need to look out for but also one of the league's best running backs in Frank Gore. </p><p>They will also need another productive day on the other side of the ball. The Falcons had a productive day on the ground last week – Michael Turner and Jacquizz Rodgers combining for 162 yards on an average of 6.75 per carry. But that was against a Seattle defense which, for all its strengths, defended poorly against the run throughout the second half of the season. By contrast, only two teams in the whole league have given up fewer yards per carry than San Francisco.</p><p>That puts a big onus on Matt Ryan and the passing game. Standing in their favour is the fact that this game is being played at home in the Georgia Dome, and that one of the 49ers' most important defensive players, Justin Smith, will once again be playing with an arm brace to protect his torn triceps. On the other hand, this 49ers' defense ranked fourth in the league against the pass during the regular season. </p><p>The match-ups do not favour Atlanta, and ultimately I find myself leaning towards the consensus view. But the Falcons are a good team – much better than they are being given credit for after last week's near collapse. I think this one will be closer than a lot of people imagine.</p><p><strong>49ers to win</strong></p><h2>Baltimore Ravens @ New England Patriots<br />Sunday 6.30pm ET/11.30pm GMT</h2><p>One year on from<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jan/22/baltimore-ravens-new-england-patriots-live\"> Lee Evans's drop and Billy Cundiff's miss</a>, Baltimore return to New England seeking redemption. Just as they did for last year's AFC title game, the Ravens will arrive at Gillette Stadium as heavy underdogs. But these are not the same two teams we witnessed last time around. </p><p>For starters, neither Evans nor Cundiff will be involved in proceedings – each having been released by Baltimore during the offseason. More significant has been the Ravens' change of identity over the last 12 months. A team which was for years defined by its aggressive and dominating defensive play this year ranked in the bottom half of the league for yards allowed.</p><p>That has been in part the result of injuries, with Ray Lewis, Terrell Suggs, Haloti Ngata and Bernard Pollard all featuring on the long list of players who have missed time this year. But even though their return has brought improved performance, it was nevertheless the offense that carried them through last week's divisional playoff game against Denver. </p><p>It is Joe Flacco's success with the deep ball which will give the Patriots most cause for concern. New England have been vulnerable to vertical passing attacks in the recent past and Torrey Smith – author of two touchdowns against Denver – has already enjoyed one big game against New England this season, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/sep/24/nfl-week-three-torrey-smith-cardinals\">catching six passes for 127 yards and two scores even while grieving the death of his younger brother</a> back in week three. </p><p>The Patriots, though, have revamped their secondary since then – adding Aqib Talib at cornerback and moving the struggling Devin McCourty back to safety, where his performances have improved. The rookie cornerback Alfonzo Dennard, who missed the start of the season due to injury, has also come into the line-up since that day and will start opposite Talib. That unit might still not represent an area of strength, but it is less of a weakness than it once was. </p><p>On offense the Patriots will have to do without Rob Gronkowski, though Tom Brady has shown already this season that he has more than enough weapons to cope without his tight end. As important as the passing game will be to both teams, New England will be keen to get more production on the ground than they did in week three, when Stevan Ridley and Danny Woodhead combined for just 71 yards on 28 attempts.  </p><p>New England will be heavily favoured because they are at home, and because throughout the regular season they were the better team. But with the Ravens' remodelled offensive line offering Flacco excellent protection over the last two weeks and that Baltimore riding an emotional high off that Denver win, something tells me this one might not follow the script. Put me down for the upset.</p><p><strong>Ravens to win</strong></p><h2>Please join us for liveblog coverage of both championship games on Sunday</h2><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/402574997|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0f37d046081f01126dc926f9e0a452954f314fea -->",
