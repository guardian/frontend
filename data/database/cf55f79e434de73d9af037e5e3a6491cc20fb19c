        "trailText":"<strong>Paul Rees:</strong> With the future of European rugby still far from certain, Wales's four regions are running out of time to secure their better out-of-contract players for next season",
        "headline":"Wales regions in limbo and pondering future without prime assets",
        "body":"<p>These may be taxing times for the Welsh regions, struggling to keep their heads above water despite liquidity problems, but there could be no excuses for the abject display of Cardiff Blues in the opening half at Exeter on Sunday, opponents with considerably less Heineken Cup experience who are in the middle tier of the Premiership.</p><p>The regions are concerned, with the future of European club rugby still to be settled, that they will lack the means to make realistic offers to players who are out of contract at the end of the season, including Leigh Halfpenny, Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Jonathan Davies.</p><p>They will need to tie them down before the end of the year, when they will be able to speak to potential new employers, but with the market value of those who were an integral part of the Lions' success in Australia in the summer increasing by at least 50%, they need an increase in revenue just to stand still: if there is no Heineken Cup, or a replacement, they will be some £1.5m worse off each.</p><p>The regions had hoped to resolve the contract issues before the start of next month's internationals: Warburton and Davies have publicly said that they want to stay with the Blues and the Scarlets respectively, but they are in limbo, not far from the point when they will have to look at other options.</p><p>The Blues fielded 13 internationals, five of whom were Lions, at Sandy Park but they looked a team of novices, 41–3 down before they found it in them to respond. They showed no spirit in adversity and neither, more surprisingly, did Ospreys at home to Leinster on Saturday night.</p><p>Alex Cuthbert, the Wales and Lions wing, scored two tries for the Blues and was their one player who rose above the mess, wearing such a look of disbelief in the first-half that if it as if he were asking himself why he last season signed a three-year contract extension with the region.</p><p>Similarly the Ospreys captain, Alun Wyn Jones, had to suppress his anger when discussing the defeat to Leinster a few minutes after the final whistle.  Jones has played for Ospreys all his senior career and the region regards him as the central figure in the squad, someone worth even as much off the field as he is on it, but whereas his heart will tell him to sign a new deal, once figures are attached  his head may tell him that, at the age of 28, it may be time to leave.</p><p>While the Blues had no excuses for their abject start against Exeter, Ospreys had a bench made up largely of emerging players against Leinster, a consequence of injuries and a budget that is lower than their French, English and Irish rivals. They had no one to turn a game that was ebbing from them and the fear of all four regions is that, if there is a European settlement, they will play no part in it and could end up poorer  in relative, if not real, terms.</p><p>The Welsh Rugby Union, which in recent years has been more of a rival than a support to its regions, has said it alone will be involved in whatever form negotiations take, with European Rugby Cup Ltd's survival prospects looking more remote by the day. The regions will remain on the outside.</p><p>The WRU's policy has been to find an ERC solution, that is to perpetuate the Heineken Cup, but the obduracy of the French and English clubs, who are adamant they will not after this season play in a tournament organised by ERC - and unlike previous disputes over Europe, in 1998 and 2006–07, they have not gone into the conference room naked, having armed themselves with what they describe as a lucrative television deal - has prompted it to consider an alternative.</p><p>Premiership Rugby has not specified exactly how much its BT television deal would add to the £44m shared by the six nations from the Heineken Cup. A figure of £70m has been quoted, but that would leave the four Welsh regions barely better off if the English and French clubs' demand for a three-way split between the leagues that feed into the European tournaments is accepted.</p><p>Currently, the four RaboDirect Pro 12 unions have 52% of the pot with the English and French clubs each banking 24%. If the pot increased to £70m and was divided three ways, the Rabo nations would have £23.33m, barely more than the £23m they had last season. It is understood that there is a proposal that 15% of the total should be apportioned on a merit basis: if that happened, the £70m would shrivel to less than £60m, meaning the basic sum for all three leagues would be less than £20m.</p><p>The Rabo unions share their money disproportionately, with Italy and Scotland receiving more per team than Ireland and Wales. The ideal for the four regions would be a division by 12, the number of teams in the Pro 12, which would give them a similar increase to the English and French clubs.</p><p>They will have no say in the carve-up, being reliant on the WRU, and the governing body has yet to say that it will be looking to secure the best possible deal for its professional sides. Its priority is to get the regions to sign a participation agreement with the union to replace the one that runs out at the end of the season, with the offer of an extra £1m to help retain players if they do.</p><p>The fear of the regions is that the WRU is waiting for the day when they collapse and the union will then set up its own sides, two or three in number and run them in the manner of Ireland's provinces.</p><p>It is a reason why the mood in the regions is so down, notwithstanding the Scarlets' ebullient display at Harlequins. They feel they will be worse off whatever the European outcome, losing not just their Lions but the next wave of Wales internationals. Their destiny will be decided by others and they need to find a way to get involved in the discussions.</p><p></p><p>• <a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/subscribe?emailListId=219\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby union.

It is not going to be a gentle ramble towards suburban Twickenham. Take the expectation on the shoulders of Roy Hodgson this week, stir it in with the demands of satisfying a host nation still in thrall to Jonny Wilkinson and co and you begin to get some idea of the unique pressures awaiting Stuart Lancaster and his players in two years' time.</p><p>That is partly why Lancaster has invited Hodgson to attend one of this autumn's QBE internationals, a series of games that should reveal whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/16/wales-england-six-nations\" title=\"\">last season's Six Nations collapse against Wales in Cardiff</a> was a blip or a longer-term problem. Either way, Hodgson and Lancaster sound like men on a broadly similar wavelength, particularly when it comes to big games. If there is an oval-ball version of Andros Townsend hiding out there, Lancaster will certainly be backing him.</p><p>That may not necessarily seem the obvious conclusion to draw from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/16/joel-tomkins-england-rugby-squad\" title=\"\">England's largely predictable squad announcement</a> at Lloyds of London on Wednesday, a place which knows all about striking a balance between risk and reward. As expected, three uncapped centres – Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell – and the Exeter back-rower Tom Johnson have been drafted in for the injured Manu Tuilagi, Brad Barritt and Tom Croft. Lancaster, though, made it clear he will be challenging everyone, regardless of age or experience, to aim high and abandon their comfort zones. \"I don't think you'll win big games without having a mindset to attack and players who can create things,\" he said, looking ahead to the  Australia, Argentina and New Zealand.</p><p>Rather than making sweeping personnel changes following the Millennium Stadium mauling, Lancaster is also seeking to harden minds. He wants players such as Billy Twelvetrees, set to be paired at centre against the Wallabies by either Tomkins or Trinder, to show they have matured into internationals and for more leaders to emerge in adversity than did so in Cardiff. Above all he wants calm-headed decision makers not scared to express themselves when it matters, as Hodgson's England ultimately did in their final two group games.</p><p>\"Credit to the footballers for dealing with the expectation and the pressure,\" Lancaster said. \"One of the challenges we're about to face is the expectation and pressure of being a home team at a World Cup. New Zealand faced it in 2011 and I thought they had the maturity and experience to deal with it and still deliver. Our challenge is to be ready for that. This series – three games at Twickenham against three big southern hemisphere sides – is great preparation.\"</p><p>It is certainly a prime opportunity for whoever of Tomkins or Trinder impresses most at training in Leeds next week. The powerful Burrell, for now, is behind them in the reckoning, with this weekend's Heineken Cup games between Saracens and Toulouse and Munster and Gloucester set to have a direct bearing as Lancaster continues to seek well-matched successors to Jeremy Guscott and Will Carling or Will Greenwood and Mike Tindall. \"Ideally, Brad and Manu would be involved but who says that Henry Trinder or Joel Tomkins can't force our hand? Rarely have we promoted someone and they've not dealt with it.\"</p><p>There is, in that respect, a barely concealed excitement about the promise of Billy Vunipola, set to start at No8 against Australia behind his front-row brother Mako because of an injury doubt over Alex Corbisiero. Fears the Lions and Northampton prop will miss the entire autumn series have been denied but the player will be out for at least a couple of weeks after having fluid drained from knee. \"He's not out of the series by any stretch of the imagination,\" Lancaster said. \"Everyone is hoping he will be available for some, if not all, of the games.\"</p><p>In the short term that suggests a double dose of Vunipola trouble for the Wallabies – \"As ball-carrying threats you could probably build quite a lot around them,\" murmured Lancaster – with Northampton's in-form Lee Dickson also pushing Ben Youngs and Danny Care for the scrum-half jersey. The captaincy announcement is due next Wednesday but Lancaster remains more concerned with the blend of his XV. \"At the moment there are very few clear-cut decisions in our team. Whether it is 7,6, 8, second-row, hooker, scrum-half, we have a lot of competition for places. The priority is to get that bit right. Then you assess your leadership group and you appoint your captain on top of that.\"</p><p>It is collective leadership under pressure, too, that has absorbed Lancaster in the wake of the defeat by Wales. \"At international level, if you're missing critical moments, they can hurt you. It's all part of your development. No team, even New Zealand, go in a straight line upwards all the time.\" To accelerate that maturation process, Lancaster has already undertaken a  fact-finding mission to Australia and New Zealand to see what else England can learn from their southern hemisphere counterparts, with three Tests and a potential midweek game against Super 15 opposition in New Zealand planned for next June, too. Between now and then, he also aims to pick Hodgson's brains.</p><p>\"Hopefully Roy and I will have a chance to chat,\" he said. \"I've spoken to him a couple of times in the past … we'll certainly invite him to our games and hopefully he can enjoy them without worrying about the result.\" If nothing else, Hodgson can tell him how it feels to be the focus of a nation's scrutiny.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420182408|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|fac44cc09c4cc59f98ed100d6e4bbd9e32fba83f -->",

Trinder, 24, has missed Gloucester's last two matches because of a hamstring problem, and may sit it out this weekend when his team travel to Munster, so Northampton's Luther Burrell was added as injury cover.</p><p>The trio join Billy Twelvetrees and Kyle Eastmond as the centres in the squad, five players with a total of seven caps and four Test starts between them, although Owen Farrell, one of three fly-halves in the 34, is an option at inside-centre, a position he regularly filled at Saracens last season.</p><p>Twelvetrees and Burrell are 12s, Trinder and Tomkins 13s with Eastmond comfortable in both positions. At the squad announcement, Lancaster kept repeating the word form: Tomkins and Burrell have been part of consistent teams this season, Saracens and Northampton respectively, but Twelvetrees and Trinder have had to make something out of the little supplied to them by the Gloucester eight.</p><p>Mike Tindall, the former England centre who is now player-coach at Gloucester, had called last month for England to consider Trinder as one of the solutions to their midfield injury crisis, calling him the \"form player of the year by quite a long way\" at Kingsholm. That his elevation came as a surprise was as a result of his absence owing to injury problems from the Saxons squad who were named in the summer. He has only made the rare leap straight into the elite set-up after the consent of Premiership Rugby, who could have blocked the double jump under the terms of its elite player agreement with the Rugby Football Union.</p><p>\"He had an outstanding Churchill Cup when I coached the Saxons a couple of years ago and he has started the season really well,\" Lancaster said. \"We have had a good look at him and he is chosen on merit. I know Luther well from his time at Leeds and he has come on since the summer tour to Argentina.  Joel has also stood out and it is tough on Jonathan Joseph, as I told him. The others have made a difference and centre is such a competitive position that players have to show the X-factor.\"</p><p>The stand-out centres have been <sup></sup>Burrell and Tomkins but would Lancaster risk an uncapped midfield pairing on 2 November against Australia who, for all their deficiencies in the tight five, remain one of the more inventive teams behind? It appears to be a matter of who starts alongside Twelvetrees, who made a notable impact on his Test debut against Scotland last February.</p><p>\"Trinder and Tomkins have impressed us this season,\" said the England backs coach, Andy Farrell. \"Harry has shown maturity to go with his quick feet and hands and a strong kicking game. He has been sensational. Joel has now reached the point where rugby union is instinctive to him and all credit to Saracens for playing him regularly last season: we are seeing the fruits of that.\"</p><p>Nigel Davies, the head coach at Gloucester who enjoyed a long career as a centre for Llanelli and Wales, has described Trinder as the complete package in his position. \"He's got a fantastic skill-set, second to none – and I've seen a lot of centres in my time,\" Davies said.</p><p>The player sought to downplay expectations about his hopes of playing in the autumn. \"Getting back into the mix with England was what I set out to do at the start of the season,\" he said. \"All I could do was play really well and hopefully be in contention. I got a few injuries last season that put me off track so it's good to be back in there.  The three autumn Tests are all massive games and it would be an experience if I were to be selected for any of those.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420161196|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|f1ffac001acab29e6a4f2fd7b76f042a1019b9c9 -->",

Johnson offers Lancaster cover for Tom Wood on the blindside flank with Tom Croft ruled out for the season with a knee injury.</p><p>Alex Corbisiero is included in the squad despite also picking up a knee problem that could rule him out of the start of the series, which begins against Australia on 2 November at Twickenham followed by games on successive weekends against Argentina and world champions New Zealand. Lancaster expects the prop, who has had fluid drained from the knee that has troubled him in recent seasons, and will not be able to put weight on it for another week, to be back in action in a few weeks.</p><p>\"We have not ruled out Alex from any of next month's internationals,\" said Lancaster. \"He has to put his knee up this week as part of his rehab. I hope he will come through and be available for some if not all of the matches. I am optimistic about his long-term prospects: with good management, we can see him through beyond 2015.\"</p><p>Lancaster will decide his captain when the squad gathers next week having refused to answer speculation that he would be replacing one back rower, Chris Robshaw, for another, Tom Wood. He said he was happy with the form of his players, but nearly half the squad, 16, are playing for clubs who were wither poor or fickle in the first five weeks of the season, including Robshaw's Harlequins.</p><p>The squad will assemble in Leeds next Monday after this weekend's Heineken Cup games for a pre-series camp.</p><p>Speaking at Lloyd's of London, Lancaster said: \"We have been looking forward to this QBE Internationals series ever since we got back from Argentina. As a coaching group we have watched a lot of rugby and we are pleased with the form of the squad. The camp is an important part of our preparation and we are looking forward to meeting up.</p><p>\"Inevitably there have been some injuries and there is still a big European weekend ahead. But injures always create opportunities and we are pleased to call up Tom Johnson, Joel Tomkins, Henry Trinder and Luther Burrell into the senior EPS, with Luther joining us as injury cover.

He had been preparing for a match against the All Blacks on 2 November and complained of a headache on Tuesday night when he returned to Tokyo from an inspection of the Brave Blossoms' training camp.</p><p>White, among Jones's closest friends, told  <a href=\"http://keo.co.za/2013/10/16/jones-suffers-stroke/\" title=\"\">Keo.co.za</a> that he had spoken to his wife and that the positive was that he was able to speak.</p><p>\"He is in intensive care and he currently doesn't have movement on his left side but he is talking and, typical of Eddie, it's about the challenge of the All Blacks and the subsequent European tour,\" White said. \"My understanding is he will be in intensive care for at least the next week.\"</p><p>White saw Jones, who is only 53, in Durban last week and was shocked by the news. \"My prayers and thoughts are with him, as I am sure will be the case with all those who know him and have had the privilege of working with him,\" said White. <strong> </strong></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420114866|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|e41b65fd14b4c50d5aeb081ee81946246c8faa8d -->",

        "body":"<p>The Wallabies are poised to accept pay cuts as the Australian Rugby Union takes dire financial blows.</p><p>A new collective bargaining agreement is set to end the days of Australian players earning a guaranteed $14,000 per Test – win, lose or draw.</p><p>The ARU's survival is at stake as it sits in a perilous financial position after recording a $19m deficit in the past two years and a worrying slump in support for rugby union in Australia.</p><p>The Wallabies' dismal results this year – winning just three of their nine Tests to drop to No4 in the world – have also impacted on attendances and sponsorship.</p><p>In eight months since replacing John O'Neill as ARU chief executive, Bill Pulver, in his own words, has \"brutally attacked the cost base\" by making cuts across the board.</p><p>Even a welcome windfall from the British and Irish Lions tour hasn't balanced the books at the ARU. Pulver has already slashed employee numbers and also made significant cutbacks to the high-performance unit and shelved the national academies in Brisbane and Sydney.</p><p>\"My first six months at the ARU a lot of my time has been spent ripping costs out of the place basically,\" said Pulver. \"It's not been a lot of fun but it's been a very important cleansing experience. From a financial perspective we're going to be skating on thin ice for the next couple of years. Can we get through? Yes, we can. Is it going to be bloody hard? Yes, it is.\"</p><p>Warnings of cuts to club rugby have made Pulver, looking to develop a new third-tier national competition, unpopular in club circles but he's making no apologies for taking drastic measures for the good of the game.</p><p>A reduction of player salaries has firmly been on the agenda and should be revealed in the next two months when a new CBA, the first since 2005, is expected to be finalised. The ARU board meets on Monday to discuss ongoing negotiations with the Rugby Union Players Association.</p><p>Both Pulver and RUPA boss Greg Harris confirmed Test match payments – which would currently see a Wallaby earn $196,000 if he played all 15 Tests this year on top of his salary – were among issues being addressed.</p><p>Former World Cup-winning skipper Nick Farr-Jones has led calls for incentive-based pay, claiming Wallabies should be paid far less for defeats.<br />Harris said the players union were taking a conciliatory approach to ensure the game didn't go under.</p><p>\"Player directors have been united in their commitment in trying to assist the game in trying to confront the financial issues,\" Harris said. The last time a new CBA was drafted, in 2005, the code was in rude health with $35m in the ARU war chest and crowd numbers which had it challenging rugby league as Australia's No.2 code.</p><p>Harris hinted top players benefited from a generous deal in the prosperous times.</p><p>\"My predecessor [Tony Dempsey] did a very good job of negotiating for the players when the dams were full and there was plenty of water around but we have a drought at the moment so we all have to drink a little bit less,\" he said. \"The players are being very responsible.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420091121|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|83eba164ed869bb0bcd9138776e0f038f1a9c107 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>You only play in the front row</strong> if you're prepared to be confrontational. You also can't be a loner – you're relying on the two guys next to you for your safety, because people can get badly hurt in the scrum.</p><p><strong>A lot of the maxims that are good for sport do not help you in life.</strong> For instance: \"Never give up, never quit…\"</p><p><strong>I'm adopted, so I'm not like my parents.</strong> But I keep aspiring to their values, of tolerance, of quiet dignity, of work ethic, of decency.</p><p><strong>Sport is very simple: you win or you lose.</strong> There's a comfort in that. But nothing is ever like that again. It's come as a bit of a shock to me: life is not black and white and if you try to live it like that you're going to be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Being a lawyer teaches you to argue rationally.</strong> [Moore is a trained solicitor.] It drives me crazy when people argue with non-sequiturs.</p><p><strong>Someone will always be richer than you,</strong> someone will be better looking. I'm trying to learn to value my achievements, but my head is always saying the next one is the only one that matters. I can't control my competitive streak.</p><p><strong>I'm actually quite an angry man.</strong> The thing that makes me angry at the moment it is people not answering questions. Politicians, local authorities, people from quangos… There's a whole industry teaching people not to answer things, not to tell the truth.</p><p><strong>There's a tendency in this country</strong> for people to be vicariously offended. Get over it: if you're offended by something, stop thinking and reading about it.</p><p><strong>The Lions tour is special</strong> in a way that people who haven't been round it can't really understand. The players who are there are all used to being number one in their country, they're not used to fighting for a place continually.</p><p><strong>You can't buy anything in life that's really important,</strong> and you can't force it either. People's affection, people's friendship – they're not commodities.</p><p><strong>The best I've ever felt on a rugby field</strong> was when David Campese dropped the ball behind his line in the third Test of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOCN4dkyvp4\" title=\"\">Lions series in 1989</a> to make us the first and only Lions side to lose the first Test in a series and still win. That was a very pleasing moment, especially because it was David.</p><p><strong>If I've ever been truly happy </strong>it's been in those fleeting moments you can't manufacture, like this one day we were on the beach in Cornwall and the children designed a sphinx out of sand.</p><p><strong>When I </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianmoore666\" title=\"\"><strong>tweet</strong></a><strong> about opera,</strong> people say: \"Oh, trying to show off are we?\" I say no, it's all culture, it's just that my culture's different to yours. Give me the <em>Magic Flute</em> and a bottle of 1982 Saint-Émilion.</p><p><strong>I had a great wedding day.</strong> Well, I had a few. I'm on my third one, and they were all great.</p><p><br /><em>Brian Moore is part of talkSPORT's commentary team for the British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia on 1089/1053am and DAB (</em><a href=\"http://www.talksport.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>talkSPORT.co.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410093083|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|12714e7d9e4b29feac5e35aeddf34278cd52c644 -->",

        "headline":"Jonny Wilkinson kicks Toulon to Heineken Cup final win over Clermont",
        "body":"<p>On the day of reckoning, an all-French final, the side that had not lost a single game in the Heineken Cup did just that, failing against Jonny Wilkinson's Toulon. Clermont will be wondering how on earth they let slip a game they seized by the scruff after half-time. Mathieu Bastareaud, who tackled his way to the man of the match award, will not care a jot how his team scrambled to victory. For the record, two Englishmen scored the points that mattered: Wilkinson 11 from three penalties and a conversion, and Delon Armitage with a try.</p><p>For the first 15 minutes there was thunder on the ground, a man-made alternative to any storm in the skies. Rain that had been forecast but wisely kept its distance. The tacklers advanced furiously and the ball-carriers were swept back. The body has become the new object in the game that can be picked up and tossed around. During this period of Rollerball, the two little figures of Wilkinson and Mogan Parra remained sufficiently intact to land a penalty each</p><p>Mercifully for the shoulders of the Toulon captain, the game sprang the locks on its shackles even before the first quarter was out. He had to make a tackle less juddering than the head-on variety when he raced back to stop Wesley Fofana, the centre who was on full alert now that there was a little bit less suffocation. Clermont had others now hungry for the ball. Sitiveni Sivivatu roamed away from the touchline and was slipped a pass that put him into a postage stamp of space. The ex-All Black was stopped only by a tackle of athletic agility by Andrew Sheridan, the prop propelling himself horizontally at the wing.</p><p>Lee Byrne brought a different kind of threat from full-back, chasing and gathering his own kick, a glimpse of his speciality in the Wales grand slam campaign of 2005.</p><p>That was how the openness expressed itself, in snatches, flashes, echoes of days of greater freedom. But nothing lasted; no runner could run clear of the scrambling tacklers.</p><p>Not until Rudi Wulf spilt the ball near the touchline on halfway and Clermont pounced, releasing Brock James. The Australian is not the quickest in the universe but he found himself in a race, in pursuit of his own kick ahead, with Chris Masoe, more hulk than whippet. James beat the No8 but not the dead-ball line. Video review led to a 22 drop-out and the game turned around at half-time still at 3-3.</p><p>The deadlock lasted 90 seconds into the second half. Again, Clermont swooped when they had a whiff of space but this time Toulon could not plug the gap opened up by Aurélien Rougerie in particular, the centre pulling in two defenders before releasing the ball to Napolioni Nalaga, the leading try-scorer in the Heineken Cup this season. It was another straight race, Clermont player against a last defender and a line – the touchline this time. Nalaga won.</p><p>Toulon needed to score quickly as if to give themselves a point of restart in this second half. Wilkinson obliged after a maul was hauled down. Toulon were back, but only until the combination of James and Rougerie struck again. More time passed than 90 seconds but not much when James dinked a little kick over the Toulon three-quarters and Rougerie barged past Wilkinson to regather and slip another fine pass to James. Now there was nobody between the outside-half and the line. Parra added the conversion.</p><p>Toulon rang the changes, taking off Danie Rossouw, who had had a clumsy game, and replacing one ex-Springbok with another, Joe van Niekerk. The 38-year-old Sébastien Bruno left too, the old – Toulon are not exactly in their first flush – giving way to the less venerable. The most influential change was to be Frédéric Michalak, on at scrum-half, and kicking into space to give his team something to pursue in a positive direction. James, retreating, gave away a penalty and Wilkinson reduced the gap to six points.</p><p>Clermont still seemed to be more comfortable with the ball in hand, but Toulon took a leaf from that opening chapter, when to have a body in hand was the name of the game. Fofana set off on a run but was brought down by Bakkies Botha and Van Niekerk. Sivivatu fumbled the pick-up and was stripped by Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe.</p><p>The Argentine wing-forward delivered a one-handed pass to Armitage who strolled over for Toulon's first try in the knock-out stages. Wilkinson converted, not the most difficult kick of his career, but at the end of his penultimate season, for a club that has revitalised his extraordinary career, this mattered.</p><p>He delivered and, remarkably, Toulon were in the lead by a point with 16 minutes left to play.</p><p>They held on, Bastareaud charging down a drop-goal attempt by James, and Sivivatu throwing the last, the very last, try-scoring pass forward. Jonny Wilkinson, king of the elder statesman, had his hands on the Heineken Cup</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409110418|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|e9e30955c3129fb3423c89b63c0b07906e158175 -->",

        "headline":"Prince Harry to lead push to expand rugby into inner-city schools",
        "body":"<p>It takes its name from a famous private school and, for some, has long been associated with the Barbour-wearing, Range Rover-driving masses that throng Twickenham whenever England play.</p><p>As part of an effort to change that image the Rugby Football Union (RFU) has launched a new drive to get hundreds more state schools, many of them in inner cities, playing the game to make the most of a hoped-for boom in its profile around the 2015 Rugby World Cup, which will be staged in England.</p><p>Apparently without irony, the Old Etonian Prince Harry has been named as the <a href=\"http://www.rfu.com/news/2013/march/news-articles/070313_all_schools_patron\" title=\"\">patron for the All Schools scheme</a>, with the aim of getting 400 more state schools playing the game by 2015 and 750 more playing by 2019.</p><p>Clusters of three or four schools will be targeted and provided with kit, equipment and resources by the RFU as well as being linked with a local club, which will also provide coaching and ongoing support.</p><p>Steve Grainger, RFU rugby development director, said the programme was aimed both at schools that used to play the game but had dropped the habit and those that had never taken it up, seeking to provide coaching education for teachers who had never played or taught the game.</p><p>\"One of our aims up to 2015 and beyond is to broaden the reach of the game and ensure it is a game that can be played by everyone. It can have a real impact on a school not only from a sporting perspective, but from a behaviour perspective, a values perspective, a discipline perspective,\" he said.</p><p>The RFU estimates that of a total of just over 3,000 secondary schools, about half of them play some form of rugby and about 750 of those play competitive fixtures against other schools.</p><p>Grainger, who was previously chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, acknowledged that the government's decision to axe £162m in ringfenced funding for a network of school sport partnerships had made the task more difficult but said rugby benefited from a network of willing clubs and volunteers.</p><p>\"We're talking about a three-year investment from us to sustain rugby in these schools. We're not only looking for willing schools, we're looking for willing clubs that have got some capacity and a commitment to work with schools,\" said Grainger.</p><p>In developing links between clubs and schools, the hope is that children can graduate to clubs and help to arrest a decline in the number of teenagers playing competitive rugby, despite a boom in younger children playing \"mini rugby\". Grainger said that many of those chosen would be \"inner-city schools\" in some \"pretty tough environments\".</p><p>\"This is a great way to bring in some new players, some new parents, some new volunteers and new coaches through those teenage years and demonstrating that rugby has as much, if not more, to offer than many other sports.\"</p><p>Those without facilities will be provided with rugby posts or linked with clubs where they can play and the benefits of touch rugby and sevens will also be emphasised for those who may not be suited to the full-contact sport.</p><p>Grainger said: \"There is a perception still that it is an independent school sport. But if you look at the 23 players in the matchday squad against France and take out the three that were educated overseas, 13 of those guys came from the state sector.\"</p><p>The initiative is part of a wider drive to bring rugby union to parts of the country where it is traditionally less popular, ahead of the 2015 World Cup, which will be staged largely in big Premier League football grounds around England.</p><p>The final list of venues will be confirmed on Friday but Old Trafford in Manchester, Elland Road in Leeds, Newcastle's St James' Park and St Mary's in Southampton are among those on the long list.</p><p>\"I don't think there's a perception that it's a poor relation to football, but it just doesn't get the same degree of exposure. One of the things we're finding is that local rugby clubs tend to have an identity in the community that football clubs don't. We're trying to position them at the heart of their local community,\" said Grainger.</p><p>There is an acknowledgement that the RFU failed to capitalise on a surge in popularity for the sport when Sir Clive Woodward led England to the 2003 World Cup and is determined not to repeat the mistakes of that era.</p><p>Before Sunday's Six Nations tie against Italy at Twickenham, which England are expected to win to set up the possibility of a grand slam decider against Wales at the Millennium Stadium, 100 participating state schools will be presented with a rugby shirt made to their own design as part of a programme to learn about the \"core values of rugby\".</p><p>A St James's Palace spokesperson said: \"This patronage will allow Prince Harry to combine his passion for rugby with his work to help children and young people in society to build their skills, confidence and aspirations. Prince Harry recognises that rugby can play an important role in helping to achieve this.\"</p><p>Grainger insisted there was no irony in the appointment of Prince Harry, a regular visitor to Twickenham, as patron: \"This is about adding genuine weight and genuine profile, and hopefully other people getting the opportunities that he had.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405260609|2013-10-17T16:29:03Z|bab6e1c9583e23060412d32824c24e225e0a48a5 -->",
