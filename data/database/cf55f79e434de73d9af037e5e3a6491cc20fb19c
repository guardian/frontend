        "trailText":"<p>Leicester fought back to steal a 19-19 draw with Northampton as Courtney Lawes shone for the visitors in their Premiership clash at Welford Road</p>",
        "headline":"Courtney Lawes is a resurgent force in Northampton's draw at Leicester",
        "body":"<p>The majority of draws satisfy no one but this brutal contest suggested England's leading players will take some knocking over in their looming Heineken Cup and November international campaigns. Northampton, in particular, currently fear no one and their thunderous road trip this weekend to the French champions Castres should be some collision.</p><p>Even the powerful All Blacks and Springboks might be advised to brace themselves for the impact of Courtney Lawes, the resurgent England lock who is not only threatening to shake the autumn leaves from every tree in the East Midlands but is also applying his prodigious power more thoughtfully. On this evidence the 24-year-old Lawes, who has just become a father following the birth of a daughter last week, is finally maturing into the world-class force he aspires to be.</p><p>Had he, and the similarly hard-running Luther Burrell, stayed on the field for the full game it is unlikely Leicester would have been in a position to stage the brave fightback which earned them an unlikely draw from 19-9 down. Lawes, despite his yellow card for slowing the ball down at a ruck, is playing with more discipline and is contributing on a more consistent basis as a result.</p><p>\"I am maturing a little bit and realising you don't have to make a massive hit every tackle,\" he said while deservedly clutching the man-of-the-match award. \"I have certainly done that in the past and it affects your game when you are starting matches with bad shoulders. I feel great and feel I can now really push on and find my potential.\"</p><p>If Burrell's own injured right shoulder had not forced him off prematurely, the Saints would surely have secured their first win over the Tigers in nine attempts. Burrell was also unfortunate to be sent to the sin-bin in the first half for a supposedly dangerous tackle on Anthony Allen which, to most onlookers, was nothing of the sort. \"I hate that law … it doesn't make any sense to me,\" sighed Tom Wood, the visitors' frustrated flanker, making the point that ball carriers instinctively seek to go to ground as quickly as possible regardless of the tackler's actions.</p><p>\"As a player I know that, when I am the ball carrier, the second my feet come off the ground I'm diving head-first for the ground deliberately to make sure the ball comes back our way.\"</p><p>Wood, at the head of the queue of contenders to captain England next month, also believes rugby will suffer if too many big hits are legislated out of the sport. \"It would be a real shame not to have that in the game. You've put a big hit in, one of your players has driven one of their players back and it feels like a real positive in the game. Then all of a sudden you're down to 14 men and defending for your lives. I felt like it was a fair tackle in real time.\"</p><p>The crooked lineout throw which prefaced the Tigers' dramatic late relieving try by the wholehearted Ed Slater was another bone of contention for the Northampton hierarchy but, as their director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, conceded afterwards, refereeing derby matches of this intensity is horribly fraught. Saturday's official, JP Doyle, must have felt at times as if he was in charge of the mosh pit at a heavy-metal gig; the decibel count as Leicester, driven on by their persevering forwards and the influential Toby Flood, cranked up the pressure was remarkable even by Welford Road standards.</p><p>Despite Louis Deacon's 70th-minute sin-binning for backchat, the champions could have sneaked it at the end had the ball not popped out of an advancing scrum near the visiting line. The Saints, though, deserved at least a share of the spoils.</p><p>In the shape of their outstanding No8 Stuart Dickinson, try-scoring prop Alex Corbisiero, scrum-half Lee Dickson and George Pisi they have players in form at a timely stage of the season who could spell trouble for Castres, Leinster and Ospreys in a heavy-duty Heineken Cup pool. If there is a caveat, it is that Dylan Hartley's men are still not quite finishing opponents off in the final quarter. Had they not been pipped late on by Gloucester at Kingsholm and won here, they would be level with Saracens at the top of the table rather than six points behind.</p><p>Leicester, for their part, are still without Manu Tuilagi, Steve Mafi and Mathew Tait, while Geoff Parling was a late withdrawal with a sore hip. The Lions lock is expected to be fit, however, for Friday's opening European encounter with Ulster at Ravenhill, not one of their favourite venues. This time, at least, they will travel forewarned and battle-hardened.</p><p><strong>Leicester</strong> Morris; Scully (Bowden, 7), Goneva, Allen, Thompstone; Flood (capt), B Youngs (Mele, 69); Mulipola,  T Youngs, Cole, Deacon, Kitchener, Slater, Salvi, Crane.</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Slater <strong>Con</strong> Flood <strong>Pens</strong> Flood 4.</p><p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Deacon 70.</p><p><strong>Northampton</strong> Foden; Elliott, Pisi, Burrell (Wilson, 69), North; Myler, Dickson; Corbisiero (Denman, 63), Hartley (capt), Mercey (Waller, 63), Manoa, Lawes, Wood, Dowson (Clark, 55), Dickinson.</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Corbisiero <strong>Con</strong> Myler <strong>Pens</strong> Myler 4.</p><p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Burrell 19, Lawes 70.</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> JP Doyle. <strong>Attendance</strong> 23,891.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194765|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|dba33ca1ae7c2f471f622e9edf74b7ce584a17a5 -->",

        "headline":"Dean Ryan says Worcester's problem is a question of confidence",
        "body":"<p>Worcester fly to the Alps this week for a European meeting with Oyonnax, the surprise package of the French league, totally lacking in confidence, according to their new director of rugby, Dean Ryan.</p><p>After a fifth defeat in the Premiership  his side are rooted at the bottom of the league, already seven points adrift with possible relegation on their minds and a chairman begging fans for patience.</p><p>Ryan has a squad largely bequeathed by Richard Hill, his predecessor who was sacked in the spring, and little wriggle room in the transfer market before the end of the season. The only bright spot is the arrival of a quartet of Argentinian internationals, three of whom were signed by Hill but whose involvement will be limited before Christmas by the demands of Argentina in the Rugby Championship which ended on Saturday with defeat by Australia and in an autumn Test season which starts at Twickenham, moves to Cardiff and ends in Naples.</p><p>With Worcester due to play league games against Exeter, Bath, Sale and Northampton during that Test window, it is understandable that Cecil Duckworth, chairman and long-time benefactor, asked for patience while throwing his weight 100% behind Ryan. \"I and the board always wanted to attract a top coaching team and now we have one of the very best and we are confident they will deliver.\"</p><p>However, it is confidence which Ryan says is most lacking when refereeing decisions go against them, as they did against Newcastle. Ryan said he will not start using an \"excuse culture\" but conceded: \"It's pretty obvious that losing games, and in the manner we lost today and against London Irish, saps confidence but we can only control ourselves. I am not going to get into the excuse culture.</p><p>\"We can't buy a win at the moment. The challenge here is to be competitive regularly. There have been times when we haven't been and at times we were today. We've got to get better at managing things. We haven't got a group that is confident week in, week out of getting all those pieces of the jigsaw right.\"</p><p>And that summed up Saturday when Worcester were 10 points down after eight minutes, still 13–3 down at the interval and struggling to reap the rewards of their pressure at the end. The Samoan wing, David Lemi, did squeeze home in the 69th minute and his partners in the back three, Josh Drauniniu and Chris Pennell, might have done better with more ball and better decision-making, but that was it.</p><p>Newcastle, who have developed into a team under Dean Richards, survived by waiting for Worcester to make mistakes, and headed home with a second away win and a bit of a cushion for when Ryan's fortunes change, as Richards thinks they will.</p><p>\"When I came up with Harlequins we lost the first six and everyone was writing that we would be relegated,\" said Richards. \"You only have to look at the quality of Worcester's squad to see they are not going to be at the bottom at the end of the season. They just need a bit of a break, which will happen at some stage, and they will start climbing the ladder.\"</p><p><strong>Worcester</strong> Pennell; Drauniniu, Fatiaki (Grove, 19), Matavese, Lemi; Mieres (Warwick, 53), Hodgson (Su'a,47); Becasseau (Porter, 53), Shervinton (Brooker, 53), Murray (Andress, 66), Williams, Jones, Thomas (capt), Abbott, Taulava (Goodhue, 48).</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Lemi <strong>Pens</strong> Mieres 2.</p><p><strong>Newcastle</strong> Tait; Cato, Powell, Fitzpatrick, Catterick; Clegg (Godman, 70), Blair (Fury, 70); Vickers (Montanella, 45; Vickers, 66), Thompson (McGuigan, 48), Tomaszczyk (Wilson, 66), Del Fava (Tomes, 75), Barrow, Wilson, Welch (capt; York, 45), Hogg.</p><p><strong>Try</strong> Blair. <strong>Con</strong> Clegg. <strong>Pens</strong> Clegg 2, Godman.</p><p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Tomaszczyk 36.</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> M Fox. <strong>Attendance</strong> 6,415.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419183657|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|7955dedf3b05e8b573056d1feb73ad6e3b7864ca -->",

        "body":"<p>Will Fraser was delighted to make a try-scoring return and strengthen Saracens' position at the top of the table after his rapid recovery from an injury more common among rodeo riders than rugby players. Fraser bucked the predictions of his surgeon, who thought he would struggle to  return before November, and was in the thick of the action on his first day back in the saddle.</p><p>\"It was great in my first game back to score, and to get through a whole game does the world of good for my confidence,\" the openside said. \"I was pretty rusty in a few areas so there is a lot to work on.\"</p><p>\"I tore my left lat off the bone. I was told it's an injury a lot of rodeo riders and water sports athletes get because of all the pulling on the arms, but mine was an impact injury. They reckon I'm the only rugby player to have ever done it. Because of that there was a lot of leeway in terms of my comeback. The surgeon said November but he couldn't be sure and there was no real way of telling.\"</p><p>Fraser is in the England Saxons squad and had hopes of touring Argentina with England in the summer before picking up the injury against Gloucester in April but he is currently thinking only of regaining his form with his club.</p><p>\"It's great to think I'm still in the thoughts of the England set-up but at the moment it's just about playing well for my club and if anything comes off the back of that then great,\" he said.</p><p>An ultimately comfortable win for Saracens, though Wasps earned a bonus point thanks to a last-minute Chris Bell try when Chris Ashton had been sent to the sin-bin, took some time in coming. It needed the introduction of the England fly-half, Owen Farrell, to make the home side's superiority count. Farrell had been rested along with 11 other starters from the win at Harlequins last time out, but he was the first of the reinforcements to come off the bench as Wasps proved a tough nut to crack.</p><p>He was introduced at half-time with the score 3-0 thanks to an Alex Goode penalty and within five minutes he had instigated the move that saw Fraser dive over for his side's only try. Wasps soon responded as Bell finished after a run by Christian Wade but it always appeared Saracens could move into another gear and Farrell had made the match safe with three penalties before Bell's final flourish.</p><p>By that stage the benches had been almost emptied but Fraser remained in the fray, fully testing his recovery.</p><p>While Fraser has his international ambitions on hold, the Wasps' England second row Joe Launchbury is relishing the prospect of the autumn internationals. \"It's a really hard group of games but I'm really looking forward to getting back with the squad and pushing forward from the Argentina trip.\"</p><p>Launchbury came off with five minutes to go thanks to a knock on the head, but he insisted it was precautionary and that he will be ready for the matches against Australia, Argentina and New Zealand in November: \"I'll be fit. It's just a knock on the head and because it was so close to the end they decided it was best to keep me off.\"</p><p>In the more immediate term, though, Launchbury expressed concern after Wasps' fourth defeat in five. \"We are massively frustrated again. We don't want to be the sort of side who are happy with getting bonus points. We need to start turning some of these close things into wins.\"</p><p><strong>Saracens</strong> Ransom (Farrell, h-t); Ashton, Tomkins (Wilson, 75), Wyles, Tagicakibau; Alex Goode, De Kock (Wigglesworth, 50); Gill (M Vunipola, 66), George (Brits, 53), Johnston (Du Plessis, 60), Hargreaves (Botha, 66), Kruis, Wray (Brown, 50), Fraser, Joubert (capt).</p><p><strong>Try </strong>Fraser. <strong>Con </strong>Farrell. <strong>Pens </strong>Goode, Farrell 3</p><p><strong>London Wasps </strong>Daly (Andy Goode, h-t); Wade, Bell (capt), Hayter, Bassett; Carlisle, Davies; Mullan (McIntyre, 63), Festuccia (Lindsay, 54), Cooper-Woolley (Taylor, 65), Launchbury (Myall, 72), K Myall (Cannon, 69), Jackson, Johnson (Thompson, 63), Hughes.</p><p><strong>Tries </strong>Bell 2. <strong>Con </strong>Goode.</p><p><strong>Referee </strong>L Pearce (RFU) <strong>Attendance </strong>9,642.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419177043|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|1b5df88dbb771fcca6c0e1101f03210c8d9cb035 -->",

        "body":"<p>Exeter started the day one off the bottom of the Premiership and finished it in the top half. A characteristic of most of the teams outside the leading three is an ability to recover quickly from setbacks, consistent only in their inconsistency, but Exeter's metamorphosis from passive against Leicester the previous week to aggressive in a dominant display that silenced the Shed  was extraordinary.</p><p>The scoreline flattered Gloucester. Gareth Steenson missed three eminently kickable penalties in the first 23 minutes and Exeter felt Hoane Tui should have been awarded a try just before the interval when the television match official ruled the prop had not grounded the ball on the line. More than that, the Chiefs dominated the scrum and the breakdown and their use of runners operating from deep, such as the centre Sam Hill and the No8, Dave Ewers, baffled an unresponsive home side throughout.</p><p>Gloucester played as if they expected the game to swing their way without having to make it happen. They were betrayed by carelessness throughout and even when they took the lead for the only time in the game, at the end of the first quarter, it was the result of a clever move, Billy Twelvetrees freeing the full-back, Martyn Thomas, with an inside pass, rather than of sustained pressure.</p><p>Exeter had had most of the ball but, with Steenson uncharacteristically wayward from the tee, had only a penalty to show for their possession and position. Matt Kvesic, one of Gloucester's four mooted England squad players, conceded a needless penalty near halfway after trying to enhance an attack with a jersey tug on a defender off the ball. Exeter used the resulting lineout to drive to the Gloucester line where they won another breakdown penalty which Steenson converted.</p><p>The Chiefs immediately returned to the attack and, after the prop Rupert Harden conceded a penalty at a scrum, they again exploited Gloucester's fragile defence of the gainline with the flanker Ben White touching the ball down in the act of dropping it.</p><p>The home crowd was too stunned at half-time to boo off Gloucester, who were only 13-5 down despite being comprehensively outplayed. They had replaced Harden four minutes from the break as they prepared to defend a five-metre scrum: he had been penalised at two of the set pieces and had become both a yellow card and a penalty-try risk.</p><p>If Harden personified Gloucester's discomfiture, his opposite number, Brett Sturgess, reflected all that was good about Exeter. He not only helped his side win six penalties at the scrum but constantly made himself available on the inside shoulder of runners and he made a try-saving tackle on Twelvetrees at a point in the second half when Gloucester looked to be in the market for a comeback.</p><p>One move in the first half summed up Exeter: Hill received the ball in his own 22, taking up a position behind the first line of attack; by the time he met the first defender, Freddie Burns, he had got into a gallop and the England Under-20 international made 30 metres before Ewers and Sturgess took the move into Gloucester territory.</p><p>Hill is one of a number of players who have broken into the first team from the club's academy. \"It is the young ones who are leading the way,\" said the Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter. \"The older lads are following.\"</p><p>Exeter did exploit their experience: the second-row Dean Mumm led with authority, Tom Johnson helped make the breakdown as uncomfortable for Gloucester as the scrum and the wing Tom James regularly made tackle-breaking bursts into midfield.</p><p>Apart from one spell in the second period when they took play through 20 phases, Gloucester were unable to shake their supporters out of a feeling of stunned disbelief.</p><p>Their playmakers were largely marginal figures, Burns and Twelvetrees both guilty of reacting to the scarcity of possession by not keeping it simple when the ball did reach them, but it was at forward where they were exposed.</p><p>\"We are always on the look-out for recruits,\" said their director of rugby, Nigel Davies, when asked if he would be signing forward reinforcements. \"The penalties we conceded [17] were a product of the pressure we were under and the scrum has been a concern for the last couple of games. As a unit we are not performing and personnel make a difference. We have to man up.\"</p><p>Gloucester slipped to two off the bottom, above Wasps, and a concern for Davies will be that his team were a distant second even though conditions should have been in their favour: dry and sunny with a firm surface.</p><p>They were 23-5 down in 63 minutes when Mumm was driven over after Exeter opted for a lineout rather than a kick at goal. The replacement Jonny May replied for Gloucester with his first touch of the ball after Burns's inside pass but two Steenson penalties sealed a remarkably comfortable victory.</p><p><strong>Gloucester</strong> M Thomas; Sharples (May, 64), Tindall, Twelvetrees, Simpson-Daniel; Burns, Knoyle (Robson, 63); Y Thomas (Murphy, 49), Dawidiuk (Edmonds, 64), Harden (Knight, 36), Savage (capt; Stooke, 56), Hudson, Kalamafoni, Kvesic (Qera, 57), Morgan (Evans, 56).</p><p><strong>Tries</strong> M Thomas, May <strong>Con</strong> Burns.</p><p><strong>Exeter</strong> Dollman; Jess, Whitten, Hill (Slade, 67), James (Vainikolo, 73); Steenson, Lewis (H Thomas, 52); Sturgess (Moon, 64), Whitehead (Yeandle, 55), Tui (Rimmer, 64) Mumm (capt), Welch (Armand, 74), Johnson, White (Horstmann, 61), Ewers.</p><p><strong>Tries</strong> White, Mumm <strong>Cons</strong> Steenson 2 <strong>Pens</strong> Steenson 5.</p><p><strong>Referee</strong> M Carley. <strong>Attendance </strong>14,582.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192074|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|b8035af71ea6a5ced7b7d8470f3c9a6218edda0d -->",

        "body":"<p>The Wallabies benefitted from a brilliant performance from Israel Folau to surge to a 54-17 win over Argentina and avoid the Rugby Championship wooden spoon.</p><p>Folau scored a hat-trick of tries among a seven-try haul as the Wallabies finally shook off the shackles and delivered their attacking promise.</p><p>It was Australia's second win from six matches under new coach Ewen McKenzie and while far from flawless, it was a marked improvement on last week's heavy loss to the Springboks.</p><p>\"It's a real confidence booster for us,\" the Wallabies skipper James Horwill said. \"The team played very well. One to 15 all put in an effort and we're very pleased.\"</p><p>The Wallabies showed their intention to play a running game from the start and Folau put his side on the scoreboard in the third minute after some neat lead-up work from Quade Cooper and Joe Tomane.</p><p>It silenced the raucous Estadio Gigante de Arroyito crowd but they were on their feet soon after as the Pumas did their best to assert themselves at the scrum.</p><p>Over eight minutes the teams packed seven scrums five metres from the tryline as referee Wayne Barnes blew five penalties.</p><p>He also yellow-carded loosehead prop James Slipper for repeated infringements but the Australians somehow managed to escape without conceding any points.</p><p>After the teams exchanged penalties for a 10-3 scoreline, the Wallabies made the most of Argentina losing flanker Pablo Matera to the sin-bin for a shoulder charge on a rampaging Scott Fardy.</p><p>Christian Leali'ifano slotted another penalty and then Folau beat his man to off-load to Adam Ashley-Cooper, who raced 20 metres to dive across the line.</p><p>Two minutes later Folau showed his class when he slipped through the Pumas defence untouched with the Wallabies out to a 25-3 lead.</p><p>The Pumas kept in touch however, Folau proving only human as he missed the tackle on centre Marcelo Bosch as he raced to touch down.</p><p>Leali'ifano didn't return for the second half due to a knee injury, with Matt Toomua on at inside centre but the loss didn't unsettle the visitors.</p><p>With hooker Stephen Moore and Horwill in the thick of the action, the Wallabies worked the ball to Cooper and Folau was in again for his third thanks to a no-look pass from Cooper.</p><p>While the Pumas managed another try to hal-fback Martin Landajo, it was otherwise one-way traffic.</p><p>Tomane got some reward for his busy game with a try at at the end of a 50m run, while reserve prop Benn Robinson and debutant Bernard Foley also crossed to cap a well-deserved win.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419162945|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|a0410cd0ef517e0139d522e5beb6ac39bc6a48c7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Lost in the dust storm that blew up when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/03/lions-alun-wyn-jones-australia-series-decider\" title=\"\">Brian O'Driscoll was dropped by the Lions</a> for the third, series-deciding Test against Australia three months ago was any acknowledgement that the player who was chosen ahead of him, Jonathan Davies, had had a career-defining tour and was in the side on merit.</p><p>Lions tours invariably make reputations. Mike Teague in 1989, Scott Gibbs in 1993, Tom Smith in 1997, Rob Henderson in 2001, Ryan Jones in 2005 and Jamie Roberts in 2009 all returned home with their stock higher than when they arrived in the southern hemisphere and it was so with Davies who, during the Six Nations, was criticised by Wales for a passing ability considered to be inadequate for an outside-centre.</p><p>As the Lions head coach Warren Gatland and the attack coach Rob Howley both acknowledged after the tour, Davies  profited from training for nearly two months with the player he was to displace at 13, O'Driscoll. The Scarlets' captain showed in the warm-up matches passing and handling skills that had been largely latent until then and he returned to Wales a complete centre.</p><p>\"He made huge strides and he is a player I am looking forward to seeing him playing in the Test arena this season,\" said Gerald Davies, the chairman of the Lions committee and part of the victorious squad in New Zealand in 1971. \"At the start of every Lions tour, you know that reputations will be made and broken: it is all about making the step up from an international team to one which is made up of the cream of four&nbsp;nations.</p><p>\"Some find the experience overwhelming, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/06/australia-lions-third-test-match-report\" title=\"\">Jonathan took it in his stride</a>. I have to admit that he was not the best passer of the ball when he arrived in Australia, but he kept working on it and it is now part and parcel of his game. Some players spend their careers in the shadows of the truly great, but what we saw in those few weeks down under was the physical and psychological emergence of someone I expect to be a major player for Wales in the coming years. The key to success on a Lions tour is to pick on form, not reputation, and he fully deserved his place in the Test side.\"</p><p>The 25-year-old Davies is in the final year of his contract with the Scarlets. He has said that he wants to remain in Wales, despite interest from outside, but with the future of the Heineken Cup uncertain, the four Welsh regions, who face losing 25% of their income, are unable to commit themselves financially and talks with such leading players as Davies, Leigh Halfpenny, Sam Warburton, Alun Wyn Jones and Adam Jones, who were all part of the Lions' success, are in abeyance.</p><p>Davies, who has won 36 Wales caps, would be able to earn more elsewhere, but the summer showed him one of the advantages of being in Wales: while his Welsh Lions colleagues based in France and England were in action on the opening day of the season, he had an extra few weeks off. \"I had a really good break after Australia and I was really grateful for that,\" he said. \"I was able to get away and not think about rugby at all. I am back into it now and I hope my future can be sorted out quickly. I want to stay in Wales.</p><p>\"Being part of a successful Lions series was special, something that will stay with me for ever. It re-emphasised my desire for more success at club and international level and there was a feeling of excitement when I returned to training.</p><p>\"I love the ethos at the Scarlets and we are all excited about the start of the Heineken Cup, which is a special tournament. It is the best club tournament out there and Harlequins away first up is as tough as it gets. We won at Northampton a couple of years ago and, as we were then, we are a side that likes to move the ball and play open rugby.\"</p><p>Having lost George North to Northampton in the summer, the Scarlets are keen to hold on to their one remaining player who is a fixture in the Wales side and two other international squad members, the outside-half Rhys Priestland, who missed this year's Six Nations because of injury, and the centre Scott Williams, are also out of contract at the end of the season.</p><p>\"I feel for the regions,\" said Nigel Davies, the Gloucester director of rugby who moved to Kingsholm from the Scarlets last year.</p><p>\"Jonathan Davies has emerged as one of the best centres in the world and neither Wales nor the Scarlets will want to lose him. I think it is important that all those involved at the top end of the game in Wales stop arguing and start trying to find a solution.\"</p><p>Jonathan Davies, for the moment, is focusing on the two Heineken Cup rounds this month, which are a prelude to next month's four internationals in Cardiff when South Africa and Australia will be among the visitors. \"I had a relaxing few weeks, but now is the time to make sure my performances on the pitch reach the standard I have set myself,\" he said. \"We will all have to be at our best against Harlequins and I can't wait.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419100629|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|af8b7415505d626737b9afd539cb807d8e1b4aba -->",

        "headline":"Watch out for the Irish as Heineken Cup sets sail on the sunset tour",
        "body":"<p>It is not quite a trip on board the Titanic, more farewell cruises by an elegant liner and her sister ship before they are sent, with barely a spot of rust on their hulls, to the breaking yard. The Heineken Cup and the Amlin Challenge Cup are about to set sail. All aboard for the sunset tour.</p><p>There have been more rousing build-ups to the start of European competition. No doubt at some point down the line – if this is to be the end – the poignancy of it all will catch us, and we shall compile the lists of our most memorable games of the past 19 seasons. But as things stand the tingle is not quite what it was.</p><p>In Ravenhill they may well disagree. There could not be a more bloodcurdling way to launch a valedictory Heineken Cup than by pitching the most formidable of the breakers into the backyard of one of the four provinces of Ireland, all of whose very viability is threatened – so they are told by those that would shape a future without them – by their loss of contact with the English. Ulster against Leicester. On any day in any year it would have an appeal. On Friday it will be a rallying cry.</p><p>It may carry all the way to neighbouring Connacht, who will be simultaneously raising a roar for the visit of Saracens. Connacht sit in Pool Three, alongside the Zebre of Parma, double proof of some cosy Celtic-Italian accommodation, an alliance that strengthens the vote against Franco-English reformers, while at the same time diluting quality on the field and reducing income for the outnumbered parties. Such are the perceptions on the one side, although it may be prudent for Saracens in Galway to keep any support for such views to themselves, at least until after their 80 minutes are done.</p><p>In this season to end all seasons, it is tempting to draw the battle line between the Celts and Italians on one side and the French and the English on the other. It is not quite as simple as that. On Saturday evening the Ospreys and Leinster, the headline acts of Wales and Ireland in recent times, meet in Pool One. Relations between the regions of Wales and the Irish provinces have been tepid from the earliest days of the Celtic League. Wales have never been able to stifle their yearning to go east into England for their rugby, rather than west, north and south, the directions the RaboDirect Pro 12 takes them.</p><p>Warren Gatland, former coach of Ireland and current coach of Wales, was aware of a certain lack of Christmas-card exchange between his players even before he dropped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/05/brian-odriscoll-resents-warren-gatland\" title=\"\">Brian O'Driscoll</a> for the last Lions Test. There certainly won't be too much <em>Nadolig Llawen</em> on display in Dublin this December. It doesn't matter that there may be nothing personal between BOD, the deposed centre, and Alun Wyn Jones, the Lions captain in that last Test, but their meeting in Swansea symbolises a rivalry whose temperature continues to rise.</p><p>On the subject of the Ospreys, the manner in which they can purportedly rest their top players on Pro 12 days, saving them for Heineken Cup ties, causes the English and the French to rail against iniquity. If only life were so restful, Alun Wyn might say. For starters, the Ospreys find themselves in Pool One, with not only the champions of three of the past five years, but also Northampton and Castres.</p><p></p><p>The Ospreys will face Castres, the defending Top 14 champions, in rounds three and four in December – three weekends, that is, after the end of England's autumn international campaigns, and two after France's. Wales, having to compensate for coffers less full, build in an extra international weekend in November. This year they play Australia on the 30th.</p><p>The Ospreys meet Castres away in France six days later, on Friday 6th. The crow-barring of the extra international fixture into November helps explain why the Welsh regions fume at the Welsh Rugby Union, the governing body who leave them at a disadvantage in their most prestigious competition.</p><p>Glasgow and Edinburgh have expressed more alarm than anyone about the future of the professional game in Scotland should European Rugby Cup, the organisers of the Heineken and Amlin Challenge, be brought down and nothing put in its place. Or nothing to which they were invited. What would help the Scottish cause no end would be a run like Edinburgh's in 2012, all the way to the semi-final.</p><p>But they find themselves in tough pools. Edinburgh are alongside Munster, Gloucester and Perpignan, by tradition ferociously difficult to beat at home. Do Edinburgh count as indomitable at home at Murrayfield? Losing 22-9 to the Scarlets in front of 3,586 in the Pro 12 possibly didn't make their three Heineken opponents pause for thought.</p><p>Glasgow are in with the Cardiff Blues – whom at least they know exceedingly well – and Exeter, whom they don't. Finally there is Toulon, who only happen to be the defending Heineken Cup champions and have all sorts of ambitions to be the best side in Europe – or in France and England – for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Leicester, Northampton and Saracens are never going to be far away in any match, or any tussle at the top of their pools. Likewise, Toulouse and Toulon. But if any side will choose this season of the raised axe to make a defiant stand, it is probably going to be Irish. Leinster and Munster have history in Europe, and Ulster may be priming themselves at just the right moment. It will then be difficult to leave the Irish out of whatever comes next.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419085854|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|597abd943b547a4fb2e7ca3c52e3e25c7ea841d7 -->",

        "body":"<p>New Zealand won the battle and the war as they clinched the Rugby Championship thanks to a 38-27 win over South Africa in Johannesburg.</p><p>The All Blacks needed a single point to win the title and they duly obliged in the 61st minute when the replacement fly-half Beauden Barrett slipped his way through a porous Springbok defence to score the bonus-point try. Barrett's effort and subsequent conversion made the score 31-27 before No8 Kieran Read dotted down, three minutes later, to make sure of the victory.</p><p>The New Zealand captain, Richie McCaw, was deeply satisfied by his team's win at a venue where they had not tasted victory since 1997. \"We had to dig really deep. There was a hell of a lot of running, add the yellow cards and all the travel. It's very satisfying,\" he said.</p><p>The All Blacks managed the victory despite incurring two second-half yellow cards as they pounced on any South African mistake. \"We took our opportunities. There were times we were under serious pressure. We turned things around and capitalised on it,\" McCaw added after his team had lived off scraps for much of the first half.</p><p>The South Afric,a coach Heyneke Meyer, claimed his team lost the match because of poor defence. \"They didn't score from our mistakes as usual, they scored from poor defence. The boys are shattered. We really wanted to win this,\" said Meyer. \"We had to be really accurate defensively and we weren't. The defining moment was the missed Kieran Read tackle towards the end.\"</p><p>South Africa drew early blood through a penalty from fly-half Morne Steyn, but the Springboks' inability to collect restarts cost them when New Zealand regathered the kick-off and a deft offload from Read set Ben Smith off on a mazy run, the full-back beating three men on his way to the try line. The score seemed to invigorate the home team and they abandoned their usual subdue-and-penetrate game plan in favour of a more high-tempo, ball-in-hand approach.</p><p>Springbok left wing Bryan Habana grabbed two tries in as many minutes as the Springboks found space on the outside. The first of Habana's tries was set up by a line break from No8 Duane Vermeulen, but he demonstrated individual brilliance in scoring his second, regathering his own chip ahead on his way to his 17th try in the Rugby Championship/Tri-Nations.</p><p>Habana limped off in the 22nd minute with a hamstring injury before the All Blacks slowly worked their way back into the contest. Fourteen minutes before the break New Zealand flank Liam Messam was driven over from close range. With time having already lapsed in the first half the Springboks allowed a turnover, which led to Messam crossing in the left-hand corner and New Zealand reached half-time holding a 21-15 lead.</p><p>Messam was shown a yellow card six minutes after the restart and South Africa grabbed their third try, through the wing Willie le Roux, from the resulting penalty. They scored a bonus point of their own in the 58th minute, when outside centre Jean de Villiers scored an unconverted try.</p><p>But the partisan crowd were to be disappointed as Barrett scored the decisive try despite the replacement prop Owen Franks receiving a 62nd-minute penalty for punching.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419146589|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|1ba6389c42d2e9126996b2db106eee4a1f21275f -->",

        "headline":"Northampton let winning lead slip against Leicester but make a point",
        "body":"<p>Northampton may have blown a 10-point lead in as many minutes at the end of a typically intense east Midlands derby, but no longer are they noticeably stronger physically than they are mentally and, with Saracens, are some way ahead of the rest after the opening month of the season.</p><p>Seldom can the Leicester faithful have received a draw with such rapture, although the Tigers blew the chance to plunder an unmerited victory with the last play of the game when an attacking scrum – which looked as if it would result in yet another penalty for them – ended with the ball squirting out and Northampton seizing it.</p><p>Leicester were stronger in the set pieces, the scrum especially, but that phase of the game is in danger of going the way of the four-point drop goal. There were eight resets and nine penalties/free-kicks, while only four scrums yielded possession. Yellow cards are not being used as a deterrent, with sides still prepared to do anything other than concede prime possession to opponents.</p><p>Northampton, light in terms of pushing in the second row, struggled in the scrum all afternoon and had two fewer options in the lineout than Leicester. But the modern game is far more about the breakdown than the set pieces and the Saints so dominated that area that it took&nbsp;the Tigers an hour to establish an attacking foothold.</p><p>It was only when the centre Luther Burrell and the second row Courtney Lawes went off, 10 minutes from the end – the former with a sore shoulder and the latter to the sin bin for breaking too many laws – that Leicester started getting over the gain line. Northampton, in contrast, had made dents in the home defence throughout, their try on 46 minutes the result of a series of drives that started on the home 10-metre line.</p><p>The Northampton No8, Sam Dickinson, has been one of the discoveries of the season, a typhoon who plays with savage power. He may find himself having to account for his first action of the game, a high tackle on Blaine Scully that left the Leicester wing with a sore jaw and a visit to the concussion bin, but the former Rotherham forward is the ideal accompaniment to the likes of Lawes, Samu Manoa, Burrell and Dylan Hartley, immovable objects bent on destruction.</p><p>There was a period in the final quarter when Leicester, trailing by seven points and fortunate to still be in the match, mounted a sustained attack for the first time in the game, but the closer they got to the line, they less they looked like crossing it. The defensive pressure exerted by Northampton forced handling errors, with even forwards Jordan Crane and Ed Slater cracking, but the most egregious mistake was made by the large form of Vereniki Goneva, who – confronted by the form of Burrell – got rid of the ball with such haste that it went metres forward.</p><p>Northampton had lost their previous eight matches against Leicester – including last May's Premiership final, when they played the second half without their captain, Hartley, who had been sent off for crudely questioning the integrity of the referee – and in many of them they had been bullied. Not this time.</p><p>Afterwards, the Leicester assistant coach Paul Burke said his side, missing five leading players, would get better and asked whether Northampton, operating at full strength, would. But the germane point about the Saints is that, after years of failing to get a result away to their top-four rivals – 21 consecutive games without a victory – they have won at Saracens and Harlequins, and drawn here.</p><p>They have grown up and if Stephen Myler's three penalties – to two from Toby Flood – looked a meagre return for their first-half dominance, the wearing-down process was given its reward by Alex Corbisiero's try. Such was their confidence that Northampton turned down a kickable penalty 10 minutes in, after Burrell's tackle on Anthony Allen forced a turnover.</p><p>The driving maul may have gone nowhere, but Northampton made a psychological point and Leicester were inhibited until the departures of Burrell and Lawes, missing the physical thrust of Manu Tuilagi, but, more than that, lacking direction and in need of a strategist at forward. They played a second row, Ed Slater, in the back row, which cost them three early points when he was slow getting up from a scrum and missed a tackle on Dickinson.</p><p>Flood missed two penalties, which also looked like being costly with 10 minutes to go. Then Lawes was sent to the sin bin – Northampton's seventh yellow card this season, with Burrell given 10 minutes off in the first half for a tip tackle on Allen – along with his opposite number Louis Deacon, who gave the referee unsolicited advice.</p><p>Flood kicked the Lawes penalty, which was not reversed as Northampton felt it should have been, and then came a final assault. Flood was tackled by Manoa just short of the line, but, for once, Leicester got the ball away smartly and Slater scored to give his side an uneven draw.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419147812|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|97e74753433475911dd39bfb4e572d2ad6e93f1a -->",

        "body":"<p>Harlequins continued their disappointing start to the season by going down to their third Aviva Premiership defeat in five starts as they lost 18-13 to London Irish.</p><p>For the first 60 minutes, Quins were marginally the better side but a huge tackling effort from Irish prevented them from developing their customary free-flowing game as the visitors too often gave the ball away. In addition there were three penalty misses from the Quins which cost them dear.</p><p>The game turned on its head as Irish scored two tries in quick succession through Blair Cowan and Alex Lewington and despite a solo effort from Danny Care, the Irish were able to hang on for a morale-boosting victory.</p><p>The London Irish captain, George Skivington, returned after injury to make his first appearance of the season while John Yapp was given a first start at prop. Number eight Chris Hala'ufia was a late withdrawal with a knee injury to be replaced by Ian Gough, with Kieran Low switching to the back row.</p><p>For Harlequins, Karl Dickson was at scrum-half with Simon Smith and Matt Hopper being introduced into the three-quarter line in place of Tom Williams and the injured George Lowe.</p><p>Irish suffered an early blow when they lost Lowe with a shoulder injury after only two minutes but they received an immediate boost by taking the lead. Karl Dickson was penalised for illegal use of the boot at a ruck, allowing Shane Geraghty to kick the resulting penalty.</p><p>Harlequins had the better of the opening quarter but it was 3-3 at the end of it with Nick Evans kicking a penalty after earlier missing a more straightforward one.</p><p>The first half hour was littered with errors as neither side could take advantage of the ideal playing conditions as the game was devoid of excitement. There was one 40-metre burst from Maurie Fa'asavalu which enlivened proceedings but that move fizzled out as Quins made another handling mistake.</p><p>The visitors received two quick setbacks. First they lost the centre Tom Casson with an injury before moments later Geraghty put Irish back in front with his second penalty.</p><p>Evans responded with one for the Quins to tie up the scores at half-time but the Irish should have been ahead. Three minutes before the interval, the home side were awarded a penalty straight in front of the posts 20 metres out but Geraghty opted to take a quick tap which brought no reward.</p><p>With 30 minutes remaining, Quins brought on Care at scrum-half in place of Dickson and he should have seen his side take the lead but Evans missed with an eminently kickable penalty.</p><p>Quins made a further change as Chris Robshaw departed to be replaced by Luke Wallace and they had another chance to go ahead. This time the replacement Ben Botica was given the kicking duties but his attempt from the halfway line went narrowly wide.</p><p>The visitors were made to pay for those kicking lapses as Irish scored two tries in three minutes to dramatically change the course of the game. The home pack were becoming more influential which resulted in Cowan driving over from close range for his first try for the club, with Geraghty adding the conversion.</p><p>Quins sought to respond but again they lost possession. Topsy Ojo capitalised with a delightfully judged kick which enabled Lewington to gather and skilfully evade Botica for the crucial try.</p><p>Quins fought back with a try of their own, Care skipping away from a ruck to run 25 metres to score and Evans converted, to set up a grandstand finish but the Irish just held on.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419146655|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|a18d4bc9838331f7b8c5c8f0bcc263eaf32e2b49 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>You only play in the front row</strong> if you're prepared to be confrontational. You also can't be a loner – you're relying on the two guys next to you for your safety, because people can get badly hurt in the scrum.</p><p><strong>A lot of the maxims that are good for sport do not help you in life.</strong> For instance: \"Never give up, never quit…\"</p><p><strong>I'm adopted, so I'm not like my parents.</strong> But I keep aspiring to their values, of tolerance, of quiet dignity, of work ethic, of decency.</p><p><strong>Sport is very simple: you win or you lose.</strong> There's a comfort in that. But nothing is ever like that again. It's come as a bit of a shock to me: life is not black and white and if you try to live it like that you're going to be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Being a lawyer teaches you to argue rationally.</strong> [Moore is a trained solicitor.] It drives me crazy when people argue with non-sequiturs.</p><p><strong>Someone will always be richer than you,</strong> someone will be better looking. I'm trying to learn to value my achievements, but my head is always saying the next one is the only one that matters. I can't control my competitive streak.</p><p><strong>I'm actually quite an angry man.</strong> The thing that makes me angry at the moment it is people not answering questions. Politicians, local authorities, people from quangos… There's a whole industry teaching people not to answer things, not to tell the truth.</p><p><strong>There's a tendency in this country</strong> for people to be vicariously offended. Get over it: if you're offended by something, stop thinking and reading about it.</p><p><strong>The Lions tour is special</strong> in a way that people who haven't been round it can't really understand. The players who are there are all used to being number one in their country, they're not used to fighting for a place continually.</p><p><strong>You can't buy anything in life that's really important,</strong> and you can't force it either. People's affection, people's friendship – they're not commodities.</p><p><strong>The best I've ever felt on a rugby field</strong> was when David Campese dropped the ball behind his line in the third Test of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOCN4dkyvp4\" title=\"\">Lions series in 1989</a> to make us the first and only Lions side to lose the first Test in a series and still win. That was a very pleasing moment, especially because it was David.</p><p><strong>If I've ever been truly happy </strong>it's been in those fleeting moments you can't manufacture, like this one day we were on the beach in Cornwall and the children designed a sphinx out of sand.</p><p><strong>When I </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianmoore666\" title=\"\"><strong>tweet</strong></a><strong> about opera,</strong> people say: \"Oh, trying to show off are we?\" I say no, it's all culture, it's just that my culture's different to yours. Give me the <em>Magic Flute</em> and a bottle of 1982 Saint-Émilion.</p><p><strong>I had a great wedding day.</strong> Well, I had a few. I'm on my third one, and they were all great.</p><p><br /><em>Brian Moore is part of talkSPORT's commentary team for the British and Irish Lions Tour to Australia on 1089/1053am and DAB (</em><a href=\"http://www.talksport.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>talkSPORT.co.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/410093083|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|58eb859d4ee6ea93b49d26c4aab7d8f3438d9d9c -->",

        "headline":"Jonny Wilkinson kicks Toulon to Heineken Cup final win over Clermont",
        "body":"<p>On the day of reckoning, an all-French final, the side that had not lost a single game in the Heineken Cup did just that, failing against Jonny Wilkinson's Toulon. Clermont will be wondering how on earth they let slip a game they seized by the scruff after half-time. Mathieu Bastareaud, who tackled his way to the man of the match award, will not care a jot how his team scrambled to victory. For the record, two Englishmen scored the points that mattered: Wilkinson 11 from three penalties and a conversion, and Delon Armitage with a try.</p><p>For the first 15 minutes there was thunder on the ground, a man-made alternative to any storm in the skies. Rain that had been forecast but wisely kept its distance. The tacklers advanced furiously and the ball-carriers were swept back. The body has become the new object in the game that can be picked up and tossed around. During this period of Rollerball, the two little figures of Wilkinson and Mogan Parra remained sufficiently intact to land a penalty each</p><p>Mercifully for the shoulders of the Toulon captain, the game sprang the locks on its shackles even before the first quarter was out. He had to make a tackle less juddering than the head-on variety when he raced back to stop Wesley Fofana, the centre who was on full alert now that there was a little bit less suffocation. Clermont had others now hungry for the ball. Sitiveni Sivivatu roamed away from the touchline and was slipped a pass that put him into a postage stamp of space. The ex-All Black was stopped only by a tackle of athletic agility by Andrew Sheridan, the prop propelling himself horizontally at the wing.</p><p>Lee Byrne brought a different kind of threat from full-back, chasing and gathering his own kick, a glimpse of his speciality in the Wales grand slam campaign of 2005.</p><p>That was how the openness expressed itself, in snatches, flashes, echoes of days of greater freedom. But nothing lasted; no runner could run clear of the scrambling tacklers.</p><p>Not until Rudi Wulf spilt the ball near the touchline on halfway and Clermont pounced, releasing Brock James. The Australian is not the quickest in the universe but he found himself in a race, in pursuit of his own kick ahead, with Chris Masoe, more hulk than whippet. James beat the No8 but not the dead-ball line. Video review led to a 22 drop-out and the game turned around at half-time still at 3-3.</p><p>The deadlock lasted 90 seconds into the second half. Again, Clermont swooped when they had a whiff of space but this time Toulon could not plug the gap opened up by Aurélien Rougerie in particular, the centre pulling in two defenders before releasing the ball to Napolioni Nalaga, the leading try-scorer in the Heineken Cup this season. It was another straight race, Clermont player against a last defender and a line – the touchline this time. Nalaga won.</p><p>Toulon needed to score quickly as if to give themselves a point of restart in this second half. Wilkinson obliged after a maul was hauled down. Toulon were back, but only until the combination of James and Rougerie struck again. More time passed than 90 seconds but not much when James dinked a little kick over the Toulon three-quarters and Rougerie barged past Wilkinson to regather and slip another fine pass to James. Now there was nobody between the outside-half and the line. Parra added the conversion.</p><p>Toulon rang the changes, taking off Danie Rossouw, who had had a clumsy game, and replacing one ex-Springbok with another, Joe van Niekerk. The 38-year-old Sébastien Bruno left too, the old – Toulon are not exactly in their first flush – giving way to the less venerable. The most influential change was to be Frédéric Michalak, on at scrum-half, and kicking into space to give his team something to pursue in a positive direction. James, retreating, gave away a penalty and Wilkinson reduced the gap to six points.</p><p>Clermont still seemed to be more comfortable with the ball in hand, but Toulon took a leaf from that opening chapter, when to have a body in hand was the name of the game. Fofana set off on a run but was brought down by Bakkies Botha and Van Niekerk. Sivivatu fumbled the pick-up and was stripped by Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe.</p><p>The Argentine wing-forward delivered a one-handed pass to Armitage who strolled over for Toulon's first try in the knock-out stages. Wilkinson converted, not the most difficult kick of his career, but at the end of his penultimate season, for a club that has revitalised his extraordinary career, this mattered.</p><p>He delivered and, remarkably, Toulon were in the lead by a point with 16 minutes left to play.</p><p>They held on, Bastareaud charging down a drop-goal attempt by James, and Sivivatu throwing the last, the very last, try-scoring pass forward. Jonny Wilkinson, king of the elder statesman, had his hands on the Heineken Cup</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/409110418|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|9024b9a1e9f0992643417a140b6b8aaf1984163c -->",

        "headline":"Prince Harry to lead push to expand rugby into inner-city schools",
        "body":"<p>It takes its name from a famous private school and, for some, has long been associated with the Barbour-wearing, Range Rover-driving masses that throng Twickenham whenever England play.</p><p>As part of an effort to change that image the Rugby Football Union (RFU) has launched a new drive to get hundreds more state schools, many of them in inner cities, playing the game to make the most of a hoped-for boom in its profile around the 2015 Rugby World Cup, which will be staged in England.</p><p>Apparently without irony, the Old Etonian Prince Harry has been named as the <a href=\"http://www.rfu.com/news/2013/march/news-articles/070313_all_schools_patron\" title=\"\">patron for the All Schools scheme</a>, with the aim of getting 400 more state schools playing the game by 2015 and 750 more playing by 2019.</p><p>Clusters of three or four schools will be targeted and provided with kit, equipment and resources by the RFU as well as being linked with a local club, which will also provide coaching and ongoing support.</p><p>Steve Grainger, RFU rugby development director, said the programme was aimed both at schools that used to play the game but had dropped the habit and those that had never taken it up, seeking to provide coaching education for teachers who had never played or taught the game.</p><p>\"One of our aims up to 2015 and beyond is to broaden the reach of the game and ensure it is a game that can be played by everyone. It can have a real impact on a school not only from a sporting perspective, but from a behaviour perspective, a values perspective, a discipline perspective,\" he said.</p><p>The RFU estimates that of a total of just over 3,000 secondary schools, about half of them play some form of rugby and about 750 of those play competitive fixtures against other schools.</p><p>Grainger, who was previously chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, acknowledged that the government's decision to axe £162m in ringfenced funding for a network of school sport partnerships had made the task more difficult but said rugby benefited from a network of willing clubs and volunteers.</p><p>\"We're talking about a three-year investment from us to sustain rugby in these schools. We're not only looking for willing schools, we're looking for willing clubs that have got some capacity and a commitment to work with schools,\" said Grainger.</p><p>In developing links between clubs and schools, the hope is that children can graduate to clubs and help to arrest a decline in the number of teenagers playing competitive rugby, despite a boom in younger children playing \"mini rugby\". Grainger said that many of those chosen would be \"inner-city schools\" in some \"pretty tough environments\".</p><p>\"This is a great way to bring in some new players, some new parents, some new volunteers and new coaches through those teenage years and demonstrating that rugby has as much, if not more, to offer than many other sports.\"</p><p>Those without facilities will be provided with rugby posts or linked with clubs where they can play and the benefits of touch rugby and sevens will also be emphasised for those who may not be suited to the full-contact sport.</p><p>Grainger said: \"There is a perception still that it is an independent school sport. But if you look at the 23 players in the matchday squad against France and take out the three that were educated overseas, 13 of those guys came from the state sector.\"</p><p>The initiative is part of a wider drive to bring rugby union to parts of the country where it is traditionally less popular, ahead of the 2015 World Cup, which will be staged largely in big Premier League football grounds around England.</p><p>The final list of venues will be confirmed on Friday but Old Trafford in Manchester, Elland Road in Leeds, Newcastle's St James' Park and St Mary's in Southampton are among those on the long list.</p><p>\"I don't think there's a perception that it's a poor relation to football, but it just doesn't get the same degree of exposure. One of the things we're finding is that local rugby clubs tend to have an identity in the community that football clubs don't. We're trying to position them at the heart of their local community,\" said Grainger.</p><p>There is an acknowledgement that the RFU failed to capitalise on a surge in popularity for the sport when Sir Clive Woodward led England to the 2003 World Cup and is determined not to repeat the mistakes of that era.</p><p>Before Sunday's Six Nations tie against Italy at Twickenham, which England are expected to win to set up the possibility of a grand slam decider against Wales at the Millennium Stadium, 100 participating state schools will be presented with a rugby shirt made to their own design as part of a programme to learn about the \"core values of rugby\".</p><p>A St James's Palace spokesperson said: \"This patronage will allow Prince Harry to combine his passion for rugby with his work to help children and young people in society to build their skills, confidence and aspirations. Prince Harry recognises that rugby can play an important role in helping to achieve this.\"</p><p>Grainger insisted there was no irony in the appointment of Prince Harry, a regular visitor to Twickenham, as patron: \"This is about adding genuine weight and genuine profile, and hopefully other people getting the opportunities that he had.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/405260609|2013-10-07T10:05:55Z|9c8fff81a2d6d2c63faef285f8a163154e45ea5a -->",
