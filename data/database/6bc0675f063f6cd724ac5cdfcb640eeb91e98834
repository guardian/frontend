        "body":"<p>The company behind the wireless Beats headphones and Nike Running gadget has unveiled the world's thinnest keyboard, with a flexible, wireless touchscreen just half a millimetre thick.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.csr.com/\" title=\"\">Cambridge-based CSR</a>, which specialises in wireless technology, showcased a prototype of the product at the IFA consumer electronics event in Berlin, but it will be 12 months before it will be available to buy.</p><p>Paul Williamson, CSR's director of low power wireless products, said the final form factor depended on how manufacturers bring the keyboard to market, although its primary use is likely to be as a lightweight, complementary external keyboard for tablet devices. \"This is a working prototype and a glimpse forward rather than something people will be buying this year,\" he said.</p><p>\"We might see lots of shapes and sizes, some as small as iPad Mini or a larger, more rigid form for a desktop PC, which could be curved, in any colour way, transparent or fitted with a leather folio.\"</p><p>Developed in partnership with Cambridge Inkjet Technology, the interface for the product is printed out and can be customised. That could mean printing bespoke keyboards in different languages with ease, or customised keyboards for functions such as video editing and for customers who would like personalised patterns or messages on their own keyboard.</p><p>The keyboard's touchscreen could also be used under a piece of paper to transcribe notes made with a pen and sync them to a computer.</p><p>CSR's research has led to wireless products that enable music streaming in the popular Beats headphones, the performance-tracking tool the Nike+ SportWatch and the Jambox speaker.</p><p>Founded in 1999, CSR is one of a cluster of successful, research-focused tech companies clustered around Cambridge and \"Silicon Fen\" who have recently discussed introducing a \"Made in Cambridge\" badge to promote their products.</p><p>\"The audio experience you're getting from Beats headphones exists because we developed it, put it out there and now it is used on a global scale,\" said Williamson.</p><p>\"People don't recognise that that kind of innovation is developed by a small number of very bright people here, and the pool of engineering talent and expertise here deserves a bit more credit than the app economy drive in the periphery of London.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416363126|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|970222c35a19b9989ef138a977b2e90b4de66640 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"The wrist is interesting,\" <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2013/05/29/apples-tim-cook-points-to-dearth-of-multiple-use-wrist-gadgets/\">said Apple chief executive Tim Cook</a> at the All Things Digital D11 conference in May 2013, when being quizzed about his company's potential plans for wearable technology in the years to come.</p><p>\"For something to work here you have to convince people it's so incredible, that they want to wear it... If we had a room full of 10 to 20-year-olds and we said, 'Everyone stand up that has a watch,' I'm not sure anybody would stand up.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Apple is one of the technology giants at the centre of growing speculation about smartwatches. Along with Samsung – whose Galaxy Gear is expected to be unveiled later this week – Google and Microsoft, the wrist is proving interesting for anyone who's anyone in the smartphone world.</p><p>Research firm Canalys recently claimed that 500,000 smartwatches will be sold this year, but then 5m in 2014 thanks to the entry of Apple, Samsung, Google and other technology firms into the market, alongside traditional watch-makers. </p><p>Rival IDC even thinks that <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24291713\">demand for wearables (including watches) could slow down tablet sales</a> over the coming years, reducing its forecasts accordingly. So what do we know – or, to be more accurate, what's been rumoured – about the plans of the big tech firms?</p><h2>Apple</h2><p>Apple has been rumoured to be making a smartwatch for some time now – it's a perennial rumour alongside an Apple television, hence those questions for Cook. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/01/apple-register-iwatch-trademark\">Apple's registration of iWatch as a trademark</a> in Japan in June this year only fanned the flames of that speculation.</p><p>That came after a New York Times report claiming that the company had been <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/disruptions-apple-is-said-to-be-developing-a-curved-glass-smart-watch/?smid=tw-share\">\"experimenting with wristwatch-like devices made of curved glass\"</a> and running  iOS software.</p><p>Past employees have been speculating too: <a href=\"http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/\">interface expert Bruce Tognazzini claimed the \"iWatch\" would</a> \"fill a gaping hole in the Apple ecosystem. It will facilitate and coordinate not only the activities of all the other computers and devices we use, but a wide array of devices to come\".</p><p>Fellow ex-Appler <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/mar/11/apple-iwatch-technology-monday-note\">Jean-Louis Gassée provided his own opinions back in March</a>, suggesting that \"the iWatch will enrich the iOS ecosystem: Reasonably useful on its own, but most important as a way to increase the value/enjoyment of other iDevices… at least for now.\"</p><p>In July, reports suggested that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/15/apple-iwatch-hiring-outside-expertise\">Apple had made a number of \"acqui-hires\" of small companies</a> to build its \"iWatch\" team, sitting within a wider wearables group at the company. The Financial Times claimed that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a3cbfce-ec0f-11e2-bfdb-00144feabdc0.html\">Apple had been forced to turn to outsiders</a> to help with \"hard engineering problems that they've not been able to solve\" in-house.</p><p>In August, reports in Taiwan claimed that two local companies, Quanta and Inventec, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/29/apple-iwatch-suppliers-samsung\">won the contracts to build Apple's first smartwatch</a>, with suggestions that they could build up to 38m units in 2014 – although CIMB Securities analyst Wanli Wang predicted 63m units shipping in the first year after the device launched.</p><h2>Samsung</h2><p>Plenty of details have leaked out about Samsung's smartwatch plans: it's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/16/samsung-apple-smartwatch-galaxy-gear-release\">expected to be called the Galaxy Gear</a>, and will be unveiled on 4 September ahead of the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin.</p><p>Last weekend, VentureBeat claimed a scoop: <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/01/this-is-samsungs-galaxy-gear-smartwatch-a-blocky-health-tracker-with-a-camera/\">actual pictures of the Galaxy Gear</a>, although the description – \"a blocky health tracker with a camera\" – didn't exactly whet the appetite.</p><p>The emphasis was firmly on fitness though: \"My initial impression was that it's a new wearable fitness device to rival a Nike Fuelband or Fitbit Flex — a smartphone companion rather than a smartphone alternative,\" wrote journalist Christina Farr. Separately, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/373185266720055296/photo/1\">shots of Samsung's app for controlling the watch</a> have also leaked, via the @evleaks Twitter account.</p><p>The expectation: a device designed as a companion to Samsung's Galaxy range of Android smartphones. As with other companies mentioned here, the inspiration is thought to be as much fitness-tracking bands by the likes of Jawbone, Nike and Fitbit rather than trying to squeeze a smartphone's guts into a watch-shaped device.</p><h2>Google</h2><p>It's just emerged that <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/08/30/google-wimm-labs-smartwatch-acquisition/\">Google quietly bought a smartwatch startup called Wimm Labs</a> in 2012: the company had released its own <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/9/2546990/wimm-one-review\">WIMM One</a> smartwatch in 2011 before shutting down in 2012 due to \"an exclusive, confidential relationship for our technology\". Google.</p><p>WIMM had been trying to build a platform for developers rather than just a device, although within Google it's now part of an even bigger platform and developer community: Android. Yet the other interesting thing about the WIMM One was its ability to work as a standalone gadget with its own apps, rather than simply controlling apps on a paired smartphone.</p><p>News of the acquisition made previous Google smartwatch rumours worth a second reading. The Financial Times reported in March, for example, that <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2013/03/google-smart-watch/?\">Google was working on a smartwatch project</a> within its Android unit, and cited a <a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm&amp;r=23&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=(20121002.PD.%20AND%20Google.ASNM.)&amp;OS=ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google&amp;RS=(ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google)\">patent application by the company from 2011</a> for a \"smart-watch\" including a \"tactile user interface\".</p><p>The Wall Street Journal followed that up in June with claims that<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323689204578571992848684764-lMyQjAxMTAzMDIwNzEyNDcyWj.html\"> a smartwatch was being developed alongside a games console</a>, both powered by Android, as Google moved more into hardware. There was a hint that the two devices may be in competition in terms of securing a commercial release: \"The Internet giant hopes to design and market the devices itself and release at least one of them this fall,\" as journalist Amir Efrati put it.</p><h2>Microsoft</h2><p>Microsoft and smartwatches? There's some history behind that: the company's SPOT platform tempted the likes of Fossil, Suunto, Swatch and Tissot when its first watches launched in 2004, but <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/23/spot-watches-r-i-p-2004-2008/\">by 2008 it was toast</a>, filed alongside Tablet PC in the company's possibly-too-soon filing cabinet.</p><p>And in 2013? Suppliers to Microsoft <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324485004578423522275087936.html\">told the Wall Street Journal in April</a> that the company was sourcing components for a smartwatch prototype, including 1.5-inch displays. </p><p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/15/4524286/microsoft-surface-watch-smartwatch-testing-rumors\">The Verge followed up</a>, suggesting that devices were now being prototyped \"directly under the Surface team as the firm moves its wrist-worn device closer to reality\". The trouble with all Microsoft rumours right now, however, is that with chief executive Steve Ballmer on the way out, it's unclear what his replacement's strategy will be regarding schemes at the prototype stage.</p><h2>And the rest?</h2><p>Pebble Technology has sold more than 85,000 of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/21/pebble-smart-watch-kickstarter\">Pebble watches</a> since raising $10.3m to make them on Kickstarter. Sony is already on its second device, the SmartWatch 2, which went on sale earlier this year.</p><p>High-end smartwatch <a href=\"http://smartwatch.fm/blog/2013/8/30/exclusive-hyetis-crossbow-already-has-sold-300-smartwatches-at-1200-a-pop\">the Hyetis Crossbow has sold more than 300 units</a> – and that's at $1,200 per device. Intel is also testing some smartwatch devices in its labs.</p><p>\"The watch is kind of — if you want to put the time on it, that's fine,\" <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/17/smartwatch-intel/\">chief technology officer Justin Rattner told a Bloomberg conference</a> in June 2013. \"But if you're talking about texting today, wouldn't it be nice if you could just look at your wrist?\"</p><p>\"Almost every major consumer electronics manufacturer is now working on a smartwatch\" <a href=\"http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/\">noted Quartz in July 2013</a>. And that's not to mention the traditional watch manufacturers.</p><p>\"Suddenly, everyone's discovered the wrist,\" Casio's chief executive Kazuo Kashio <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/technology/in-advent-of-the-smartwatch-a-name-thats-been-there-before.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times in August</a>. \"We've known for a long time it's prime real estate. We're prepared.\"</p><h2>What does this all mean?</h2><p>How much of the excitement about smartwatches is due to the desire within the technology industry (yes, including journalists) for a new category-shaking range of devices, rather than actual demand from buyers or a strong sense of why these smartwatches would be useful?</p><p>\"Smartwatches are a great idea – except for the 'smart' and 'watch' parts,\" <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2013/06/25/smartwatches-are-a-great-idea-except-for-the-smart-and-watch-parts/\">noted Time's Harry McCracken in June</a>. He went on to outline the barriers: battery life, display quality and \"no true killer apps\" – although he admitted that fitness-tracking gadgets may offer the most interesting path forward.</p><p>Even so, the interest in the future of the wrist – from Tim Cook and his fiercest rivals' companies – is genuine, as are the questions around the category's future.</p><p>Will these devices be more wrist-worn controllers for smartphones (and other devices) than running their own apps? Will they kill off the fitness-tracking bands, or provide the companies making those like Jawbone, Fitbit and Nike with a new product category to move into? Those questions won't be answered until 2014 at the earliest, whenever the Galaxy Gear goes on sale.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416339563|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|9ee4687c1168b272432e33bf5ed356d2d03b7691 -->",

        "headline":"20 best iPhone and iPad apps this week",
        "body":"<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad devices.</p><p>It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. There's a separate roundup for Android apps, which was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/sep/02/best-android-apps-digg-simon-the-sorcerer\">published earlier in the day</a>.</p><p>For now, read on for this week's iOS selection (and when you've finished, check out previous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/best-iphone-and-ipad-apps\">Best iPhone and iPad apps</a> posts).</p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/parallels-access/id655527928?mt=8\">Parallels Access (Free)</a></h2><p>Parallels' new iPad app provides remote access to your desktop computer, whether it's a PC or Mac. The idea being you can fire up your desktop applications, control them via the touchscreen, and work with iPad apps – copying and pasting text for example. While it's free to download, it does need a year's subscription for £54.99 per computer once the 14-day trial runs out.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/explore-shakespeare/id608993627?mt=8\">Explore Shakespeare (Free)</a></h2><p>Shakespeare goes freemium! Although thankfully not in the 'in-app purchases to unlock dragons in Hamlet' sense. This is an app to access Cambridge University Press' individual versions of plays including Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Dream, with lots of innovative AND useful features to dig deeper into the texts. Each play costs £9.99.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-mindstorms-robot-commander/id681786521?mt=8\">Lego Mindstorms Robot Commander (Free)</a></h2><p>Lego has actually released three apps for its new Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit this week. Robot Commander is the one you use to control the five robots that can be built using the kit: walking, slithering, grasping, and then making you a cup of tea (I'm guessing with that last one: don't be disappointed). Also worth checking out: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-mindstorms-3d-builder/id679003776?mt=8\">Lego Mindstorms 3D Builder</a>, which teaches you how to build the bots, and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-mindstorms-fix-factory/id671493323?mt=8\">Lego Mindstorms Fix the Factory</a>, a puzzle game introducing one of them.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/madden-nfl-25-by-ea-sports/id657626045?mt=8\">Madden NFL 25 (Free)</a></h2><p>EA's moves to make some of its biggest game franchises freemium continues with Madden NFL the latest to get the treatment. Yes, there's American Football action here, but the focus is just as much on building a team of players through (digital) card-collecting, with in-app purchases funding your roster ambitions.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/material-blogs-news-rss-tailored/id673115871?mt=8\">Material (Free)</a></h2><p>The latest company aiming to provide a sleek news-aggregation app is INQ, with this port of the Material app that's been going down well on Android. Promising \"fresh new content you'll love based on what you already like\", it gets you to sign in with Twitter or Facebook, then analyses your posts to figure out what you might want to read about.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/monster-match-puzzle-adventure/id618279488?mt=8\">Monster Match (Free)</a></h2><p>Monster Match got me hooked on holiday last week with its combination of match-three puzzling and Pokemon-style monster-collecting. It sees you finding and battling more than 225 beasties by matching gems, with plenty of nuances in balancing the various abilities and levelling up. The inspiration is fairly clear: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/may/14/puzzle-and-dragons-gungho-revenues\">Puzzle &amp; Dragons</a>, currently one of the most lucrative mobile games in the world. But you can't yet play that here in the UK, so Monster Match is worth a look.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bittorrent-sync/id665156116?mt=8\">BitTorrent Sync (Free)</a></h2><p>No, not an actual BitTorrent filesharing client – Apple still doesn't allow those on the App Store. This is from BitTorrent the company – a file-syncing application tying into the wider BitTorrent Sync service, so you can access your folders and files on the go, and send photos and videos to those folders as well.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fleep/id678917069?mt=8\">Fleep (Free)</a></h2><p>As explained last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/aug/29/fleep-email-messaging-app\">Fleep is the new thing from two of Skype's founding engineers</a>: an app that sits somewhere between chat and email. It supports one-to-one and group chats, saving important messages to a Pinboard, and making shared photos and documents easily accessible.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quip/id647922896?mt=8\">Quip (Free)</a></h2><p>Quip is a much-talked-about new word processing app that – from this week – is available in the UK as well as the US. The schtick: it groups documents and messages about them in a chat-like \"thread of updates\", making collaboration clearer. It works across Android, iOS and desktop computers too.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flick-kick-field-goal-2014/id646568481?mt=8\">Flick Kick Field Goal 2014 (Free)</a></h2><p>I've had to uninstall the Flick Kick Football game several times after it got in the way of work, and developer PikPok has a good record with making other sports just as addictive too. This new Flick Kick Field Goal game focuses on American Football kicking, as you flick your balls (so to speak) to get as high a score as possible.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/inplayrs/id692721833?mt=8\">Inplayrs (Free)</a></h2><p>Inplayrs is worth keeping an eye on for sports fans: an app that gets you to compete with other players to predict outcomes as matches play, with live odds and data fed in all the time. It's the work of a team of ex Betfair, Morgan Stanley and Amazon folk, with sports covered including football, tennis, basketball and cricket.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/syllable/id687795555?mt=8\">Syllable (£0.69)</a></h2><p>Here's an interesting idea: an app that promises to help you \"earn to read much faster, and helps you finish your Instapaper and Pocket articles you've been meaning to get to\". So it ties into those services, while teaching you how to minimise \"subvocalisation\" (the process of saying – in your head – the words you read), thus speeding you up. Intriguing.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixaki-pixel-art-for-professionals/id689084217?mt=8\">Pixaki: Pixel Art for Professionals (£4.99)</a></h2><p>Pixel art – as seen in around 52% of critically-acclaimed iOS games in recent memory (rough estimate) – continues to be popular with game designers. What if you're doing it yourself, though? Pixaki aims to help you create \"anything from retro game characters to vast isometric cityscapes\" with intuitive touchscreen controls and clever upscaling tech for usage elsewhere.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tablepouncer-last-minute-dining/id689979016?mt=8\">TablePouncer (Free)</a></h2><p>Looking to bag a cheap meal at a decent restaurant? TablePouncer is aiming to satisfy your appetite for bargain grub. It rounds up deals for more than 500 restaurants in a selection of British cities including London, Brighton, Southampton, Bournemouth, Bristol and Bath (presumably it'll head north of the Watford Gap soon too, or at least you'd hope so).<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lucy-ladybird/id690850257?mt=8\">Lucy Ladybird (£3.99)</a></h2><p>Not enough children's apps have proper theme songs. Lucy Ladybird does, and with it comes a well-crafted story of the heroine's search for her spots. Digital colouring, karaoke and a spider-hunting mini-game are also included, with more materials available on its website for parents and children to enjoy together.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marc-masterpieces-architecture/id684253307?mt=8\">marc - Masterpieces of Architecture (Free)</a></h2><p>Something for travellers here: an app that promises \"the top 25 masterpieces of Budapest\" – as in buildings – with more cities to follow in subsequent updates. Expect photos, drawings, tours and location features showing you how to get to each building. Architectural tourists will love it.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/habitrpg/id689569235?mt=8\">HabitRPG (Free)</a></h2><p>A fun attempt to blend roleplaying game mechanics with a productivity app. Or, as the App Store listing puts it: \"Habit tracking which treats your goals like a Role Playing Game. Level up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor.\" It's the official spin-off from the HabitRPG website, used to motivate everything from calling your mum to working out.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/national-trust-postcards/id692743720?mt=8\">National Trust Postcards (Free)</a></h2><p>There are a number of apps that turn your iPhone photos into physical postcards, but how many of them actually benefit the places you're snapping pics of?

        "headline":"Fifa 14 on PS4 and Xbox One: spectacle, human drama and better headers",
        "body":"<p>At the Electronic Arts stand in the business hall at Gamescom, a couple of demo units were offering hands-on time with Fifa 14 on PlayStation 4. There was always a crowd around the screens; every journalist I talked to had spent time there, either waiting impatiently, or playing a match. It looks beautiful and plays with a fluidity that, in snatched instances, makes it seem photo-realistic. </p><p>But how much extra technology, time and effort has the team been able to put into the next-generation versions of the latest Fifa title? And what are the most obvious new features we can expect?</p><p>To find out, I cornered the game's executive producer, Dave Rutter, and asked about the big changes and little extras. Here's what he had to say.</p><p><strong>At EA's Gamescom press conference, you talked about how you're planning to increase the sense of theatre and spectacle with the next-gen console versions of Fifa. Can you tell us more about that?</strong></p><p>\"For us, the whole next generation thing is build on three main foundations. First, it's about true human emotion, so we've done a ton of work on animation technology and animation variety; the way the players look and move. The second part of it is the behavioural aspect of the players – we've done a lot on ensuring they have human intelligence, predictive physics, so that they can avoid collisions, all that kind of stuff. </p><p>\"The third part is about the whole scene of the game. And it is a scene: the players are the actors, but there are other things going on. If you look at broadcast football footage, we've spent a lot of time with Sky to try and figure out how we can duplicate what TV is doing. One of our producers spent days in the Sky studio, staying with them from the start, all the way through broadcast and then afterwards, to kind of think like a director does. </p><p>\"The way it works is, there's obviously the story of the match itself and the players who are involved in it, then there's the meta story around the teams and the league and everything else. So on the one hand you have Gareth Bale leaving Spurs and joining Real Madrid, so in the build-up to that transfer, the camera and commentary would focus more on Bale, on his position in the Spurs squad and how it's in doubt. Then imagine a future in which Spurs end up playing Real Madrid, so Bale ends up playing against his old club … it's like the old story of when Sol Campbell left Spurs to join the Gooners, we're trying to capture that drama in Fifa matches. </p><p>\"So we've created a Game Director tool now that tracks the heat maps for the players – who is hot, who isn't, who is going to overtake who to become the next talking point. This is all from the data that we seed the game with. If Lionel Messi is playing, he will be the focus, but if he misses a couple of chances, the commentary will take a very different stance. Or if [Andrés] Iniesta is on for a hat-trick, then the focus is going to start following him. </p><p>\"Then we have some jaw-dropping camera technology with nice high pans over the stadium. There's also the fact that the crowds are now fully-realised 3D and exhibiting behaviours appropriate to what's going on. You'll see the crowd going nuts when a goal has been scored, but nothing from the supporters of the team that's just conceded. There are also sideline characters: interactions with the ball boys, for example.\" </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416331747'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/2/1378124492796/Fifa-14-2-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Is this all about adding to the atmosphere, or are there ramifications for the play?</strong></p><p>\"One thing we didn't do a great job of showing off in the Gamescom presentation is the fact that there are no cuts in the game now. In the past, if the ball went out of play and we had to get the players down one end of the pitch for a corner, the camera would cut and we'd teleport all the players to the correct spots then bring the camera back up. Now everyone actually moves to where they need to be – we don't need to leave the game; everything keeps running under AI. If there are two balls on the pitch, say because one has gone out but bounced back in off the siding, a player will go across and kick it off. It's all just seamless.\" </p><p><strong>Is the player AI completely different for the next-gen consoles than it is for the current gen versions of the game?</strong></p><p>\"Parts of it are brand new and parts of it are extensions. The actual footballing parts are mostly extensions, but a lot of the behavioural stuff is new, in particular what we call 'pro instincts', which I'd probably describe as the anti-collision system. Players try to avoid each other and any collisions that might end in them getting hurt – they brace for impact or swim around other players. That's all driven by a new physics system which is part of the player impact engine that we can't do on current consoles. The heading AI is also totally new because we can't run multiple players trying to head the same ball on current-gen machines. So those big bundles you get in the box – we can now do those, which is really nice. It's a lot of those things you take for granted in real football that you probably haven't noticed are missing from our game – that is coming now.\" </p><p><strong>So it sounds like we're going to get a lot more complexity and intricacy in interactions on pitch now.</strong></p><p>\"Yes. I was trying to describe this to someone earlier when they asked 'what's the best piece of advice you can give to someone when they're just starting to play the new versions of the game?' For me it's two things. You should use the shoot button to clear the ball, because now you'll get up and do a really good clearance header. And actually for the attacking team the new header system is great because you can actually power <em>and</em> direct it with the stick – you can actually aim the headers now. And also I'd say, you should master the new shooting, which is nice. The synergy of being able to run up and take a proper shot, do volleys and everything like that … it makes shooting extremely rewarding.\" </p><p><strong>Are there any differences in the shooting systems between current and next-gen machines?</strong></p><p>It's a shared technology, but a big part of the next-gen versions is the variety of animation. Shots will look a lot nicer. But the system is the same. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416331748'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/2/1378124645439/Fifa-14-3-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 3' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>So what do you think is the biggest change in the <em>feel</em> of playing between the two generations?</strong></p><p>\"Well, the most obvious change is the look of it – when we first started with it, we were sceptical about whether 1,080p would make much of a difference – it does. The resolution of the graphics is a lot better, but we're able to stay at 60 frames-per-second. It's super smooth and responsive. </p><p>\"The other thing that may strike you if you're a veteran Fifa player will be the variety of animations, the believability of the actions and the outcomes – it's so well meshed together. The things that make you sit up and take notice are what I call the future physics, it's the pro instincts stuff, so the players avoiding each other … in previous Fifa's you had a player impact engine which gave you my catchphrase: 'a near limitless variety of outcomes'. But ultimately, that was a visual thing, you ran up to the leg and you either fell over it or you didn't. Now, what you can do is, the player will try to avoid hitting the other player, with a range of outcomes, so you have variety within the actual collision. You have these moments when a player will stumble but then keep his run going – it's so nice. The first time it happens to you, when you think you're going down but you don't and you get through on goal; or one of those moments when an attacking player has got past you, but you just manage to knock him off canter … all of those moments are really special.\"</p><p><strong>In the past, players of both Fifa and Pes have been able to find idiosyncrasies in the game engines, which can be used as exploits to score limitless goals from certain positions. With improving AI and physics, are those days over?</strong></p><p>\"Probably yes, but at the same time I'm not naive enough to think that, after many hours of play, someone isn't going to be able to find something to exploit. In previous Fifas it's been Ronaldo at the front by himself, and then massive lofted through balls to him. We try to make sure stuff like that doesn't happen – indeed, we ended up pulling the demo on 360 and PS3 a while back because it had an exploit in it for near guaranteed goals. We have over 300 testers at the moment hammering the hell out of the game, plus the game team, plus extended sessions in the office among ourselves. It's a labour of love and we hate to think that stuff gets through. But going from 300 testers to a couple of million people getting the game at home … within 24 hours they've exceeded all the pre-release testing we've done. It's a scary proposition.\" </p><p><strong>Briefly, the Ultimate Team Legends feature, where you're providing 40 classic players in the Xbox one edition of the mode – did the whole team just get together and go through their old Panini sticker albums for inspiration?</strong></p><p>\"It's a weird story. We've been talking about it for a while, and on the one hand, we wanted to make it appropriate for our fans, the vast majority of whom aren't going to appreciate a ton of players from the 50s and 60s – so we stuck mostly to the late 80s and 90s. </p><p>\"The second part of it was ensuring that we covered as many countries as possible and all of the positions. Ultimately though, there are some stand-out characters who just make sense. A few years ago, someone asked me who was the most impressive footballer I'd ever actually seen play – and for me, Teddy Sheringham always sticks out. He had such an amazing awareness on the pitch, he outplayed people with his cunning and guile. But also as an England and Leicester City fan, I look at Gary Lineker and think, what a hero. </p><p>\"But the funny part is, you talk to everyone, and they all have their own choices. So Legends started as an email thread and, oh my god, there were 60-or-so people arguing about who should or should not be on the list. There were some … humorous conversations.\" </p><p><strong>Can you add to the roster?</strong></p><p>\"The plan at the moment is 40 will do for this year. As for the future, I don't know … But if it's successful, it's something we all feel passionate about.\"</p><p><strong>Finally, what do you think about the next-gen consoles as a development team?</strong></p><p>\"We're dead lucky – the team that I work with is just the best, and we had stuff up and running very quickly. Both the systems are pretty good to work on. The brilliant part of it for us is that they have just opened the door to all this stuff we've not been able to do. The question around crowds has come up before: 'when are you going to have good crowds?!' There's nothing stopping us doing good crowds apart from the fact that other things have been more important – we've had to invest where it really matters to everyone. The football on the pitch has to be as good as it possibly can be. Now, we don't have to worry about prioritising things quite so much. We've basically done all the luxury items and we haven't had to stress about performance. With the next-gen consoles, it's basically down to, 'OK, what do we <em>want</em> to do now?'</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416326622|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|95270027d3a1f4426334ff2abaac6a7e25b2b821 -->",

        "headline":"20 best Android apps this week",
        "body":"<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for Android smartphones and tablets.</p><p>It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. The equivalent iOS roundup will be published later in the day.</p><p>For now, read on for this week's Android selection (and when you've finished, check out previous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/best-android-apps\">Best Android apps</a> posts).</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diggreader\">Digg (Free)</a></h2><p>Web 2.0 veteran Digg has been reinvented in recent times, promising to serve up \"the most interesting and talked-about stories on the Internet\", from blog posts to videos and social networking updates. Its app is one of a number jostling for position as replacements for Google Reader, enabling you to hoover up RSS feeds and share stories to social networks.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojotouch.simon\">Simon The Sorcerer (£2.70)</a></h2><p>A generation of gamers has fond memories of adventure game Simon the Sorcerer, which first came out 20 years ago. Now it's been revived for modern-day Android devices, with controls tweaked for touchscreens. As before, it sees novice pointyhat Simon dealing with \"goblins, dwarves, swamplings, stupid wizards and sleeping giants\".</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.repix.android&amp;hl=en\">Repix (Free)</a></h2><p>Another photo-sharing app? Well, this is more about photo-editing: the emphasis with Repix is on what you do to your photos before sharing them to various social services. Filters, yes, but also \"handcrafted effect brushes\" to touch up your shots with more than 30 effects, and simple cropping and adjustments tools.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobage.ww.a1431.Puzzles_Android\">Monster Match (Free)</a></h2><p>Monster Match got me hooked on holiday last week with its combination of match-three puzzling and Pokemon-style monster-collecting. It sees you finding and battling more than 225 beasties by matching gems, with plenty of nuances in balancing the various abilities and levelling up. The inspiration is fairly clear: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.gungho.padEN&amp;hl=en_GB\">Puzzle &amp; Dragons</a>, currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/may/14/puzzle-and-dragons-gungho-revenues\">one of the most lucrative mobile games in the world</a>. But you can't yet play that here in the UK, so Monster Match is worth a look.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.mindstorms.robotcommander\">Lego Mindstorms Commander (Free)</a></h2><p>Parents! If you've got £299.99 spare for the new Lego Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit for your children (or, indeed, for yourself) you'll be wanting to get the companion Commander app too. It's used as a touchscreen controller for the various robots (Ev3rstorm, R3ptar, Track3r, Spik3r and Gripp3r) that you can build from the kit, including the ability to create your own commands.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.skylanders.cloudpatrol\">Skylanders Cloud Patrol (£1.28)</a></h2><p>And in more parental-spending-warning news, here's the latest Skylanders game from Activision: a shooty action game that gets kids to blast troll characters and string combos together to boost their score as high as possible. As on other Skylanders games, children can also scan in the physical toys to play with them in the game.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crescentmoongames.siegecraftdefender\">Siegecraft Defender (£1.92)</a></h2><p>Your Android device is surrounded by an army of tower defence games, edging in from every angle. Apt, really. Siegecraft Defender is the latest, from developer Crescent Moon Games, and it's very good indeed as lizardmen battle knights in the world of the Siegecraft games. Impressive graphics and plenty of depth help this stand out from the hordes of rivals.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.duplo.trains\">Lego Duplo Train (Free)</a></h2><p>More Lego, but this time it's the company's toddler brand Duplo providing the entertainment. Aimed at two year-olds, it's a colourful train-based game where they build their own trains, bridges and then drive around them.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikpok.fkfg2.play\">Flick Kick Field Goal 2014 (Free)</a></h2><p>I've had to uninstall the Flick Kick Football game several times after it got in the way of work, and developer PikPok has a good record with making other sports just as addictive too. This new Flick Kick Field Goal game focuses on American Football kicking, as you flick your balls (so to speak) to get as high a score as possible.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fld.DarkNebula.EP2\">Dark Nebula HD - Episode Two (Free)</a></h2><p>It's another good week for Android games, with this a sequel to developer Free Lunch Design's first episode of Dark Nebula HD. It's a ball-based puzzler where you tilt to move through 19 levels, with lots of obstacles and enemies trying to impede your progress.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quip.quip\">Quip (Free)</a></h2><p>Quip is a much-talked-about new word processing app for Android that – from this week – is available in the UK as well as the US. The schtick: it groups documents and messages about them in a chat-like \"thread of updates\", making collaboration clearer. It works across Android, iOS and desktop computers too.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.mindstorms.dddbuilder\">Lego Mindstorms 3D Builder (Free)</a></h2><p>The second of three Lego Mindstorms EV3 apps out this week alongside the kit itself: this is the instructions for actually building the five robots, with zoomable and rotatable 3D diagrams of every step in the process. Essentially it's a replacement for traditional printed instructions, to (hopefully) reduce your swearing as you build the bots for/with an expectant child.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cipherprime.pulse\">Pulse (£2)</a></h2><p>Pulse was excellent when it came out on iOS a while back, and looks just as impressive on Android. It's a musical game where \"players become part conductor, part note-captor, part multi-touch master\", tapping notes as they move around the circular environment. Hypnotic and rather marvellous.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.cw.olliethecat\">Ollie the Cat (Free)</a></h2><p>More fun for pre-school children here with Ollie, a cat who wants to help children learn to count by spotting animals in his garden. Narrated by a seven year-old – something that I've seen generally appeals to younger children – its illustrations have plenty of character. Soon, it'll get an extra Ollie's Colours story (bought via in-app purchase) to do the same thing for colours.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LockedDoorPuzzle.KairoMobile\">Kairo (£3.15)</a></h2><p>More exploration and puzzle-solving here: Kairo sees you wending your way through \"vast abandoned monuments\" figuring out what's going on and why you're there. It's big on atmosphere rather than whiz-bang action, and all the better for it.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.mindstorms.fixthefactory\">Lego Mindstorms Fix Factory (Free)</a></h2><p>One last Lego Mindstorms app this week: this doesn't work with the real robotics kit, but is rather a puzzle game starring one of them, Ev3rstorm. It sees him exploring a factory looking for lost battery packs: a simple but fun-looking introduction to the new range.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.upnpcast\">Cast To UPnP/DLNA for GMusic (Free)</a></h2><p>Google's new Chromecast dongle, Apple's AirPlay and other technology means slinging media from smartphones to other household devices is front of mind this year. Here's an app for streaming music from the Google Play service – including cloud lockers and the All Access subscription service – to devices that support UPnP/DLNA connectivity. In other words, Chromecast-like abilities for devices that can't be used with Chromecast.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotemu.thelastexpress\">The Last Express (£3)</a></h2><p>Jordan Mechner is probably best known as the creator of Prince of Persia, but this is another of his games reworked for Android devices. Originally released in 1997 for PCs: an adventure on the Orient Express with a \"maelstrom of treachery, romance, and international intrigue\".</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.animocacollective.google.catdefense\">Cats vs Dragons (Free)</a></h2><p>Not, as such, a fair fight. Or is it? Cats vs Dragons is an RPG-strategy game where the cats punch (claw?) above their wright, battling through a succession of towers duffing up dragons, looting Cat Coins and levelling up. It looks pretty fun, with in-app purchases used to boost your chances.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.clipless\">Clipless (Free)</a></h2><p>Although more focused on the US and Canada, Clipless is available here in the UK too. It's a \"contextual deal locator\" that aims to ping you when there's a discount available at a business near your current location, hoovering up information from more than 2,000 separate discount sites.</p><p>That's this week's selection, but what do you think?

Posting on its official Facebook page, the organisation inadvertently revealed the name of the next Halo installment.</p></blockquote><p>No other details at present, of course.</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://uk.gamespot.com/shows/reality-check/?event=how-free-to-play-exploits-your-brain-20130901&amp;tag=Topslot;Slot1\">Reality Check - How Free-to-play Exploits your Brain | GameSpot.com</a></h2><p>Another thought provoking video from Cam Robinson, this time the first in a two-parter about the psychology of free-to-play games:</p><p>Effectively: \"this is your brain; this is your brain on F2P games...\"</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/09/01/pax-mega-man-creator-announces-mighty-no-9\">PAX: Mega Man Creator Announces Mighty No. 9 | IGN</a></h2><p>Fans of classic 2D platforming rejoice:</p><blockquote><p>At PAX today, Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune announced Mighty No. 9, a new project seeking funding on Kickstarter.</p><p>According to the project page, Mighty No. 9 features \"classic Japanese side-scrolling action\" in which the player takes on the role of Beck, \"the 9th in a line of powerful robots, and the only one not infected by a mysterious computer virus that has caused mechanized creatures the world over to go berserk.\"</p><p>Gameplay sound similar to Mega Man in that players \"run, jump, blast, and transform your way through six stages\" that can be completed in any order. Players will steal weapons and abilities from enemies they defeat, and Beck's \"body itself can also reconfigure into new shapes, allowing for all kinds of new skills and abilities.\"</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.vg247.com/2013/09/02/whore-of-the-orient-title-sparks-potential-human-rights-commission-complaint/\">Whore of the Orient title sparks potential Human Rights Commission complaint | VG247</a></h2><p>Some potential trouble for La Noire developer, Team Bondi, on its new game:</p><blockquote><p>City of Monash councillor Jieh-Yung Lo has called for Team Bondi to change the title of its next game, Whore of the Orient, and will take the matter to the Human Rights Commission if necessary.</p><p>The Age reports Lo is acting privately, not in his role as councillor, in drawing attention to a case which may be brought before the Human Rights Commission on grounds of racial vilification. He has called on Team Bondi to change the title and halt development of the project, although as a gamer himself and an L.A. Noire fan, would be content with a new title.</p><p>\"It's the use of the word 'Orient', more even than the word 'whore', that is the issue. The O-word is very similar to the N-word for African-American communities. It's a 19th century racial-colonial conception and it's especially painful for older people in the communities. That was a very bad time in China, and people don't want or need to have that dragged up,\" Lo said.</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-what-the-xbox-one-dash-means-for-gamers\">Beyond live TV - what the Xbox One user interface means for gamers</a></h2><p>Interesting stuff on the Xbox one interface from Eurogamer and Digital Foundry:</p><blockquote><p>What was novelty - if technically impressive - technology on the original Kinect forms a fundamental basis of interaction with Xbox One, and from what we saw at Gamescom, parallels with Xbox 360 hold little water. Voice control on Xbox One actually works and it seems to be genuinely useful. It should be faster than using the joypad for certain functions, but ideally you'd use both in concert. And as for Xbox's isolation from the rest of the components in your system, that is now clearly a thing of the past.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Other stuff</strong></h2><p><em>Games we've heard about, things we're interested in...</em></p><h2><a href=\"http://modernplaying.com/#about\">GameCity Modern Playing events announced</a></h2><p>The organisers of the brilliant GameCity festival are kicking off a series of touring events with talks and debates about game culture, as well as playable titles.

        "headline":"Phablets are big in Asia-Pacific, equalling tablets and laptops combined",
        "body":"<p>\"Phablets\", the large-screened phones with screen sizes of between 5in and 7in diagonally, sold as well as tablets and laptops combined in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter, says research company IDC.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prSG24296513\">news</a> indicates that the smartphone business has created a new category lying between the standard smartphone and the tablet, first mapped out by Dell with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Streak\">Streak</a> phone in June 2010, but subsequently capitalised on by Samsung with its Galaxy Note and successors.</p><p>A total of 25.2m \"phablets\" shipped in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), compared to 12.6m tablets (over 7in) and 12.7m portable PCs, IDC said.</p><p>Phablet shipments have grown dramatically - doubling between the first and second quarter, and rising sixfold compared to the same time last year.</p><p>However Samsung's principal rival in the smartphone space, Apple, is unlikely to be able to capitalise on the popularity of phablets this year. Its new iPhones, expected to be unveiled this month, will be using the same 4in screen seen in last year's iPhone 5, according to leaks from the supply chain over the past few months. That suggests that it would not be able to introduce a \"phablet\"-style device before 2014 - even if it wants to.</p><p>Analysts had foreseen the potential for 2013 to be \"the year of the phablet\" in January, after noting the rapid rise of the large-screened phones in 2012. That month saw China's Huawei and ZTE both launch their own versions at the Consumer Electronics Show. Taiwan's HTC has also followed with its own \"Butterfly\" model.</p><p>Samsung more recently staked out the top end of the phablet space with its 6.3in Galaxy Mega, unveiled in April.</p><p>\"Users have realised that a nearly 5-inch screen isn't such a cumbersome device,\" said Joshua Flood of ABI Research in January, and forecast then that countries such as Japan and South Korea, and then India, China and Malaysia, would be major markets for the larger devices.</p><p>Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics was more straightforward: \"We expect 2013 to be the year of the phablet,\" he said in January.</p><p>Flood's forecast has been borne out, with phablets accounting for 30% of all smartphone sales in India.</p><p>The key beneficiary is Samsung, whose Galaxy Note range - due to be enhanced this week with the Note 3 on Wednesday - had nearly 50% of the market.</p><p>But it has had to fight off rivals which have jumped onto the bandwagon. At its launch at the end of 2011, the Note had 90% of the much smaller phablet space. </p><p>Their <a href=\"http://www.icharts.net/chartchannel/apej-portable-pc-tablet-and-phablet-shipments-2011-q4-2013-q2_m33rycjbc\">popularity</a> points to a regional preference for larger screens which can be used to carry out work on the go, rather than separate functions to a smaller smartphone and larger tablet.</p><p>The Asia/Pacific region, and especially China, are seen as a key battleground for the smartphone business as western markets such as North America and Europe move past the early burst of adoption, and sales growth there slows down. By contrast countries such as China, India and others are seeing rapid uptake.</p><p>\"Phablets first started as a trend driven by mature markets like South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore – and these markets continue to rise,\" said Melissa Chau, senior research manager for IDC's Asia/Pacific client device team. \"What's changed now is the added pick up of phablets in emerging markets like China and India, not just the plethora of big-name vendors competing head-to-head with Samsung, but instead the low-cost local players who have swooped in to offer big screens for less money – averaging a retail price of US$220 versus Samsung's US$557.\" </p><p>Dell lost out by being too early to the market with the Streak, introducing it at a time when most users had smaller phones with screens under 4in diagonally. But the rise in smartphone penetration, and the shift to more data-centric uses such as maps, has made big screens popular - particularly in countries where the device needs to serve multiple computing needs.</p><p>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416302289|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|07112ea1e45bccc5df2361e545eeb360381fb8a6 -->",

Although its screen is square, large bezels on the top and bottom give it a chunky, rectangular shape, with rounded corners.</p><p>The color is fairly basic — dark black and grey, although it may be enhanced in the final version. The wristband is clunky and masculine, large enough to hold speakers in the clasp. It's not heavy to hold, but it dwarfed my tiny lady wrists when I tried it on. Women may instead opt for a Misfit Shine, which isn't a watch but is a small jewel-like button.</p><p>The smartwatch prototype has Bluetooth to connect with the Galaxy S family of smartphones and tablets, although it may also connect to all Android devices. It also has Wi-Fi for Internet access, including e-mail, even when it's not connected to a smartphone, but I didn't see that in action.</p></blockquote><p>Not forgetting the 3MP camera in the wristband. (This repeats the \"10-hour battery life\" spec seen last week.)</p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/report-after-patent-loss-apple-tweaks-facetime-and-logs-500000-complaints/\">Report: After patent loss, Apple tweaks FaceTime — and logs 500,000 complaints &gt;&gt; Ars Technica</a></h2><blockquote><p>Apple has handed over its customer service logs from April through mid-August to VirnetX's attorneys. At the August 15 hearing, a VirnetX lawyer stated that Apple had logged \"over half a million calls\" complaining about the quality of FaceTime, according to Lease.</p><p>If that's accurate, the data will bolster VirnetX's arguments that its patents are technologically significant, hard to work around, and deserve a high royalty rate. The judge and lawyers present at the hearing didn't discuss numbers regarding what a reasonable ongoing royalty might be, but VirnetX is asking for royalty payments of more than $700m for the ongoing use of FaceTime, according to Lease.</p></blockquote><p>Only one query on this: how do people complain about FaceTime call quality? It seems unlikely that people would make a Facetime call and then call Apple to complain. </p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/major-tv-torrent-site-thebox-bz-calls-it-quits-130829/\">Major TV torrent site TheBox.bz calls it quits &gt;&gt; TorrentFreak</a></h2><blockquote><p>One of the internet's most-loved torrent sites for TV show content has decided to call it quits.

The site's operators inform TorrentFreak that they aren't reacting to any particular threat, but with City of London Police and other interested parties watching over the site, trouble is only just around the corner.</p><p>BitTorrent is perfect for distributing all kinds of content, from movies to music and from software to backups. However, there is one particular type of content that users rarely seem to tire of.</p><p>TV show downloading is a very popular pastime among file-sharers. The ability to grab almost any show from the present or even distant past and watch it at a time and place of a user's choosing is a powerful lure.</p></blockquote><p>They missed off \"for free\" as part of the attraction and \"in breach of copyright\" as part of the proviso. </p><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://dashes.com/anil/2013/08/a-brief-history-of-apples-iwatch.html\">A Brief History of Apple's iWatch &gt;&gt; Anil Dash</a></h2><blockquote><p>A brief timeline of Apple iWatch's entrance to the market.</p><p>September 10, 2013: As key members of the tech industry and trade press gather on a clear Tuesday morning, Tim Cook leads much of Apple's senior management in the introduction of a simple, wearable touchscreen device.

One developer likens it to writing PC software in the 1990s, when a programmer had to test against a handful of versions of the Windows operating system, along with scores of possible hardware configurations. But it means that writing Android software is significantly more complex than writing apps for iOS, where Apple keeps hardware configurations to a minimum and where the vast majority of users run the latest version of the operating system.</p><p>And it's even more of a headache when compared to web technologies like JavaScript and HTML. These webby alternatives were supposed to replace native apps, letting developers write one version of software that runs on all devices. But consumers have largely rejected web apps.</p><p>Developers who brave the matrix of pain often have to make some compromises.</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/ios-and-android-weaknesses-allow-stealthy-pilfering-of-website-credentials/\">iOS and Android weaknesses allow stealthy pilfering of website credentials &gt;&gt; Ars Technica</a></h2><blockquote><p>The so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy\">same-origin policy</a> is a fundamental security mechanism enforced by desktop browsers, but the protection is woefully missing from many iOS and Android apps. To demonstrate the threat, the researchers devised several hacks that carry out so-called cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks to surreptitiously download user data from handsets.</p><p>The most serious of the attacks worked on both iOS and Android devices and required only that an end-user click on a booby-trapped link in the official Google Plus app. Behind the scenes, a script sent instructions that caused a text-editing app known as PlainText to send documents and text input to a Dropbox account controlled by the researchers. The attack worked against other apps, including TopNotes and Nocs.</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://crackberry.com/what-tens-millions-q10-sales-mean-blackberry\">April 2013: What tens of millions of Q10 sales mean for BlackBerry ??

As Kevin [Michaluk] points out, the surge of new visitors related to the Z10 and Q10 launch traffic has now disappeared. Traffic is back to where it was prior to the launch of BlackBerry 10. There's still a BIG audience on CrackBerry, it's just not growing the way you'd expect it to grow if a lot of people were buying and using their BlackBerry 10 phones on a continued basis (conversely, CrackBerry's sister site AndroidCentral.com is seeing this type of long tail growth on the back of the launch of the S4 and HTC One).</p></blockquote><p><hr /></p><h2><a href=\"http://readwrite.com/2013/08/30/google-apple-sync-consumer-casualties?awesm=readwr.it_ccG#awesm=~og08E5Pj70SJxm\">Why Apple and Google can't sync right — and don't care if you suffer &gt;&gt; ReadWrite</a></h2><p>Matt Asay: </p><blockquote><p>I've dumped iCloud for everything but synchronization of Notes from my MacBook Air to my iPhone and iPad.

        "headline":"Smartwatches: what are Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft up to?",
        "body":"<p>\"The wrist is interesting,\" <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2013/05/29/apples-tim-cook-points-to-dearth-of-multiple-use-wrist-gadgets/\">said Apple chief executive Tim Cook</a> at the All Things Digital D11 conference in May 2013, when being quizzed about his company's potential plans for wearable technology in the years to come.</p><p>\"For something to work here you have to convince people it's so incredible, that they want to wear it... If we had a room full of 10 to 20-year-olds and we said, 'Everyone stand up that has a watch,' I'm not sure anybody would stand up.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, Apple is one of the technology giants at the centre of growing speculation about smartwatches. Along with Samsung – whose Galaxy Gear is expected to be unveiled later this week – Google and Microsoft, the wrist is proving interesting for anyone who's anyone in the smartphone world.</p><p>Research firm Canalys recently claimed that 500,000 smartwatches will be sold this year, but then 5m in 2014 thanks to the entry of Apple, Samsung, Google and other technology firms into the market, alongside traditional watch-makers. </p><p>Rival IDC even thinks that <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24291713\">demand for wearables (including watches) could slow down tablet sales</a> over the coming years, reducing its forecasts accordingly. So what do we know – or, to be more accurate, what's been rumoured – about the plans of the big tech firms?</p><h2>Apple</h2><p>Apple has been rumoured to be making a smartwatch for some time now – it's a perennial rumour alongside an Apple television, hence those questions for Cook. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/01/apple-register-iwatch-trademark\">Apple's registration of iWatch as a trademark</a> in Japan in June this year only fanned the flames of that speculation.</p><p>That came after a New York Times report claiming that the company had been <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/disruptions-apple-is-said-to-be-developing-a-curved-glass-smart-watch/?smid=tw-share\">\"experimenting with wristwatch-like devices made of curved glass\"</a> and running  iOS software.</p><p>Past employees have been speculating too: <a href=\"http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/\">interface expert Bruce Tognazzini claimed the \"iWatch\" would</a> \"fill a gaping hole in the Apple ecosystem. It will facilitate and coordinate not only the activities of all the other computers and devices we use, but a wide array of devices to come\".</p><p>Fellow ex-Appler <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/mar/11/apple-iwatch-technology-monday-note\">Jean-Louis Gassée provided his own opinions back in March</a>, suggesting that \"the iWatch will enrich the iOS ecosystem: Reasonably useful on its own, but most important as a way to increase the value/enjoyment of other iDevices… at least for now.\"</p><p>In July, reports suggested that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/15/apple-iwatch-hiring-outside-expertise\">Apple had made a number of \"acqui-hires\" of small companies</a> to build its \"iWatch\" team, sitting within a wider wearables group at the company. The Financial Times claimed that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a3cbfce-ec0f-11e2-bfdb-00144feabdc0.html\">Apple had been forced to turn to outsiders</a> to help with \"hard engineering problems that they've not been able to solve\" in-house.</p><p>In August, reports in Taiwan claimed that two local companies, Quanta and Inventec, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/29/apple-iwatch-suppliers-samsung\">won the contracts to build Apple's first smartwatch</a>, with suggestions that they could build up to 38m units in 2014 – although CIMB Securities analyst Wanli Wang predicted 63m units shipping in the first year after the device launched.</p><h2>Samsung</h2><p>Plenty of details have leaked out about Samsung's smartwatch plans: it's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/16/samsung-apple-smartwatch-galaxy-gear-release\">expected to be called the Galaxy Gear</a>, and will be unveiled on 4 September ahead of the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin.</p><p>Last weekend, VentureBeat claimed a scoop: <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/01/this-is-samsungs-galaxy-gear-smartwatch-a-blocky-health-tracker-with-a-camera/\">actual pictures of the Galaxy Gear</a>, although the description – \"a blocky health tracker with a camera\" – didn't exactly whet the appetite.</p><p>The emphasis was firmly on fitness though: \"My initial impression was that it's a new wearable fitness device to rival a Nike Fuelband or Fitbit Flex — a smartphone companion rather than a smartphone alternative,\" wrote journalist Christina Farr. Separately, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/373185266720055296/photo/1\">shots of Samsung's app for controlling the watch</a> have also leaked, via the @evleaks Twitter account.</p><p>The expectation: a device designed as a companion to Samsung's Galaxy range of Android smartphones. As with other companies mentioned here, the inspiration is thought to be as much fitness-tracking bands by the likes of Jawbone, Nike and Fitbit rather than trying to squeeze a smartphone's guts into a watch-shaped device.</p><h2>Google</h2><p>It's just emerged that <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/08/30/google-wimm-labs-smartwatch-acquisition/\">Google quietly bought a smartwatch startup called Wimm Labs</a> in 2012: the company had released its own <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/9/2546990/wimm-one-review\">WIMM One</a> smartwatch in 2011 before shutting down in 2012 due to \"an exclusive, confidential relationship for our technology\". Google.</p><p>WIMM had been trying to build a platform for developers rather than just a device, although within Google it's now part of an even bigger platform and developer community: Android. Yet the other interesting thing about the WIMM One was its ability to work as a standalone gadget with its own apps, rather than simply controlling apps on a paired smartphone.</p><p>News of the acquisition made previous Google smartwatch rumours worth a second reading. The Financial Times reported in March, for example, that <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2013/03/google-smart-watch/?\">Google was working on a smartwatch project</a> within its Android unit, and cited a <a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.htm&amp;r=23&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=(20121002.PD.%20AND%20Google.ASNM.)&amp;OS=ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google&amp;RS=(ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google)\">patent application by the company from 2011</a> for a \"smart-watch\" including a \"tactile user interface\".</p><p>The Wall Street Journal followed that up in June with claims that<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323689204578571992848684764-lMyQjAxMTAzMDIwNzEyNDcyWj.html\"> a smartwatch was being developed alongside a games console</a>, both powered by Android, as Google moved more into hardware. There was a hint that the two devices may be in competition in terms of securing a commercial release: \"The Internet giant hopes to design and market the devices itself and release at least one of them this fall,\" as journalist Amir Efrati put it.</p><h2>Microsoft</h2><p>Microsoft and smartwatches? There's some history behind that: the company's SPOT platform tempted the likes of Fossil, Suunto, Swatch and Tissot when its first watches launched in 2004, but <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/23/spot-watches-r-i-p-2004-2008/\">by 2008 it was toast</a>, filed alongside Tablet PC in the company's possibly-too-soon filing cabinet.</p><p>And in 2013? Suppliers to Microsoft <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324485004578423522275087936.html\">told the Wall Street Journal in April</a> that the company was sourcing components for a smartwatch prototype, including 1.5-inch displays. </p><p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/15/4524286/microsoft-surface-watch-smartwatch-testing-rumors\">The Verge followed up</a>, suggesting that devices were now being prototyped \"directly under the Surface team as the firm moves its wrist-worn device closer to reality\". The trouble with all Microsoft rumours right now, however, is that with chief executive Steve Ballmer on the way out, it's unclear what his replacement's strategy will be regarding schemes at the prototype stage.</p><h2>And the rest?</h2><p>Pebble Technology has sold more than 85,000 of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/may/21/pebble-smart-watch-kickstarter\">Pebble watches</a> since raising $10.3m to make them on Kickstarter. Sony is already on its second device, the SmartWatch 2, which went on sale earlier this year.</p><p>High-end smartwatch <a href=\"http://smartwatch.fm/blog/2013/8/30/exclusive-hyetis-crossbow-already-has-sold-300-smartwatches-at-1200-a-pop\">the Hyetis Crossbow has sold more than 300 units</a> – and that's at $1,200 per device. Intel is also testing some smartwatch devices in its labs.</p><p>\"The watch is kind of — if you want to put the time on it, that's fine,\" <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/06/17/smartwatch-intel/\">chief technology officer Justin Rattner told a Bloomberg conference</a> in June 2013. \"But if you're talking about texting today, wouldn't it be nice if you could just look at your wrist?\"</p><p>\"Almost every major consumer electronics manufacturer is now working on a smartwatch\" <a href=\"http://qz.com/101058/smart-watch-explosion/\">noted Quartz in July 2013</a>. And that's not to mention the traditional watch manufacturers.</p><p>\"Suddenly, everyone's discovered the wrist,\" Casio's chief executive Kazuo Kashio <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/technology/in-advent-of-the-smartwatch-a-name-thats-been-there-before.html?_r=0\">told the New York Times in August</a>. \"We've known for a long time it's prime real estate. We're prepared.\"</p><h2>What does this all mean?</h2><p>How much of the excitement about smartwatches is due to the desire within the technology industry (yes, including journalists) for a new category-shaking range of devices, rather than actual demand from buyers or a strong sense of why these smartwatches would be useful?</p><p>\"Smartwatches are a great idea – except for the 'smart' and 'watch' parts,\" <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2013/06/25/smartwatches-are-a-great-idea-except-for-the-smart-and-watch-parts/\">noted Time's Harry McCracken in June</a>. He went on to outline the barriers: battery life, display quality and \"no true killer apps\" – although he admitted that fitness-tracking gadgets may offer the most interesting path forward.</p><p>Even so, the interest in the future of the wrist – from Tim Cook and his fiercest rivals' companies – is genuine, as are the questions around the category's future.</p><p>Will these devices be more wrist-worn controllers for smartphones (and other devices) than running their own apps? Will they kill off the fitness-tracking bands, or provide the companies making those like Jawbone, Fitbit and Nike with a new product category to move into? Those questions won't be answered until 2014 at the earliest, whenever the Galaxy Gear goes on sale.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416339563|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|9ee4687c1168b272432e33bf5ed356d2d03b7691 -->",

        "body":"<p>The company behind the wireless Beats headphones and Nike Running gadget has unveiled the world's thinnest keyboard, with a flexible, wireless touchscreen just half a millimetre thick.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.csr.com/\" title=\"\">Cambridge-based CSR</a>, which specialises in wireless technology, showcased a prototype of the product at the IFA consumer electronics event in Berlin, but it will be 12 months before it will be available to buy.</p><p>Paul Williamson, CSR's director of low power wireless products, said the final form factor depended on how manufacturers bring the keyboard to market, although its primary use is likely to be as a lightweight, complementary external keyboard for tablet devices. \"This is a working prototype and a glimpse forward rather than something people will be buying this year,\" he said.</p><p>\"We might see lots of shapes and sizes, some as small as iPad Mini or a larger, more rigid form for a desktop PC, which could be curved, in any colour way, transparent or fitted with a leather folio.\"</p><p>Developed in partnership with Cambridge Inkjet Technology, the interface for the product is printed out and can be customised. That could mean printing bespoke keyboards in different languages with ease, or customised keyboards for functions such as video editing and for customers who would like personalised patterns or messages on their own keyboard.</p><p>The keyboard's touchscreen could also be used under a piece of paper to transcribe notes made with a pen and sync them to a computer.</p><p>CSR's research has led to wireless products that enable music streaming in the popular Beats headphones, the performance-tracking tool the Nike+ SportWatch and the Jambox speaker.</p><p>Founded in 1999, CSR is one of a cluster of successful, research-focused tech companies clustered around Cambridge and \"Silicon Fen\" who have recently discussed introducing a \"Made in Cambridge\" badge to promote their products.</p><p>\"The audio experience you're getting from Beats headphones exists because we developed it, put it out there and now it is used on a global scale,\" said Williamson.</p><p>\"People don't recognise that that kind of innovation is developed by a small number of very bright people here, and the pool of engineering talent and expertise here deserves a bit more credit than the app economy drive in the periphery of London.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416363126|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|970222c35a19b9989ef138a977b2e90b4de66640 -->",

        "headline":"Fifa 14 on PS4 and Xbox One: spectacle, human drama and better headers",
        "body":"<p>At the Electronic Arts stand in the business hall at Gamescom, a couple of demo units were offering hands-on time with Fifa 14 on PlayStation 4. There was always a crowd around the screens; every journalist I talked to had spent time there, either waiting impatiently, or playing a match. It looks beautiful and plays with a fluidity that, in snatched instances, makes it seem photo-realistic. </p><p>But how much extra technology, time and effort has the team been able to put into the next-generation versions of the latest Fifa title? And what are the most obvious new features we can expect?</p><p>To find out, I cornered the game's executive producer, Dave Rutter, and asked about the big changes and little extras. Here's what he had to say.</p><p><strong>At EA's Gamescom press conference, you talked about how you're planning to increase the sense of theatre and spectacle with the next-gen console versions of Fifa. Can you tell us more about that?</strong></p><p>\"For us, the whole next generation thing is build on three main foundations. First, it's about true human emotion, so we've done a ton of work on animation technology and animation variety; the way the players look and move. The second part of it is the behavioural aspect of the players – we've done a lot on ensuring they have human intelligence, predictive physics, so that they can avoid collisions, all that kind of stuff. </p><p>\"The third part is about the whole scene of the game. And it is a scene: the players are the actors, but there are other things going on. If you look at broadcast football footage, we've spent a lot of time with Sky to try and figure out how we can duplicate what TV is doing. One of our producers spent days in the Sky studio, staying with them from the start, all the way through broadcast and then afterwards, to kind of think like a director does. </p><p>\"The way it works is, there's obviously the story of the match itself and the players who are involved in it, then there's the meta story around the teams and the league and everything else. So on the one hand you have Gareth Bale leaving Spurs and joining Real Madrid, so in the build-up to that transfer, the camera and commentary would focus more on Bale, on his position in the Spurs squad and how it's in doubt. Then imagine a future in which Spurs end up playing Real Madrid, so Bale ends up playing against his old club … it's like the old story of when Sol Campbell left Spurs to join the Gooners, we're trying to capture that drama in Fifa matches. </p><p>\"So we've created a Game Director tool now that tracks the heat maps for the players – who is hot, who isn't, who is going to overtake who to become the next talking point. This is all from the data that we seed the game with. If Lionel Messi is playing, he will be the focus, but if he misses a couple of chances, the commentary will take a very different stance. Or if [Andrés] Iniesta is on for a hat-trick, then the focus is going to start following him. </p><p>\"Then we have some jaw-dropping camera technology with nice high pans over the stadium. There's also the fact that the crowds are now fully-realised 3D and exhibiting behaviours appropriate to what's going on. You'll see the crowd going nuts when a goal has been scored, but nothing from the supporters of the team that's just conceded. There are also sideline characters: interactions with the ball boys, for example.\" </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416331747'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/2/1378124492796/Fifa-14-2-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 2' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Is this all about adding to the atmosphere, or are there ramifications for the play?</strong></p><p>\"One thing we didn't do a great job of showing off in the Gamescom presentation is the fact that there are no cuts in the game now. In the past, if the ball went out of play and we had to get the players down one end of the pitch for a corner, the camera would cut and we'd teleport all the players to the correct spots then bring the camera back up. Now everyone actually moves to where they need to be – we don't need to leave the game; everything keeps running under AI. If there are two balls on the pitch, say because one has gone out but bounced back in off the siding, a player will go across and kick it off. It's all just seamless.\" </p><p><strong>Is the player AI completely different for the next-gen consoles than it is for the current gen versions of the game?</strong></p><p>\"Parts of it are brand new and parts of it are extensions. The actual footballing parts are mostly extensions, but a lot of the behavioural stuff is new, in particular what we call 'pro instincts', which I'd probably describe as the anti-collision system. Players try to avoid each other and any collisions that might end in them getting hurt – they brace for impact or swim around other players. That's all driven by a new physics system which is part of the player impact engine that we can't do on current consoles. The heading AI is also totally new because we can't run multiple players trying to head the same ball on current-gen machines. So those big bundles you get in the box – we can now do those, which is really nice. It's a lot of those things you take for granted in real football that you probably haven't noticed are missing from our game – that is coming now.\" </p><p><strong>So it sounds like we're going to get a lot more complexity and intricacy in interactions on pitch now.</strong></p><p>\"Yes. I was trying to describe this to someone earlier when they asked 'what's the best piece of advice you can give to someone when they're just starting to play the new versions of the game?' For me it's two things. You should use the shoot button to clear the ball, because now you'll get up and do a really good clearance header. And actually for the attacking team the new header system is great because you can actually power <em>and</em> direct it with the stick – you can actually aim the headers now. And also I'd say, you should master the new shooting, which is nice. The synergy of being able to run up and take a proper shot, do volleys and everything like that … it makes shooting extremely rewarding.\" </p><p><strong>Are there any differences in the shooting systems between current and next-gen machines?</strong></p><p>It's a shared technology, but a big part of the next-gen versions is the variety of animation. Shots will look a lot nicer. But the system is the same. </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-416331748'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/2/1378124645439/Fifa-14-3-008.jpg' alt='Fifa 14 3' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>So what do you think is the biggest change in the <em>feel</em> of playing between the two generations?</strong></p><p>\"Well, the most obvious change is the look of it – when we first started with it, we were sceptical about whether 1,080p would make much of a difference – it does. The resolution of the graphics is a lot better, but we're able to stay at 60 frames-per-second. It's super smooth and responsive. </p><p>\"The other thing that may strike you if you're a veteran Fifa player will be the variety of animations, the believability of the actions and the outcomes – it's so well meshed together. The things that make you sit up and take notice are what I call the future physics, it's the pro instincts stuff, so the players avoiding each other … in previous Fifa's you had a player impact engine which gave you my catchphrase: 'a near limitless variety of outcomes'. But ultimately, that was a visual thing, you ran up to the leg and you either fell over it or you didn't. Now, what you can do is, the player will try to avoid hitting the other player, with a range of outcomes, so you have variety within the actual collision. You have these moments when a player will stumble but then keep his run going – it's so nice. The first time it happens to you, when you think you're going down but you don't and you get through on goal; or one of those moments when an attacking player has got past you, but you just manage to knock him off canter … all of those moments are really special.\"</p><p><strong>In the past, players of both Fifa and Pes have been able to find idiosyncrasies in the game engines, which can be used as exploits to score limitless goals from certain positions. With improving AI and physics, are those days over?</strong></p><p>\"Probably yes, but at the same time I'm not naive enough to think that, after many hours of play, someone isn't going to be able to find something to exploit. In previous Fifas it's been Ronaldo at the front by himself, and then massive lofted through balls to him. We try to make sure stuff like that doesn't happen – indeed, we ended up pulling the demo on 360 and PS3 a while back because it had an exploit in it for near guaranteed goals. We have over 300 testers at the moment hammering the hell out of the game, plus the game team, plus extended sessions in the office among ourselves. It's a labour of love and we hate to think that stuff gets through. But going from 300 testers to a couple of million people getting the game at home … within 24 hours they've exceeded all the pre-release testing we've done. It's a scary proposition.\" </p><p><strong>Briefly, the Ultimate Team Legends feature, where you're providing 40 classic players in the Xbox one edition of the mode – did the whole team just get together and go through their old Panini sticker albums for inspiration?</strong></p><p>\"It's a weird story. We've been talking about it for a while, and on the one hand, we wanted to make it appropriate for our fans, the vast majority of whom aren't going to appreciate a ton of players from the 50s and 60s – so we stuck mostly to the late 80s and 90s. </p><p>\"The second part of it was ensuring that we covered as many countries as possible and all of the positions. Ultimately though, there are some stand-out characters who just make sense. A few years ago, someone asked me who was the most impressive footballer I'd ever actually seen play – and for me, Teddy Sheringham always sticks out. He had such an amazing awareness on the pitch, he outplayed people with his cunning and guile. But also as an England and Leicester City fan, I look at Gary Lineker and think, what a hero. </p><p>\"But the funny part is, you talk to everyone, and they all have their own choices. So Legends started as an email thread and, oh my god, there were 60-or-so people arguing about who should or should not be on the list. There were some … humorous conversations.\" </p><p><strong>Can you add to the roster?</strong></p><p>\"The plan at the moment is 40 will do for this year. As for the future, I don't know … But if it's successful, it's something we all feel passionate about.\"</p><p><strong>Finally, what do you think about the next-gen consoles as a development team?</strong></p><p>\"We're dead lucky – the team that I work with is just the best, and we had stuff up and running very quickly. Both the systems are pretty good to work on. The brilliant part of it for us is that they have just opened the door to all this stuff we've not been able to do. The question around crowds has come up before: 'when are you going to have good crowds?!' There's nothing stopping us doing good crowds apart from the fact that other things have been more important – we've had to invest where it really matters to everyone. The football on the pitch has to be as good as it possibly can be. Now, we don't have to worry about prioritising things quite so much. We've basically done all the luxury items and we haven't had to stress about performance. With the next-gen consoles, it's basically down to, 'OK, what do we <em>want</em> to do now?'</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416326622|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|95270027d3a1f4426334ff2abaac6a7e25b2b821 -->",

        "headline":"50 best Android games from 2013 so far",
        "body":"<p>Android gaming has been one of the slow-burning apps trends of 2013. There have always been good games available for Google-powered smartphones and tablets, but it's the increase in the quantity of quality titles that's been significant this year.</p><p>Yes, Apple's iOS still gets a fair few games first and/or exclusively, but Android is noticeably higher in many developers and publishers' priorities, leaving the virtual shelves of Google Play and Amazon Appstore well stocked.</p><p>Here's a reminder of some of the best Android games released in 2013 so far, which will hopefully provide a few download ideas for veteran Android gamers and newcomers to the platform alike, whatever your gaming tastes, drawn from The Guardian's weekly best Android apps roundups.</p><p>All prices are correct at the time of writing, and bear in mind that (Free) almost invariably means (Freemium), so expect in-app purchases.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grapefrukt.games.rymdkapsel1\">Rymdkapsel (&pound;3.29)</a></h2><p>There's something rather marvellous about Rymdkapsel: an addictive, accessible game that offers a twist on the real-time strategy genre. The emphasis is on building a space-base through Tetris-like block-placement, while fending off waves of enemies. It's simple in all the best ways.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.games.r3_row\">Real Racing 3 (Free)</a></h2><p>EA's racing threequel was controversial due to being the first freemium game in the much-loved series –&nbsp;free to play, but you pay to speed up repairs and unlock new cars faster. The game sees you racing more than 45 cars over 900 events, upgrading as you go. The graphics are spiffing, the handling works beautifully, and updates have provided extra content since its release.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.BejeweledBlitz_row\">Bejeweled Blitz (Free)</a></h2><p>Another freemium game from EA, but this time one offering match-three puzzling based on the famous Bejeweled brand. This re-engineers the game as a series of 60-second rounds where you have to score as many points as possible, using power-ups to bump up your performance, and comparing your efforts to friends.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roviostars.tinythief\">Tiny Thief (&pound;1.99)</a></h2><p>Tiny Thief was the latest game from Rovio Stars, a new publishing business that's part of Angry Birds-maker Rovio. No birds or pigs here, though: it's inspired by classic point'n'click adventure games, with the teeny-burglar hero exploring six quests to uncover delightful puzzles and surprises.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FireproofStudios.TheRoom\">The Room (&pound;1.49)</a></h2><p>Atmospheric puzzler The Room has been taxing brains on iOS and Android alike, getting you to explore a carefully-crafted 3D room solving puzzles. Everything's designed around touchscreen controls, and the puzzles themselves are genuinely brain-frazzling, providing a decent challenge.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.nimblequest\">Nimble Quest (Free)</a></h2><p>Having made its name with Tiny Tower and Pocket Planes, Nimblebit's latest freemium game was more of an action title, blending Snake gameplay with RPG-style characters and upgrades. You swipe your party of heroes to guide them through levels of increasing difficulty. It's very one-more-go-even-though-it's-2am addictive.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imangi.templerun2\">Temple Run 2 (Free)</a></h2><p>Endless runner Temple Run has been a massive hit on smartphones of all stripes, and its sequel added new features without spoiling the basic premise: swiping to jump, slide and turn your way through scenery to escape an angry, giant monkey. A recent update added sprinter Usain Bolt as a playable character, too.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.CrazyTaxi\">Crazy Taxi (&pound;4.02)</a></h2><p>Sega's Crazy Taxi has thrilled as an arcade game, a console game and now a mobile title too. The game – a port of the Dreamcast console version – sees you speeding through San Francisco-esque streets collecting and delivering passengers in the most hair-raising way possible, with two modes and a bunch of mini-games to prolong the action.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fishlabs.gof2hdallandroid2012\">Galaxy on Fire 2 HD (Free)</a></h2><p>Fishlabs' Galaxy on Fire space epics have always been reliable sources of mobile entertainment, and the latest installation is no different. It sees you shooting and trading your way across the galaxy, with more than 10 hours in its main campaign mode, and additional quests unlocked through in-app purchases.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simpsons4_row\">The Simpsons: Tapped Out (Free)</a></h2><p>This is now one of publisher EA's most successful game franchises on any device, putting you in charge of rebuilding Springfield after a nuclear meltdown. There are appearances from all the TV show's main characters, with in-app purchases used for virtual donuts to aid your progress.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-414998199\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376474394983/hundreds.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds for Android\" width=\"460\" height=\"286\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Hundreds</figcaption></figure><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.semisecretsoftware.Hundreds\">Hundreds (&pound;3.25)</a></h2><p>Circular puzzle game Hundreds sees you tapping on circles in each level to make them (and the numbers inside them) bigger – adding at least 100 points overall without them touching. Which sounds slightly tortuous written down, but the game's genius is its stripped-down simplicity, wedded to stylish visuals and fearsome addictiveness-factor.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.wheresmymickey_goo\">Where's My Mickey? (&pound;0.64)</a></h2><p>Disney had a big hit with its Where's My Water? and Where's My Perry physics-puzzle games, before applying the formula to Mickey Mouse. The game sees Mickey collecting water over more than 100 levels split into five episodes, with more available as in-app purchases.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.stfj.spelltower\">Spelltower (&pound;1.32)</a></h2><p>Word game Spelltower involves swiping tiles of letters to make words as they rise from the bottom of the screen, a bit like Boggle meets reverse-Tetris (I said a bit). Five modes offer depth, and the gameplay is very moreish indeed.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ustwo.blipblupfree\">Blip Blup (Free)</a></h2><p>Blip Blup is a hypnotically-addictive puzzle game from UK studio ustwo, which gets you tapping to fill a screen-full of tiles with colour. The complication being walls and obstacles that get in the way of your colour-pulse's path. There are more than 120 levels to work through, with an in-app purchase used to remove the game's advertisements.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.subatomicstudios.fieldrunners2\">Fieldrunners 2 (&pound;2.01)</a></h2><p>The original Fieldrunners remains one of the best tower-defence games for mobile devices, and its sequel adds plenty of new features. If you're new to the genre, it involves placing towers to fend off increasingly tough hordes of enemies, building mazes to contain and destroy the marching troops before they reach your base.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalmotion.csrracing\">CSR Racing (Free)</a></h2><p>Freemium drag-racing game CSR Racing was one of the biggest iOS hits of 2012, but its Android version has been justifiably popular this year. The game sees you buying, upgrading and racing a range of cars from Audi, BMW and other manufacturers, with an emphasis on customisation – and in-app purchases used to fund the action.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeptolab.timetravel.paid.google\">Cut the Rope: Time Travel (&pound;0.62)</a></h2><p>Cutesy monster Om Nom appeared in this, his third Cut the Rope game for Android. This time round, there's a time-travelling theme as he tries to feed sweets to his ancestors. The gameplay remains cutting ropes to solve physics-puzzles across six locations, although this time there are two on-screen monsters to feed, not one.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalreality.sinemora\">Sine Mora (&pound;3.99)</a></h2><p>This visually-impressive shoot 'em up won bags of critical acclaim on console before its Android debut. It's a horizontally-scrolling game whose graphics would blow you away, if there weren't lots of enemies trying to do exactly that. It also does a good job of catering to more casual shmup players while a well-tuned scoring system gives experts a lasting challenge.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM\">Despicable Me: Minion Rush (Free)</a></h2><p>Gameloft's official endless-runner game for the Despicable Me movies has been (apologies for this) a runaway success. It puts you in the shoes of a scampering minion for this Temple Run-style game, leaping, sliding and dodging obstacles and enemies, while earning (or buying) power-ups and costumes to boost your chances.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.distractionware.superhexagon\">Super Hexagon (&pound;1.99)</a></h2><p>I remain dreadful at Super Hexagon, spending most of my time with the game fighting the urge to throw my phone through the nearest window in frustration at my ineptitude. This is precisely why a fervent fanbase of hardcore gamers love it: a &quot;minimal action&quot; game that demands fast fingers and razor-sharp thinking.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-414998200\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376474429033/ravensword.jpg\" alt=\"Ravensword: Shadowlands\" width=\"460\" height=\"343\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Ravensword: Shadowlands</figcaption></figure><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crescentmoongames.ravensword2\">Ravensword: Shadowlands (&pound;4.63)</a></h2><p>Crescent Moon Games has won plenty of fans for its Ravensword RPG games, which are one of the franchises aiming to provide Skyrim-style open-world thrills on mobile devices. The latest sees you exploring a vast fantasy world, fighting and questing as you go.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doublefine.rad\">Dropchord (&pound;1.93)</a></h2><p>The heyday of Guitar Hero and Rock Band may have faded on console, but mobile is seeing a resurgence in innovative music games. Dropchord is the work of Double Fine Productions (of Kickstarter fame) that sees you manipulating an on-screen laser beam while dodging scratches and collecting notes. Neon-tastic visuals and a 10-track electronica soundtrack add to the fun.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.tetrisblitz_row\">Tetris Blitz (Free)</a></h2><p>The huge popularity of Bejeweled Blitz persuaded EA to try the freemium formula for the most famous puzzle game of all: Tetris. The Blitz element means two-minute sessions to score as many points as possible, boosted by power-ups, while competing against Facebook friends' performances.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.socialtitans.pdp\">Pixel Defenders Puzzle (&pound;1.39)</a></h2><p>As someone with a long-term Triple Town habit who's also played an RPG or 17, I fell hard for Pixel Defenders Puzzle. It involves matching pixels and characters to make more-powerful characters, who then attack enemies at the top of the screen. Basically it's Triple Town (also amazing, but released before this year so not in this roundup) with extra fighting, and a fantasy-RPG theme.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playfirst.playground.dinerdash\">Diner Dash (Free)</a></h2><p>Billed as &quot;the world's #1 hit time management game&quot;, Diner Dash took its time to come to Android, but was worth the wait. The game involves seating, serving and saying tara to diners as efficiently as possible to collect tips. It's a freemium game, so in-app purchases are used for boosts and upgrades.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.frozenfrontfree\">1941 Frozen Front (Free)</a></h2><p>This excellent strategy game from publisher HandyGames is set on the eastern front of the second world war, letting you play as either the German or Russian forces. It's a turn-based wargame with infantry, tanks and bombers to command, with pass-the-device multiplayer supported as well as a campaign mode.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ionage.ionage\">Ionage (Free)</a></h2><p>Ionage is a real-time strategy (RTS) game set in space &quot;where you use giant floating space platforms to do battle in a steampunk themed story of galactic conquest&quot;. It's also exclusive to Android, and while it plays nicest on tablets, developer Twice Circled claims it's been &quot;resourcefully optimised&quot; for smartphones too.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vividgames.realboxing\">Real Boxing (&pound;0.99)</a></h2><p>Great boxing games are few and far between on console, let alone mobile. Real Boxing was a palpable hit, though, with its 30-fight career mode, 20 beefy boxers to duff up, and very impressive graphics –&nbsp;particularly if your device is packing a Tegra 3 processor.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.pacmantournaments\">Pac-Man +Tournaments (Free)</a></h2><p>The freemium bug is infecting the most famous of game characters, as shown by Namco Bandai's reboot of Pac-Man earlier this year. It mixes the original arcade game with a new Tournament mode with online leaderboards. In-app purchases are used to buy virtual tokens to play the weekly tournaments, but if you're not fussed about those, you can play for free.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.ToyStorySmashIt.goo\">Toy Story: Smash It! (&pound;0.64)</a></h2><p>If Angry Birds went 3D, with the birds replaced by Buzz Lightyear and the pigs replaced by aliens, it might look like Toy Story: Smash It. Disney's game makes for colourful knock'em down fun as you scoot around 60 levels chucking balls at the aliens' defences. In theory, it's for children. In reality, parents won't be able to resist sneaking a go.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-414998201\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376474457602/punch.jpg\" alt=\"Punch Quest\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Punch Quest</figcaption></figure><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.punchquest\">Punch Quest (&pound;0.63)</a></h2><p>Punch Quest is the first game (to my knowledge) that lists one of its key features as the ability to &quot;punch an egg that turns you into a magical gnome&quot;. It's a quirky, creative action game with a stripped-down control system that works perfectly on touchscreens.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.mysingingmuppets.goo\">My Muppets Show (Free)</a></h2><p>It's time to play the music... This game from Disney turns the Muppets into a free-to-play resource management game, with a musical twist. It involves recruiting a house band from more than 20 Muppets, then keeping them happy and levelling up their skills to make beautiful music. Optional in-app purchases of virtual diamonds help to keep things swinging.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.namcobandaigames.tekkencard\">Tekken Card Tournament (Free)</a></h2><p>And another freemium revamp for a much-loved brand, with beat 'em up franchise Tekken transforming into a card-battler game. You build a deck of moves, then battle virtual and real opponents –&nbsp;with a range of real-world collectible cards due to join the fun too.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ggee.vividruntime.gg_1649\">Mushihimesama Bug Panic (&pound;2.99)</a></h2><p>This is an old favourite from Japanese developer Cave, with bullets flying all over the shop, a punishing-yet-rewarding difficulty curve, and three control systems to suit your playing style. As shoot 'em ups go, it's one of the toughest for casual players, but rewarding nonetheless.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kairosoft.android.ninja_en\">Ninja Village (&pound;2.99)</a></h2><p>If you're looking for time-sucking addictive games on Android, anything by Japanese developer Kairosoft is a good bet. This game sees you building a ninja clan and sending them into battle, while also building their village into a prosperous settlement.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bossastudios.ddd\">Deep Dungeons of Doom (Free)</a></h2><p>This pixelly-retro action game was one of the launch titles on the Android-based Ouya console, and has also been making friends on iOS. The Android version is very fun indeed, getting you to plunge down dungeons fighting and looting in a touchscreen-friendly format.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.sonic1\">Sonic The Hedgehog (&pound;2.36)</a></h2><p>Sega is certainly cashing in on its fleet-footed blue hedgehog: the original Sonic game follows two episodes of Sonic 4, Sonic CD and Sonic Jump onto Android. The famous Mega Drive game has been accurately ported across, with extra Tails &amp; Knuckles, a remastered soundtrack and a new Time Attack mode.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrush\">Kingdom Rush (&pound;1.30)</a></h2><p>There are lots of tower defence games on Android, but Kingdom Rush more than holds its own in the crowd though. The game has a fantasy setting, all orcs, elves and wizards. You'll be protecting your kingdom against more than 50 enemies, with all manner of upgrades and abilities to fuel your strategy.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luckyframe.gentlemen\">Gentlemen! (&pound;1.99)</a></h2><p>Described as a &quot;Victorian era head-to-head arcade battle for tablets&quot;, this two-player game sees your dapper duellists hurling knives, bombs and even homing pigeons at one another in a fight to the death. One of the best share-the-device multiplayer games on Android.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.king.petrescuesaga\">Pet Rescue Saga (Free)</a></h2><p>People are playing Candy Crush Saga (also out before 2013) in their tens of millions, and while this follow-up hasn't yet reached those heights, it's well worth a look. Synchronising with the existing Facebook version of the game, this offers 72 levels of block-puzzling action – with cutesy animals and social leaderboards thrown in.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftD4HM\">Dungeon Hunter 4 (Free)</a></h2><p>Gameloft's dungeon-crawling adventure is back for its fourth iteration, and like the third instalment, this is freemium. Expect more fantasy-themed hacking and slashing, as you wander through sprawling underground environments laying waste to enemies.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sidheinteractive.sif.DR\">Into the Dead (Free)</a></h2><p>Into the Dead is yet another zombie apocalypse game&nbsp;–&nbsp;Android is flush with these – but one with plenty of creativity and originality at work as you fend off the shambling undead. A cross between an endless runner and a first-person shooter, with plenty of charm.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixowl.thesandbox.android\">The Sandbox (Free)</a></h2><p>The Sandbox is one of a clutch of pixel-art creation-games to have appeared this year, inspired by Minecraft but with an emphasis on 2D worlds rather than 3D. The game offers 71 levels to work through, as you trigger chemical reactions, generate lifeforms and try to build the Pyramids.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.com2us.battleheroes.normal.freefull.google.global.android.common\">Brave Heroes (Free)</a></h2><p>This colourful action-RPG sees you putting together a team of heroes, carefully balancing their skills and devising tactics to fend off foes, levelling up as you go. Released by Korean firm Com2uS, it's got plenty to love for Western gamers as well as players in its home country.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-414998202\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376474486260/synapse.jpg\" alt=\"Frozen Synapse\" width=\"460\" height=\"270\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Frozen Synapse</figcaption></figure><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mode7games.frozensynapse\">Frozen Synapse (&pound;2.50)</a></h2><p>If you like a real challenge with your games, then Frozen Synapse is &pound;2.50 well spent this week. It's a turn-based strategy game originally released for computers, as you guide your squad through a succession of levels. 55 missions to play by yourself plus five multiplayer modes make this a treat.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirdsfriends\">Angry Birds Friends (Free)</a></h2><p>Angry Birds Friends isn't a new game, as such: it's been available to play on Facebook for some time. Both that and the mobile game give Angry Birds a social refit so that you're competing in weekly tournaments against your Facebook friends. Bragging and gifting is built in, as are in-app purchases.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.mightandmagic.clashofheroes\">Might &amp; Magic Clash of Heroes (&pound;2.99)</a></h2><p>This game may come from a well-established RPG game franchise, but its Clash of Heroes incarnation is a more modern beast: a puzzle-RPG. That means you'll be battling monsters and looting dungeons, but with the battles built around match-three puzzling. Publisher Ubisoft promises more than 20 hours in its campaign mode, plus multiplayer modes to challenge friends.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chuckschallenge.chucks3d\">Chuck's Challenge 3D (Free)</a></h2><p>Chuck's Challenge comes from the same brains that invented popular puzzler Chip's Challenge. That means 125 levels to find your way through, overcoming obstacles and solving puzzles as you go. The game also includes a level creator to make your own and share them with other players – or just browse and play what the community has been creating.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stainlessgames.D14\">Magic 2014 (Free)</a></h2><p>Trading card game Magic: The Gathering continues to have a large and devoted fanbase. They'll be the people excited about this latest digital version, updated for 2014 with new cards, opponents and campaign levels to test your skills. As a free download, the game comes with three decks with five unlockable cards each, but more decks, cards and content can be bought via in-app purchase.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamevil.plantswar.glo\">Plants War (Free)</a></h2><p>Finally, another engrossing game from South Korea, this time from publisher Gamevil. It's a game based around plants defending their forest home from invading beasts. Which might sound a bit like Plants vs Zombies, but instead this is a meaty real-time strategy game with depth in (again, sorry) spades.</p><p>Now it's your turn: Cross at your favourite games being left out, or want to explain why one or more of the ones included are essential downloads?

        "body":"<p>Broadband providers are being asked to create a database of customers illegally downloading music, films and books, which could be used to disconnect or prosecute persistent offenders.</p><p>Measures to combat digital piracy will be among the topics discussed at a Downing Street breakfast on 12 September, when record-label bosses and their trade association, the BPI, have been invited to meet David Cameron.</p><p>BT, Virgin Media, BSkyB and TalkTalk are being asked by music and film companies to sign up to a voluntary code for policing illegal downloading. Negotiations have been under way for months with the BPI and the British Video Association, whose members include the BBC and Hollywood studios.</p><p>Between November 2012 and January this year, 280m music tracks were digitally pirated in the UK, along with 52m television shows, 29m films, 18m ebooks and 7m computer software or games files.</p><p>The data, collected by the communications regulator Ofcom, suggests 18% of internet users aged 12 and over have recently pirated content, while just 9% fear getting caught. Last month, Breaking Bad was released to UK viewers on Netflix and iTunes within hours of its US airing in an apparent attempt to limit piracy.</p><p>Studios and music labels want action now because the Digital Economy Act, which was created to combat piracy, has yet to be implemented despite being voted into law by parliament in 2010. Delays mean the act will not come into force until 2014 at the earliest, and could be pushed back until after the general election in 2015.</p><p>A key part of any voluntary agreement is the creation of a database of repeat offenders. Initially, customers would receive letters from their broadband company saying their internet address had been used for illegal downloads.</p><p>The letters could warn of consequences and direct internet users to legal sites selling music, videos and books. Those who received three such letters could face sanctions.</p><p>Measures could include throttling internet connections to slow them down, blocking users from particular sites, disconnecting offenders from broadband for a limited period and ultimately prosecution. Broadband companies would need to keep a list of those customers they had sent letters to.</p><p>There are concerns that such a database may be illegal under the Data Protection Act, which states companies can only retain information about individuals where it is needed for commercial purposes.</p><p>Emma Hutchinson, a Virgin Media spokeswoman, said: \"Music and film companies are speaking to broadband providers about how to address illegal file-sharing but what they're currently proposing is unworkable.\"</p><p>In 2009 and 2010, Virgin Media voluntarily sent letters to customers who were reported by rights holders to be file sharing. However, the company did not keep a record of those who had received letters, or disclose their identity to any third parties.</p><p>A spokeswoman for TalkTalk said: \"We are involved in discussions about measures to address illegal file-sharing and ultimately would like to reach a voluntary agreement. However our customers' rights always come first and we would never agree to anything that could compromise them.\"</p><p>Talks with the prime minister next week will cover a range of ways to support the music industry, including encouraging legal digital music sales in the UK and abroad, according to a spokesman for the BPI. He added: \"The PM is a keen fan of British music and has invited some key industry figures to discuss how it can be further supported, both here and abroad... As concerns the Digital Economy Act, we will discuss with government the need for swifter action to reduce online copyright theft, improve consumer awareness of legal services and make the UK the leading digital economy in Europe.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said the government would not force broadband companies to adopt any fresh measures. She added: \"We are aware of industry discussions, and we would welcome a system that was effective and fair to consumers.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416275490|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|5c7d949d721bfe2ba04677a1d716039c026e5870 -->",

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>How Economic Inequality Harms Societies</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Professor Richard Wilkinson, an epidemiologist.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The effects of inequality on societies all over the world. This will be familiar territory to anyone who has read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/13/the-spirit-level\" title=\"\">The Spirit Level</a>, but for those who haven't it will be eye-opening in the extreme. Wilkinson shows that in unequal societies crime rates are higher, mental health and teen pregnancy are more common, and people – in every income bracket – live shorter lives.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Yes. It's kind of his life's work.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Wilkinson's brilliant voice.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Reinvigorate egalitarianism; reform everything.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Your Body Language  Shapes Who You Are</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Professor Amy JC Cuddy, of Harvard Business School.</p><p><strong>What is she on about?</strong> The power of a power stance. Cuddy argues that not only do our non-verbal communications govern how others think and feel about us, they also have a significant effect on how we feel about ourselves.</p><p><strong>Is she right?</strong> Yeah, it's kind of her area of expertise. Plus it's all backed up with the science of testosterone and cortisol levels.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Cuddy's personal story of faking it as a public speaker.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Stand tall; fake it; make it.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jackson_katz_violence_against_women_it_s_a_men_s_issue.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Violence Against Women –  it's a Men's Issue</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Dr Jackson Katz, an educator, filmmaker and cultural theorist.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The need to  focus on the men who commit violence against women – and how other men can stop them. Katz argues that male peer cultures need to change, and this requires brave leadership within male-dominated communities.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Yes, of course. The more sexist a man is the more likely it will be other men, not women, who change his mind.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> A well-deployed  Martin Luther King quote.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to: </strong>Challenge patriarchy;  embarrass sexists; berate your granddad.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Depression in the US</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Professor Robert  Sapolsky, of Stanford University.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> Depression. Specifically, major depression. Which he defines as \"a biochemical disorder with a genetic component, with early-experience influences, where somebody can't appreciate sunsets\". Sapolsky argues that it must be recognised as a disease as real as diabetes or cancer. And he says it is absurd and ignorant to suggest that people with severe depression simply need to \"pull themselves together\".</p><p><strong>Is he right? </strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Sapolsky's captivating beard.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Sympathise with sufferers; banish ignorance;  appreciate beards.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Listening to Shame</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Professor of social work Brené Brown.</p><p><strong>What is she on about?</strong> The power of shame. Brown's first talk for TED was on the power of vulnerability. It has been viewed over 10m times. In her second, she returns to her roots as a researcher into shame, which she argues \"is an epidemic in our culture\".</p><p><strong>Is she right?</strong> She is. The talk is light on evidence but rich with authority.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Her account of the effects of shame on health.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Dance like someone's watching; love like you'll be hurt; sing like everyone is listening.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F6J8o7AAe8\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Why I Am Not a Christian</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Nobel prize-winning philosopher, mathematician and campaigner Bertrand Russell. Back in 1927.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The flimsiness of the arguments for God's existence and the stifling effects of religious doctrine on human progress. Long before Richard Dawkins made militant atheism fashionable, Russell had already more or less settled the argument.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>\"A good world needs knowledge, kindliness, and courage; it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men.\"</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Argue with Christians; silence Dawkins fanboys; live.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/bryan_stevenson_we_need_to_talk_about_an_injustice.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>We Need to Talk About an Injustice</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking? </strong>Bryan Stevenson, a public interest lawyer and the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative.</p><p><strong>What is he on about? </strong>The need for drastic reform to the American criminal justice system.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> The facts are hard to argue with. For example: America has the highest rate of incarceration in the world, with 2.3 million people in prison, and one in three black men in America aged 18 to 30 is in prison or on probation or parole.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>\"The moral arc of this universe is long but it bends towards justice.\"</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to: </strong>Change the world; chastise Americans; check your privilege.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMj_P_6H69g\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>The Art of Asking</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Singer, songwriter and musician Amanda Palmer.</p><p><strong>What is she on about? </strong>The willingness of fans to pay for music if you ask them to do so. She suggests the music industry shouldn't ask: \"How do we make people pay for music?\" but instead \"How do we let people pay for music?\"</p><p><strong>Is she right?</strong> Well, it worked for her. The talk is mostly about Palmer's own success with crowdfunding.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>The moment the audience realises just how successful her fan-funded approach has been.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Bypass record labels; make great art; crowdsource your mortgage.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/lz_granderson_the_myth_of_the_gay_agenda.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>The Myth of the Gay Agenda</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Sports journalist and gay rights activist LZ Granderson.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The ludicrous notion that there is a \"gay lifestyle\", let alone a \"gay agenda\". Granderson argues the entire gay agenda is there in the US constitution: the demand to be treated as equal citizens. He also points out that in some US states a landlord can evict their tenants – and a boss can fire their employees – for being gay.</p><p><strong>Is he right? </strong>Obviously.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>The bit where he has a lightsaber.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Get mad; get equal.<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/kent_larson_brilliant_designs_to_fit_more_people_in_every_city.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Brilliant Designs to Fit More People in Every City</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Architect and designer Kent Larson.</p><p><strong>What is he on about? </strong>The need for the cities of the future to make more efficient use of space. He calls it \"a global imperative\".</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Yes. It's a pretty uncontroversial thesis. But Larson's talk goes further and shows off some of the technology that might address the problem.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>That cool new tech: a folding car designed for shared use; an electronic three-wheeled bike; and a two-room apartment that functions like a five-bed town house using transformable multipurpose furniture.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to: </strong>Prepare for the future; feel better about your tiny flat.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90b1MBwnEHM\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Shaking Hands With Death</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Discworld author Sir Terry Pratchett, via actor Tony Robinson.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The right to die on one's own terms. Pratchett's moving speech addresses the arguments against assisted dying one by one, subjecting each to a sharp satirical examination.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> As Pratchett puts it: \"I believe that consensual assisted death for those that ask for it is quite hard to oppose.\" After watching this, it's even harder.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Too many moments of humour and heartbreak to pick one.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Fall in love with Pratchett; prepare to die.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syjEN3peCJw&amp;feature=youtube_gdata\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>The Voices in My Head</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Academic Eleanor Longden.</p><p><strong>What is she on about?</strong> Her experience of hearing voices. Longden was diagnosed with schizophrenia and told by doctors she would never recover. She proved them wrong with the help of the Hearing Voices Network, which encouraged her to engage in dialogue with her voices to discover and address the underlying problems from her past. She argues for a radical shift in attitudes towards people who hear voices.</p><p><strong>Is she right? </strong>It worked for her. And many others.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Finding out just how far she has come since.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Improve treatment; be compassionate; challenge ignorance about mental health.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umFnrvcS6AQ\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Arithmetic, Population and Energy: Sustainability 101</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking? </strong>Physics professor Albert A Bartlett.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The same thing he's been on about since he first gave this infamous lecture in 1969: the inevitability of overpopulation; its disastrous consequences in a world of finite resources; and the fact that the US is the prime culprit in terms of per capita resource use.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Yeah. Although he doesn't really offer a solution.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>The sheer weight of intellect and evidence marshalled.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to: </strong>Reconsider progress; check your consumption; become a nihilist.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking? </strong>Harvard law professor and US senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p><strong>What is she on about? </strong>The precarious way of life of the modern two-income family in America. She argues that in the space of a single generation the middle class have lost the financial capacity to survive income shocks. And, as a result, America is transitioning from a three-class society to a two-class society: the rich, and the debt-ridden rest.</p><p><strong>Is she right?</strong> We'll see. But the stats are pretty convincing.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> All those shocking stats.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Demand change; get rich; die tryin'.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=eJybVxUiy2U\"\"></p><h2><strong>The Secret Powers of Time </strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Professor Philip Zimbardo.</p><p><strong>What is he on about? </strong>The way our personal, national and cultural concepts of time affect our health, well-being and careers. Zimbardo divides people into six groups according to their perspectives on time: the past-negative; past-positive; present-hedonistic; present-fated; future-oriented with a focus on work; and future-oriented with a focus on the afterlife. He says many of life's problems can be solved by understanding our time perspectives.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Maybe. But re-conceptualising time seems less about solving problems than realising how little they matter.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> This short RSA Animate version – for people with less time.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Slow down; chill out; save time.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/esther_perel_the_secret_to_desire_in_a_long_term_relationship.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>The Secret to Desire in a Long-Term Relationship</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Psychotherapist and marriage coach Esther Perel.</p><p><strong>What is she on about?</strong> The tension between desire and domestic life. She argues that erotic desire is not about toys, lingerie or Hollywood-derived spontaneity, but the freedom to keep exploring life away from your partner.</p><p><strong>Is she right?</strong> You would have to ask the couples she works with.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Her thesis that \"the erotic mind is not very politically correct\" because \"most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things we protest about during the day\".</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Stop stifling your partner; keep things spicy; get turned on by benefit cuts.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/anthony_atala_printing_a_human_kidney.html\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Printing a Human Kidney</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Anthony Atala, a surgeon and director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The capacity of 3D-printing technology to one day solve the organ-donor problem by printing a human kidney one layer of cells at a time.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Well, he brings a prototype printed kidney out on stage, so he must be making some progress.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>A moving cameo from a boy with an artificial bladder.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Save lives; prepare for the future; fax people kidneys as a joke.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Do Schools Kill Creativity?</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Educationalist, author, academic and government advisor Sir Kenneth Robinson.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The need to reform education. Robinson says schools are teaching children not to be creative and failing to recognise the diversity of intelligence. He calls for a rethink of the fundamental principles of education, placing creativity front and centre.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Perhaps. He's certainly popular. With over 23m views, Robinson's 20-minute lecture is the most-watched TED talk so far.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Robinson's killer gags. It's almost a stand-up routine.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Reform education; help your children; annoy teachers.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Sugar: the Bitter Truth</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking? </strong>Professor of clinical pediatrics Robert H Lustig.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The high fructose diet. Lustig says fructose – the sweet molecule in added sugar – is the primary cause of the obesity pandemic. He calls it \"a poison\".</p><p><strong>Is he right? </strong>The science is debated, but there are enormous vested interests behind high-fructose foods; you would expect there to be a lot of disagreement even if Lustig is entirely correct.</p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> At an hour and a half, the bit where it finally ends. But – if you're not familiar with this stuff already – it's well worth it.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Cut your sugar; cut your kids' sugar; hate juice.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcJxRqTs5nk\" title=\"\"></p><h2><strong>Moral Behaviour in Animals</strong></h2><p></a></p><p><strong>Who's talking?</strong> Professor Frans de Waal, a primatologist.</p><p><strong>What is he on about?</strong> The capacity of animals to cooperate and empathise with one another, as demonstrated by chimps, elephants and capuchin monkeys. De Waal argues that this capacity in animals suggests morality has pre-human evolutionary roots.</p><p><strong>Is he right?</strong> Perhaps, although the explanation may have more to do with survival than any meaningful notion of altruism.</p><p><strong>Highlight: </strong>The Capuchin monkeys rejecting unequal pay.</p><p><strong>Use this knowledge to:</strong> Demand income equality for monkeys.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/415924643|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|dfcf2845ac34f66bc338900b0ff733ff6ce702f7 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>Age:</strong> 27.</p><p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Constantly obscured by a hideous-looking pair of futuristic  cyberglasses.</p><p><strong>Is she an inventor? Or from the future? No wait – she's a cyborg!</strong> Not quite. She's the Google Glass marketing manager.</p><p><strong>Oh.</strong> And reportedly, Sergey Brin's new girlfriend.</p><p><strong><em>Oh.</em></strong> <strong>Sergey Brin the co-founder of Google? Lucky her. I wonder what she could have possibly seen in the multi-billionaire techno-omnilord.</strong> You're being very cynical today. By all accounts, Rosenberg seems like a pretty interesting person.</p><p><strong>Really?</strong> Well, she was born in Hong Kong,  moved to Britain and was educated at the  same school as Kate Middleton and Princess Beatrice ...</p><p><strong>Hmm …</strong> Then she upped and moved to San Francisco all by herself, which demonstrates considerable bravery. Most importantly, she seems to have a good sense of humour. Or at least, <a href=\"http://thehairpin.com/2012/03/the-10-least-inspiring-sentences-on-this-lululemon-tote\" title=\"\">she once openly mocked a bag for  having \"LOVE\" written on it</a> which, admit it,  is quite endearing.</p><p><strong>Ah, she has an online presence. How does she describe herself? </strong>The word \"misanthrope\" comes up quite a lot. As does \"Chew\" – Chinese Jew – which was apparently used in her Google+ profile at some point, before it was replaced with a giant photo of her <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/app/basic/108933734205917047590/about?cbp=1qibarn5ddtqp&amp;sview=27\" title=\"\">wearing a pair of Google Glass spectacles</a>.</p><p><strong>She's got a Google+ page too? No wonder she's a misanthrope. </strong>Steady on. She is going out with a billionaire, after all.</p><p><strong>A married billionaire with two kids, to be  fair. </strong>Yes, there is that. Although Brin and his  wife have reportedly been living apart for a number of months, so there's no suggestion  that she's directly responsible for any sort  of breakup.</p><p><strong>Well then. She's happy. He's happy. His wife  will presumably get some sort of colossal  payoff. Everyone's happy.</strong> She does still have  to wear those horrible glasses every day,  though.</p><p><strong>Yeah, that sucks. </strong>I know. It must be like having a Segway stuck to your face.</p><p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"OK, Glass.\"</p><p><strong>Don't say:</strong> \"Can I take these off now, Sergey?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416167636|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|dfba89fa0c50e84e03f32747dc949228c141a627 -->",

While it's free to download, it does need a year's subscription for £54.99 per computer once the 14-day trial runs out.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/explore-shakespeare/id608993627?mt=8\">Explore Shakespeare (Free)</a></h2><p>Shakespeare goes freemium! Although thankfully not in the 'in-app purchases to unlock dragons in Hamlet' sense. This is an app to access Cambridge University Press' individual versions of plays including Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Twelfth Night and A Midsummer Night's Dream, with lots of innovative AND useful features to dig deeper into the texts. Each play costs £9.99.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-mindstorms-robot-commander/id681786521?mt=8\">Lego Mindstorms Robot Commander (Free)</a></h2><p>Lego has actually released three apps for its new Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit this week. Robot Commander is the one you use to control the five robots that can be built using the kit: walking, slithering, grasping, and then making you a cup of tea (I'm guessing with that last one: don't be disappointed). Also worth checking out: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-mindstorms-3d-builder/id679003776?mt=8\">Lego Mindstorms 3D Builder</a>, which teaches you how to build the bots, and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-mindstorms-fix-factory/id671493323?mt=8\">Lego Mindstorms Fix the Factory</a>, a puzzle game introducing one of them.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/madden-nfl-25-by-ea-sports/id657626045?mt=8\">Madden NFL 25 (Free)</a></h2><p>EA's moves to make some of its biggest game franchises freemium continues with Madden NFL the latest to get the treatment. Yes, there's American Football action here, but the focus is just as much on building a team of players through (digital) card-collecting, with in-app purchases funding your roster ambitions.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/material-blogs-news-rss-tailored/id673115871?mt=8\">Material (Free)</a></h2><p>The latest company aiming to provide a sleek news-aggregation app is INQ, with this port of the Material app that's been going down well on Android. Promising \"fresh new content you'll love based on what you already like\", it gets you to sign in with Twitter or Facebook, then analyses your posts to figure out what you might want to read about.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/monster-match-puzzle-adventure/id618279488?mt=8\">Monster Match (Free)</a></h2><p>Monster Match got me hooked on holiday last week with its combination of match-three puzzling and Pokemon-style monster-collecting. It sees you finding and battling more than 225 beasties by matching gems, with plenty of nuances in balancing the various abilities and levelling up. The inspiration is fairly clear: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/may/14/puzzle-and-dragons-gungho-revenues\">Puzzle &amp; Dragons</a>, currently one of the most lucrative mobile games in the world. But you can't yet play that here in the UK, so Monster Match is worth a look.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bittorrent-sync/id665156116?mt=8\">BitTorrent Sync (Free)</a></h2><p>No, not an actual BitTorrent filesharing client – Apple still doesn't allow those on the App Store. This is from BitTorrent the company – a file-syncing application tying into the wider BitTorrent Sync service, so you can access your folders and files on the go, and send photos and videos to those folders as well.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fleep/id678917069?mt=8\">Fleep (Free)</a></h2><p>As explained last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/aug/29/fleep-email-messaging-app\">Fleep is the new thing from two of Skype's founding engineers</a>: an app that sits somewhere between chat and email. It supports one-to-one and group chats, saving important messages to a Pinboard, and making shared photos and documents easily accessible.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/quip/id647922896?mt=8\">Quip (Free)</a></h2><p>Quip is a much-talked-about new word processing app that – from this week – is available in the UK as well as the US. The schtick: it groups documents and messages about them in a chat-like \"thread of updates\", making collaboration clearer. It works across Android, iOS and desktop computers too.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flick-kick-field-goal-2014/id646568481?mt=8\">Flick Kick Field Goal 2014 (Free)</a></h2><p>I've had to uninstall the Flick Kick Football game several times after it got in the way of work, and developer PikPok has a good record with making other sports just as addictive too. This new Flick Kick Field Goal game focuses on American Football kicking, as you flick your balls (so to speak) to get as high a score as possible.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/inplayrs/id692721833?mt=8\">Inplayrs (Free)</a></h2><p>Inplayrs is worth keeping an eye on for sports fans: an app that gets you to compete with other players to predict outcomes as matches play, with live odds and data fed in all the time. It's the work of a team of ex Betfair, Morgan Stanley and Amazon folk, with sports covered including football, tennis, basketball and cricket.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/syllable/id687795555?mt=8\">Syllable (£0.69)</a></h2><p>Here's an interesting idea: an app that promises to help you \"earn to read much faster, and helps you finish your Instapaper and Pocket articles you've been meaning to get to\". So it ties into those services, while teaching you how to minimise \"subvocalisation\" (the process of saying – in your head – the words you read), thus speeding you up. Intriguing.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pixaki-pixel-art-for-professionals/id689084217?mt=8\">Pixaki: Pixel Art for Professionals (£4.99)</a></h2><p>Pixel art – as seen in around 52% of critically-acclaimed iOS games in recent memory (rough estimate) – continues to be popular with game designers. What if you're doing it yourself, though? Pixaki aims to help you create \"anything from retro game characters to vast isometric cityscapes\" with intuitive touchscreen controls and clever upscaling tech for usage elsewhere.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tablepouncer-last-minute-dining/id689979016?mt=8\">TablePouncer (Free)</a></h2><p>Looking to bag a cheap meal at a decent restaurant? TablePouncer is aiming to satisfy your appetite for bargain grub. It rounds up deals for more than 500 restaurants in a selection of British cities including London, Brighton, Southampton, Bournemouth, Bristol and Bath (presumably it'll head north of the Watford Gap soon too, or at least you'd hope so).<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lucy-ladybird/id690850257?mt=8\">Lucy Ladybird (£3.99)</a></h2><p>Not enough children's apps have proper theme songs. Lucy Ladybird does, and with it comes a well-crafted story of the heroine's search for her spots. Digital colouring, karaoke and a spider-hunting mini-game are also included, with more materials available on its website for parents and children to enjoy together.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marc-masterpieces-architecture/id684253307?mt=8\">marc - Masterpieces of Architecture (Free)</a></h2><p>Something for travellers here: an app that promises \"the top 25 masterpieces of Budapest\" – as in buildings – with more cities to follow in subsequent updates. Expect photos, drawings, tours and location features showing you how to get to each building. Architectural tourists will love it.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/habitrpg/id689569235?mt=8\">HabitRPG (Free)</a></h2><p>A fun attempt to blend roleplaying game mechanics with a productivity app. Or, as the App Store listing puts it: \"Habit tracking which treats your goals like a Role Playing Game. Level up as you succeed, lose HP as you fail, earn money to buy weapons and armor.\" It's the official spin-off from the HabitRPG website, used to motivate everything from calling your mum to working out.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/national-trust-postcards/id692743720?mt=8\">National Trust Postcards (Free)</a></h2><p>There are a number of apps that turn your iPhone photos into physical postcards, but how many of them actually benefit the places you're snapping pics of? This one does: it's an official app from the National Trust, charging £1.50 per postcard.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wungi-pirates/id682387345?mt=8\">Wungi Pirates (£1.99)</a></h2><p>This attempt to create a \"sandbox\" style game for children is worth watching as more content is added in the weeks to come: it's a piratical game that currently features sailing, cannon battles, treasure-hunting and parrots. Well, there'd have to be parrots. It's playful and open-ended in its scope.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/junk-jack-x/id601584735?mt=8\">Junk Jack X (£2.99)</a></h2><p>Junk Jack was one of my favourites in the emerging genre of \"inspired by Minecraft but in 2D\" games on iOS, but now it has a sequel. It sees you exploring randomly-generated worlds full of monsters, loot and items to craft with. There's lots to see and do: and online and local multiplayer to share the fun with others.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><p>That's this week's selection, but what do you think?

        "headline":"Nintendo 2DS: is this the end of 3D gaming?",
        "body":"<p>Responses have been mixed to say the very least. TechCrunch called it &quot;hideous&quot;, Wired went for &quot;weird&quot;, but NIntendo is hoping the new 2DS handheld console will work alongside the Wii U price cut to boost sales in the crucial Christmas season.</p><p></p><p>For those who missed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/28/nintendo-wiiu-price-drop-2ds\" title=\"\">the news yesterday</a>, the 2DS is a cheaper version of the controversial 3DS handheld, launched back in 2011. Set for release on 12 October in Europe, the new machine features the same internal hardware as the 3DS, but with no stereoscopic 3D functionality, and with a new slate design replacing the hinged &quot;clam shell&quot; configuration that has characterised the DS range. The twin displays will have the same sizes as the original 3DS screens (3.5 inches for the top display, 3 inches for the lower), and the dual camera lenses on the backside have been retained – so strangely, it'll take stereoscopic photos, but you'll need to transfer them to a 3DS to view them in full.</p><p></p><p>Wireless internet connection has also been maintained, allowing the popular StreetPass and SpotPass social connectivity features to be maintained. The machine will be available in red and white or black and blue colour schemes and is expected to retail at &pound;110, &pound;30 to &pound;35 less than the cheapest 3DS offers.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/08/nintendo-2ds/\" title=\"\">Speaking to US gaming site Kotaku on Wednesday</a>, the Nintendo of America president, Reggie Fils-Aime, described the console as &quot;an entry-level handheld gaming system&quot;, opening up the technology to cash-strapped families this Christmas. But many sites have read the move as an acceptance that the 3D gaming experiment has been a disappointing mis-step. Since its launch two-and-a-half years ago, the 3DS has shifted about 33m units, but the original DS machine had sold more than 45m units within the same amount of time. During the launch period of the machine, many newspapers <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3499049/Nintendo-3DS-makes-gamers-dizzy-sick.html\" title=\"\">including the Sun</a> alleged that the stereoscopic screens were causing nausea for a large number of gamers, while Nintendo itself issued a health warning advising against the viewing of stereoscopic effects for children under seven. These elements, together with the comparatively high launch price, acted as a deterrent to the sort of family-focused purchasers who helped make the DS such a huge success.</p><p></p><p>The move comes at a time in which enthusiasm for home 3D technology is waining. Although sales of 3D television sets grew by more than 70% in 2012 according to industry research specialist DisplaySearch, it seems as though consumers are not making use of the functionality after purchase. In July, the BBC revealed that its 3D programming would be put on indefinite hold, while ESPN is shutting down its 3D content by the end of 2013. Both have cited lack of public interest as their motivation. Furthermore, although a range of Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 games were released with stereoscopic modes during the major hype period of 3D TV sales, very few developers are now supporting the technology. Gamer apathy and disappointing results have been the key explanations.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile in the games industry, Nintendo is losing ground to its rivals Sony and Microsoft who both have new next-gen machines out in November. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are much more powerful than the Wii U and their head-to-head hype war has led to impressive pre-orders for both contenders, leaving Wii U and 3DS in the shade. At the same time, Nintendo's handheld console is having to complete against smartphones and tablets as well as the PlayStation Vita, a more advanced handheld gaming device that may well receive a boost thanks to its close compatibility with the PS4.</p><p></p><p>Analysts understand Nintendo's thinking, but responses have been as mixed as the game sites. &quot;The launch of the 2DS makes sense,&quot; said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS Electronics and Media. &quot;Unlike Sony with its PS Vita, this younger consumer is Nintendo's core user for its handhelds, and the 3DS, while performing better since 2012, is still relatively expensive and also able to display 3D, which carries a warning for younger children. Launching a cheaper, non-3D, non-hinged product plugs the gap left in Nintendo's portfolio created by the decline of its original DS platform.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Brian Blau, a research director at Gartner, understands the strategy, but feels its more about treading water rather than boosting competitiveness in the market. &quot;While the 3D part of the 3DS was interesting there was some concern about the screen and the 3D content,&quot; he said. &quot;It's possible that removing these components was enough of a cost saving but didn't take away from the overall 3DS experience or sacrifice the core game and app capability. I don't believe this new device (or the price cuts on Wii U) will have that much impact on their overall performance in the market, but it could help them keep the units moving and games being played.&quot;</p><p></p><p>There will also be questions regarding the admittedly small selection of 3DS titles that really <em>utilise</em> the stereoscopic features. What sort of experience will 2DS owners get from games like Super Mario 3D World and Pilot Wings Resort that make 3D visuals a key part of the navigation and gameplay?</p><p></p><p>While the Nintendo 3DS is certainly not in the same league of three-dimensional failure as the infamous Virtual Boy device, which was launched in 1995 to near universal criticism, the arrival of the 2DS suggests the manufacturer's confidence in its gadget has taken a hit.

        "headline":"Phablets are big in Asia-Pacific, equalling tablets and laptops combined",
        "body":"<p>\"Phablets\", the large-screened phones with screen sizes of between 5in and 7in diagonally, sold as well as tablets and laptops combined in the Asia-Pacific region during the second quarter, says research company IDC.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prSG24296513\">news</a> indicates that the smartphone business has created a new category lying between the standard smartphone and the tablet, first mapped out by Dell with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Streak\">Streak</a> phone in June 2010, but subsequently capitalised on by Samsung with its Galaxy Note and successors.</p><p>A total of 25.2m \"phablets\" shipped in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), compared to 12.6m tablets (over 7in) and 12.7m portable PCs, IDC said.</p><p>Phablet shipments have grown dramatically - doubling between the first and second quarter, and rising sixfold compared to the same time last year.</p><p>However Samsung's principal rival in the smartphone space, Apple, is unlikely to be able to capitalise on the popularity of phablets this year. Its new iPhones, expected to be unveiled this month, will be using the same 4in screen seen in last year's iPhone 5, according to leaks from the supply chain over the past few months. That suggests that it would not be able to introduce a \"phablet\"-style device before 2014 - even if it wants to.</p><p>Analysts had foreseen the potential for 2013 to be \"the year of the phablet\" in January, after noting the rapid rise of the large-screened phones in 2012. That month saw China's Huawei and ZTE both launch their own versions at the Consumer Electronics Show. Taiwan's HTC has also followed with its own \"Butterfly\" model.</p><p>Samsung more recently staked out the top end of the phablet space with its 6.3in Galaxy Mega, unveiled in April.</p><p>\"Users have realised that a nearly 5-inch screen isn't such a cumbersome device,\" said Joshua Flood of ABI Research in January, and forecast then that countries such as Japan and South Korea, and then India, China and Malaysia, would be major markets for the larger devices.</p><p>Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics was more straightforward: \"We expect 2013 to be the year of the phablet,\" he said in January.</p><p>Flood's forecast has been borne out, with phablets accounting for 30% of all smartphone sales in India.</p><p>The key beneficiary is Samsung, whose Galaxy Note range - due to be enhanced this week with the Note 3 on Wednesday - had nearly 50% of the market.</p><p>But it has had to fight off rivals which have jumped onto the bandwagon. At its launch at the end of 2011, the Note had 90% of the much smaller phablet space. </p><p>Their <a href=\"http://www.icharts.net/chartchannel/apej-portable-pc-tablet-and-phablet-shipments-2011-q4-2013-q2_m33rycjbc\">popularity</a> points to a regional preference for larger screens which can be used to carry out work on the go, rather than separate functions to a smaller smartphone and larger tablet.</p><p>The Asia/Pacific region, and especially China, are seen as a key battleground for the smartphone business as western markets such as North America and Europe move past the early burst of adoption, and sales growth there slows down. By contrast countries such as China, India and others are seeing rapid uptake.</p><p>\"Phablets first started as a trend driven by mature markets like South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore – and these markets continue to rise,\" said Melissa Chau, senior research manager for IDC's Asia/Pacific client device team. \"What's changed now is the added pick up of phablets in emerging markets like China and India, not just the plethora of big-name vendors competing head-to-head with Samsung, but instead the low-cost local players who have swooped in to offer big screens for less money – averaging a retail price of US$220 versus Samsung's US$557.\" </p><p>Dell lost out by being too early to the market with the Streak, introducing it at a time when most users had smaller phones with screens under 4in diagonally. But the rise in smartphone penetration, and the shift to more data-centric uses such as maps, has made big screens popular - particularly in countries where the device needs to serve multiple computing needs.</p><p>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416302289|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|07112ea1e45bccc5df2361e545eeb360381fb8a6 -->",

        "headline":"20 best Android apps this week",
        "body":"<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for Android smartphones and tablets.</p><p>It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. The equivalent iOS roundup will be published later in the day.</p><p>For now, read on for this week's Android selection (and when you've finished, check out previous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/best-android-apps\">Best Android apps</a> posts).</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diggreader\">Digg (Free)</a></h2><p>Web 2.0 veteran Digg has been reinvented in recent times, promising to serve up \"the most interesting and talked-about stories on the Internet\", from blog posts to videos and social networking updates. Its app is one of a number jostling for position as replacements for Google Reader, enabling you to hoover up RSS feeds and share stories to social networks.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojotouch.simon\">Simon The Sorcerer (£2.70)</a></h2><p>A generation of gamers has fond memories of adventure game Simon the Sorcerer, which first came out 20 years ago. Now it's been revived for modern-day Android devices, with controls tweaked for touchscreens. As before, it sees novice pointyhat Simon dealing with \"goblins, dwarves, swamplings, stupid wizards and sleeping giants\".</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.repix.android&amp;hl=en\">Repix (Free)</a></h2><p>Another photo-sharing app? Well, this is more about photo-editing: the emphasis with Repix is on what you do to your photos before sharing them to various social services. Filters, yes, but also \"handcrafted effect brushes\" to touch up your shots with more than 30 effects, and simple cropping and adjustments tools.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobage.ww.a1431.Puzzles_Android\">Monster Match (Free)</a></h2><p>Monster Match got me hooked on holiday last week with its combination of match-three puzzling and Pokemon-style monster-collecting. It sees you finding and battling more than 225 beasties by matching gems, with plenty of nuances in balancing the various abilities and levelling up. The inspiration is fairly clear: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.gungho.padEN&amp;hl=en_GB\">Puzzle &amp; Dragons</a>, currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/may/14/puzzle-and-dragons-gungho-revenues\">one of the most lucrative mobile games in the world</a>. But you can't yet play that here in the UK, so Monster Match is worth a look.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.mindstorms.robotcommander\">Lego Mindstorms Commander (Free)</a></h2><p>Parents! If you've got £299.99 spare for the new Lego Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit for your children (or, indeed, for yourself) you'll be wanting to get the companion Commander app too. It's used as a touchscreen controller for the various robots (Ev3rstorm, R3ptar, Track3r, Spik3r and Gripp3r) that you can build from the kit, including the ability to create your own commands.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.activision.skylanders.cloudpatrol\">Skylanders Cloud Patrol (£1.28)</a></h2><p>And in more parental-spending-warning news, here's the latest Skylanders game from Activision: a shooty action game that gets kids to blast troll characters and string combos together to boost their score as high as possible. As on other Skylanders games, children can also scan in the physical toys to play with them in the game.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crescentmoongames.siegecraftdefender\">Siegecraft Defender (£1.92)</a></h2><p>Your Android device is surrounded by an army of tower defence games, edging in from every angle. Apt, really. Siegecraft Defender is the latest, from developer Crescent Moon Games, and it's very good indeed as lizardmen battle knights in the world of the Siegecraft games. Impressive graphics and plenty of depth help this stand out from the hordes of rivals.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.duplo.trains\">Lego Duplo Train (Free)</a></h2><p>More Lego, but this time it's the company's toddler brand Duplo providing the entertainment. Aimed at two year-olds, it's a colourful train-based game where they build their own trains, bridges and then drive around them.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikpok.fkfg2.play\">Flick Kick Field Goal 2014 (Free)</a></h2><p>I've had to uninstall the Flick Kick Football game several times after it got in the way of work, and developer PikPok has a good record with making other sports just as addictive too. This new Flick Kick Field Goal game focuses on American Football kicking, as you flick your balls (so to speak) to get as high a score as possible.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fld.DarkNebula.EP2\">Dark Nebula HD - Episode Two (Free)</a></h2><p>It's another good week for Android games, with this a sequel to developer Free Lunch Design's first episode of Dark Nebula HD. It's a ball-based puzzler where you tilt to move through 19 levels, with lots of obstacles and enemies trying to impede your progress.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quip.quip\">Quip (Free)</a></h2><p>Quip is a much-talked-about new word processing app for Android that – from this week – is available in the UK as well as the US. The schtick: it groups documents and messages about them in a chat-like \"thread of updates\", making collaboration clearer. It works across Android, iOS and desktop computers too.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.mindstorms.dddbuilder\">Lego Mindstorms 3D Builder (Free)</a></h2><p>The second of three Lego Mindstorms EV3 apps out this week alongside the kit itself: this is the instructions for actually building the five robots, with zoomable and rotatable 3D diagrams of every step in the process. Essentially it's a replacement for traditional printed instructions, to (hopefully) reduce your swearing as you build the bots for/with an expectant child.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cipherprime.pulse\">Pulse (£2)</a></h2><p>Pulse was excellent when it came out on iOS a while back, and looks just as impressive on Android. It's a musical game where \"players become part conductor, part note-captor, part multi-touch master\", tapping notes as they move around the circular environment. Hypnotic and rather marvellous.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.cw.olliethecat\">Ollie the Cat (Free)</a></h2><p>More fun for pre-school children here with Ollie, a cat who wants to help children learn to count by spotting animals in his garden. Narrated by a seven year-old – something that I've seen generally appeals to younger children – its illustrations have plenty of character. Soon, it'll get an extra Ollie's Colours story (bought via in-app purchase) to do the same thing for colours.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LockedDoorPuzzle.KairoMobile\">Kairo (£3.15)</a></h2><p>More exploration and puzzle-solving here: Kairo sees you wending your way through \"vast abandoned monuments\" figuring out what's going on and why you're there. It's big on atmosphere rather than whiz-bang action, and all the better for it.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.mindstorms.fixthefactory\">Lego Mindstorms Fix Factory (Free)</a></h2><p>One last Lego Mindstorms app this week: this doesn't work with the real robotics kit, but is rather a puzzle game starring one of them, Ev3rstorm. It sees him exploring a factory looking for lost battery packs: a simple but fun-looking introduction to the new range.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.upnpcast\">Cast To UPnP/DLNA for GMusic (Free)</a></h2><p>Google's new Chromecast dongle, Apple's AirPlay and other technology means slinging media from smartphones to other household devices is front of mind this year. Here's an app for streaming music from the Google Play service – including cloud lockers and the All Access subscription service – to devices that support UPnP/DLNA connectivity. In other words, Chromecast-like abilities for devices that can't be used with Chromecast.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotemu.thelastexpress\">The Last Express (£3)</a></h2><p>Jordan Mechner is probably best known as the creator of Prince of Persia, but this is another of his games reworked for Android devices. Originally released in 1997 for PCs: an adventure on the Orient Express with a \"maelstrom of treachery, romance, and international intrigue\".</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.animocacollective.google.catdefense\">Cats vs Dragons (Free)</a></h2><p>Not, as such, a fair fight. Or is it? Cats vs Dragons is an RPG-strategy game where the cats punch (claw?) above their wright, battling through a succession of towers duffing up dragons, looting Cat Coins and levelling up. It looks pretty fun, with in-app purchases used to boost your chances.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.clipless\">Clipless (Free)</a></h2><p>Although more focused on the US and Canada, Clipless is available here in the UK too. It's a \"contextual deal locator\" that aims to ping you when there's a discount available at a business near your current location, hoovering up information from more than 2,000 separate discount sites.</p><p>That's this week's selection, but what do you think?

        "headline":"Apple plans new iPhone launch for 10 September, say reports",
        "body":"<p>Apple is thought to be planning the release of two new phones on 10 September, including a much-anticipated cheaper iPhone, dubbed the iPhone 5C.</p><p>As well as an incremental update to the current iPhone 5, expected to include fingerprint-detecting technology, the iPhone 5C would be Apple's first lower-end phone. Historically, Apple has fulfilled the needs of the low-end market by offering previous years' models at cut-down prices.</p><p>Industry suppliers have been told to expect the new device in mid-September, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130810/circle-sept-10-on-your-calendar-for-apples-big-iphone-event/\" title=\"\">but a leak to news site All Things D</a> claimed the launch is set for 10 September.</p><p>At a <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/1566012-apple-inc-aapl-ceo-discusses-f3q-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"\">recent earnings call</a>, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook reiterated that plan to investors. When asked about the potential of a low-cost iPhone to first time smartphone buyers, he replied that the number attracted by the iPhone 4 was \"very, very impressive. We want to attract as many of these buyers as we can\".</p><p>He added that \"where iPhone 5 continues to be the most popular iPhone by far, we are really happy to provide an incredible high-quality product with iPhone 4 running iOS 6 to as many first-time smartphone buyers as we can.\"</p><p>However, there have long been hints that the company was considering going in a different route, perhaps modelled on the iPod product line. <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/1129431-apples-ceo-discusses-f1q-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"\">During an earlier call in January of this year</a>, Cook pointed to the line as the model of how it thought about low-cost devices, saying: \"I think we've had a great track record here on iPod, doing different products at different price points and getting a reasonable share from doing that.\"</p><p>Each tier of iPod is a very different product from the others, to the extent that the iPod Shuffle and iPod Touch have barely anything in common.</p><p>Apple may have switched gears due to a weakness in Chinese sales, or a move to unify the shape of the iPhone line. In July, Cook discussed the slowdown in China, but argued that it was \"continuing to invest in distribution, we're going to double the number of retail stores there for the next two years and we're continuing to lift iPhone point of sales and iPad sales, both of which are currently lower than where we would want them or need them today\".</p><p>Additionally, there is a renewed impetus to unify the product line around the iPhone 5's 16:9 screen, the biggest change in form factor since the original iPhone in 2007.</p><p><a href=\"http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2013/8/7/notes-on-a-cheap-iphone\" title=\"\">Technology analyst Benedict Evans of Enders Analysis argues</a> that although \"a cheaper iPhone has been discussed almost since the original launch in 2007\", costs have fallen and the market developed \"to the point that it now makes sense for Apple to offer a $200-$300 [unsubsidised] model\".</p><p>That change boils down to three things: for the first time, Apple could make such a phone (which would be $100 cheaper than an iPhone 4) without having to compromise its sense of design; the fact that the low end of the market in major territories is now big enough to take notice of; and the need for the company to have a critical mass of users to ensure that programmers still think of developing for iOS before competing platforms.</p><p>As with the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4S, few extra features are expected for the new top-end iPhone. Instead, a speed boost and improved camera will likely be paired with exclusive software features. The major exception is the possibility of a fingerprint sensor mounted in the home button of the phone. Apple acquired fingerprint security firm AuthenTec last year, and the initial beta of iOS 7 contained settings for a sensor.</p><p>When asked for comment, Apple reiterated that it \"has not announced a press conference\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414846150|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|5eef20ee5c9ba6fa50b72ae12e6e2bf92b1c0cbd -->",

        "body":"<p>Oh SpongeBob. The memory of seeing my sons' favourite square-panted cartoon character putting his name to a mobile game selling Jellyfish Jelly in-app purchases for up to &pound;69.99 still makes me sad.</p><p>Nickelodeon is far from the only big brand pushing the upper limits of IAP in its children's apps though, as that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/gallery/2013/jun/07/kids-apps-in-app-purchases\">10 mobile games for kids with &pound;69.99 in-app purchase options</a> feature pointed out.</p><p>My Little Pony, Skylanders, Snoopy, Hello Kitty, Stardoll… it was a dispiriting gallery of greed. What's been bothering me since writing that article, though, is concern that it may have persuaded some parents that all children's apps are like that.</p><p>They're not. There are accessible education apps, beautiful storybooks, wonderful creative apps and playful digital toys to be found on smartphones and parents. Some of them use IAP in an ethical way too: smaller sums for non-consumable items, under the control of parents.</p><p>This article spotlights 50 of the best recent examples, all released in 2013, and from a range of developers – from big brands through to indie studios.</p><p>Lots of the latter, too, because they're the companies that can struggle most to be discovered on the crowded app stores, even though they're making well-crafted apps and trying to do the right thing when it comes to making money.</p><p>Yes, most of these apps are on iOS, with a smattering on Android. That's a reflection of the overall children's apps market, rather than lickspittle Cupertino-bribed bias. Really, it is. That said, Android is definitely higher in the priorities for kid-app developers in 2013.</p><p>I've tried to include the widest possible range of developers in this roundup, so there are more Android apps to explore from companies like StoryToys, Oceanhouse Media, Intellijoy, GiggleUp, Wombi Apps and Intellijoy.</p><p>Every developer mentioned in the piece has a link to its website so you can click through to see what other apps they make. Clicking on the platform names (iPhone, iPad and Android) will take you straight to the app stores.</p><p>I'd love to hear your recommendations of apps I've missed (although remember, this roundup is just 2013 releases, which is why some of your favourite apps may be missing).

Sorted alphabetically, each word gets children to drag its letters into place, after which they'll see a characterful animation for its definition. The app includes ads, which you can remove with a single 69p in-app purchase.<br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/endless-alphabet/id591626572?mt=8\">iPhone / iPad</a> by <a href=\"http://www.callaway.com/\">Callaway Digital Arts</a></p><p><strong>Comics in the Classroom (Free + IAP)</strong><br />This is an interesting approach to teaching history to children through digital comics, with topics including Pearl Harbour, Florence Nightingale and Jack the Ripper. Children fill in the speech bubbles to prove their understanding of the subjects. Three comics are included, with additional ones available as 69p in-app purchases.<br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/comics-in-the-classroom/id551046292?mt=8\">iPad</a> by <a href=\"http://www.comicsintheclassroom.co.uk/\">Comics in the Classroom</a></p><p><strong>Hakitzu: Code of the Warrior (Free)</strong><br />This entirely-free app wants to teach children to code using the JavaScript language. It's presented as a game where they build robot warriors and use their coding skills to control them in battles against friends, or in the single-player mode while honing their abilities.<br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hakitzu-code-of-the-warrior/id599976903?mt=8\">iPhone / iPad</a> by <a href=\"http://www.kuatostudios.com\">Kuato Studios</a></p><p><strong>My First 101 Words (&pound;1.49)</strong><br />This is another app for teaching toddlers their first words –&nbsp;you can probably guess how many –&nbsp;but using video rather than just text and narration. Each of the words is demonstrated through video clips starring a boy and girl, with the ability to play and replay each, or shuffle them.<br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/my-first-101-words/id639656655?mt=8\">iPhone / iPad</a> by <a href=\"http://blueprint.tv/\">Blueprint.tv</a></p><p><strong>Mystery Math Town (&pound;1.49)</strong><br />Yes, there's an &quot;s&quot; missing: this is an American app. But my six year-old has taken to it strongly: a game where you explore a series of spooky houses by tapping on stairs, ladders, doors and windows, solving sums before you can go through them using numbers collected along the way. You can tweak the difficulty level and sum-types to suit the age of your child.<br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mystery-math-town-for-iphone/id651515299?mt=8\">iPhone</a> / <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mystery-math-town/id619404402?mt=8\">iPad</a> by <a href=\"http://www.artgigapps.com/\">Artgig Apps</a></p><p><strong>Kids' Vocab – Mindsnacks (Free + IAP)</strong><br />Another impressive app to help children build their essential vocabulary: 7-12 year-olds in this case. The app splits the learning into lessons, each with up to 20 words and phrases taught through colourful mini-games. The first lesson is free, with the full 25 unlocked with a single &pound;2.99 in-app purchase. <br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kids-vocab-mindsnacks/id582128594?mt=8\">iPhone / iPad</a> by <a href=\"http://www.mindsnacks.com/\">MindSnacks</a></p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-411154934\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/19/1371655493895/symmetry-school.jpg\" alt=\"Symmetry School\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Symmetry School: Learning Geometry (&pound;1.99)</strong><br />More maths here, focused on geometry. Developed in Ireland, it gets children to drag and drop coloured counters onto a virtual board to form patterns: as much a puzzle game as it is a maths lesson. Its developer is also providing print-outable extra activities, as well as whiteboard versions and the ability for kids to email their results to a teacher.<br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/symmetry-school-learning-geometry/id648579648?mt=8\">iPad</a> by <a href=\"http://www.spraoischool.com/\">PixelSoup</a></p><p><strong>Kids ABC Trains (&pound;2.56)</strong><br />Aimed at pre-school children, this uses trains and railways as a way to teach kids about letters and phonic sounds. They build a railway by learning each letter, before &quot;driving the train&quot; –&nbsp;tracing letter shapes –&nbsp;loading letter-sound boxes onto it, and matching upper and lower case letters to stop the train running away. A neat metaphor for a neat game.<br /><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intellijoy.abc.trains\">Android</a> by <a href=\"http://www.intellijoy.com/\">Intellijoy</a></p><p><strong>Kids Learn Mandarin Beginner (Free + IAP)</strong><br />Trying to futureproof your child's career prospects by getting them to learn Chinese? It's more common a parental strategy than you'd think in the Western world. This app aims to help, with more than 200 Mandarin words taught through mini-games, videos and text. It's aimed at 2-8 year-olds. One lesson – Numbers –&nbsp;comes with the initial free download, then the rest can be bought in a Basic Pack for &pound;2.99 or a Full Pack for &pound;5.49.<br /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kids-learn-mandarin-beginner/id636317204?mt=8\">iPhone / iPad</a></p><p><strong>On Beyond Bugs: All About Insects (&pound;3.99)</strong><br />This is one of dozens of official Dr. Seuss book-apps, with an educational focus on teaching children about the world of insects &quot;from butterflies and crickets to fireflies and honeybees&quot;.

        "trailText":"<p>BT Sport, Homestyler, My Muppets Show, Breezie, Google AdSense, Rymdkapsel, Dropchord, Tunester, Blood Sword THD, Office Mobile and more. By <strong>Stuart Dredge</strong></p>",
        "headline":"20 best Android apps this week",
        "body":"<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of brand new and notable apps for Android smartphones and tablets.</p><p>It covers apps and games, with the prices referring to the initial download: so (Free) may mean (Freemium) in some cases. The equivalent iOS roundup will be published later in the day.</p><p>For now, read on for this week's Android selection (and when you've finished, check out previous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/best-android-apps\">Best Android apps</a> posts).</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bt.btsport\">BT Sport (Free)</a></h2><p>BT Sport went live this week in the UK to give BSkyB a run for its money in TV sports coverage. Its app is also available, promising live streams of the BT Sport 1, BT Sport 2 and ESPN channels (plus the odd exclusive), catch-up with previously-aired shows, video highlights and second-screen features for people watching live Premier League football matches.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autodesk.homestyler\">Homestyler (Free)</a></h2><p>Autodesk's Homestyler app is aimed at anyone thinking of redecorating their house. It gets you to take a photo of a room, then fiddle about with 3D models of furniture to see how they might look, trying out different colours and textures, while browsing the \"design stream\" to get ideas.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.disney.mysingingmuppets.goo&amp;hl=en_GB\">My Muppets Show (Free)</a></h2><p>It's time to play the music... This new game from Disney turns the Muppets into a free-to-play resource management game, with a musical twist. It involves recruiting a house band from more than 20 Muppets, then keeping them happy and levelling up their skills to make beautiful music. In-app purchases of virtual diamonds fund the action.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.breezie.com/\">Breezie (£299)</a></h2><p>No, that price isn't a typo, but then Breezie isn't just an app. For your 300 quid you get a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 Android tablet with Breezie pre-installed, plus a year's subscription to the service. And that service is? An attempt to make Android easier to use for \"digitally isolated over 55s\" without patronising them. And the device can then be remotely managed by family members or Breezie's own staff.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.ads.publisher\">Google AdSense (Free)</a></h2><p>Google's latest app is clearly only useful if you run a website running AdSense ads. If that's you, expect the ability to browse how much money you're making, analytics of top custom and URL channels, and get individual payment alerts. More features are planned for the coming months.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grapefrukt.games.rymdkapsel1\">Rymdkapsel (£3.29)</a></h2><p>There is considerable buzz around Rymdkapsel this week, and with good reason: it's an addictive, accessible game that offers a twist on the real-time strategy genre. The emphasis is on building a space-base through Tetris-like block-placement, while fending off waves of enemies. It's simple in all the best ways, and well worth the purchase price.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doublefine.rad\">Dropchord (£1.97)</a></h2><p>This may be the best week for new Android games in the platform's history, with a host of impressive new titles jostling for attention. Dropchord is a music game by Double Fine Productions (of <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure\">Kickstarter fame</a>) that sees you manipulating an on-screen laser beam while dodging scratches and collecting notes. Neon-tastic visuals and a 10-track electronica soundtrack add to the fun.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.com.tunester\">Tunester (Free)</a></h2><p>If Rymdkapsel is minimalist and Dropchord is musical, here's something minimalist and musical. Tunester is a music-player app for Android that tries to strip out unnecessary feature-clutter in order to make finding and playing your music collection as fast as possible. Its developer is promising plenty more \"surprises\" in future updates, making this one to watch.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.OneQ.BSTHD\">Blood Sword THD (£0.57)</a></h2><p>One reason for the flurry of new games this week is the release of Nvidia's Shield handheld gaming device. Blood Sword THD is one of the key launch titles, although it'll run on any Android device with a Tegra 4 processor inside. Expect big swords, bigger monsters and plenty of spiffingly-presented combat.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officehub\">Office Mobile for Office 365 (Free)</a></h2><p>Microsoft's long-awaited Office Mobile app is – for now at least – only available in the US for Android smartphones. Tablet owners and the rest of the world will have to wait a little longer. It also requires an Office 365 subscription. If you fulfil the necessary requirements, you'll be able to view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, including email attachments.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wacom.bambooloop\">Bamboo Loop (Free)</a></h2><p>Bamboo Loop is the work of Wacom, designed to work with its Bamboo range of stylus accessories – although it also promises to be \"finger-friendly\". It's a photo-sharing app with Instagram-style filters, and the twist that you can scribble on pics before sharing them on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram itself, or sending them directly to a friend.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inxile.Choplifter_HD\">Choplifter HD (£3.28)</a></h2><p>Helicopter-rescue game Choplifter's latest incarnation is also out in time for the Nvidia Shield's debut, as you fly through a series of 3D environments completing 30 missions of a military nature. Including shaking off zombies, which as far as I'm aware, isn't a part of real-world military helicopter training. Not yet, anyway.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.ravnstudio.cardboard\">Tainted Keep (£3.28)</a></h2><p>More Tegra-powered gaming here – this time for Tegra 3 and Tegra 4 devices – with a high-quality dungeoncrawling game based around saving a village from a nefarious wizard named Morg. Spells, swords and monsters all over the shop.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nifty.touchfreephotohomesync\">TouchFree Photo HomeSync (£1.62)</a></h2><p>One for tech-savvier Android users this: an app that automatically uploads photos and videos from your smartphone to your home server at the same time every night, when in range of your Wi-Fi network. It requires a PHP web-server on the network, with the developer promising support for Google's new Chromecast TV-dongle soon.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clapfootgames.heroforge\">Hero Forge (Free)</a></h2><p>Hero Forge has been around for a while in beta, but is now available to everyone on Google Play. Like a growing number of mobile games, it combines RPG-style features with match-puzzlingL in this case, 3D blocks that you put together in rounds, while also crafting weapons and armour.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.englishbubble.wordbucket\">Word Bucket (Free)</a></h2><p>This is certainly ambitious: \"Your language dictionary, notebook and word learning game all in one great app\". It's an app for language-learning through vocabulary, covering Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Arabic, Korean, Japanese, Russian and English. Mini-games provide the actual learning, and there are social features to link with friends too.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kabam.blastbots\">Blastron (Free)</a></h2><p>Turn-based robo-combat game Blastron has proved popular on iOS, but now Android users can join in the fun. Published by social gaming firm Kabam, it sees you collecting weapons, upgrading your robot and competing against other players around the world in the platform-based action.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetransitapp.droid\">Transit App (Free)</a></h2><p>Another one for Americans: this app covers 43 cities across the US, pulling in timetables for public transit of all kinds, and showing you on a map when the next departures are from the nearest station/stop.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chuckschallenge.chucks3d\">Chuck's Challenge 3D (Free)</a></h2><p>Another game \"enriched\" for Nvidia's Shield handheld, Chuck's Challenge comes from the same braincells that invented popular puzzler Chip's Challenge. That means 125 levels to find your way through, overcoming obstacles and solving puzzles as you go. The game also includes a level creator to make your own and share them with other players – or just browse and play what the community has been creating.</p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sourcebits.twine\">Twine (Free)</a></h2><p>Finally, a local social networking app – the latest among many, admittedly. Twine wants to connect you with \"people nearby that share similar interests with you... your mobile wingman that knows what topics both of you would enjoy talking about\". Which rather relies on lots of people using it, while its aim for an \"even ratio of guys to girls\" seems ambitious. Even so, mobile flirting apps can get popular very quickly, so it's worth watching.</p><p>That's this week's selection, but what do you think? Make your own recommendations, or give your views on the apps above, by posting a comment.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/414198618|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|0499617b9d9b0811c1e7631f4d580269f2442c8f -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Charles Arthur</strong>: Born in a Kickstarter campaign that raised over $10m in a month, Pebble's watch is wearable computing made real. Cleverly, the designers make sure it does a few things really well</p>",
        "headline":"Review: Pebble's smart watch doesn't try too hard - but does what you need",
        "body":"<p>Nowadays, when my phone rings, my wrist buzzes. When someone texts me, I don't look at my phone to find out what they said; I look at my watch.</p><p>Why? I've got a Pebble - the \"smartwatch\" launched on Kickstarter last year which hit its $100,000 target within <em>two hours</em> and had raised $10.2m from nearly 69,000 backers by the time it closed in May 2012 after a month. (I was one of those backers, with my own money.) So far, according to the site, it's delivered 85,000 of its watches, each costing $150 (£98). Yes, it's this year's buzzword, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/18/wearable-technology-vision-of-future\">wearable computing</a>, but you don't have to genuflect to Google or splash out $1,000 to get it. Plus it's unobtrusive.</p><p>Pebble describes it as an \"E-paper watch for iPhone and Android\". The \"e-paper\" bit might get some thinking you're going to be reading books on it. You're definitely not (the screen's only 1.26in - 3.2cm - diagonally). But it is great fun.</p><p>So what do you then get for your money? It's a watch, to start with. The face is 144x168 pixels, a large black/white e-paper display. I chose the black body and strap (you can get it in black, white, cherry red or grey). Open the box, and you're instructed to go to <a href=\"http://getpebble.com/\">getpebble.com</a>. That's a neat touch - no manual at all. The whole initial setup is done through its web page and then app.</p><p>Open that page on your smartphone, and it directs you to the iPhone or Android app store, where you download a free app which connects via Bluetooth. Through that, you can send software updates (such as new watchfaces) and, more usefully, back-and-forth notifications when someone calls or texts. (You can also set it to notify you when you get an email. Don't do this unless you never get email.)</p><p>The watchface is scratch-resistant (not -proof) and has an anti-glare coat; I find it very readable in all lights, except when it's dark. Then you have the options of an automatic backlight (adjusted to light levels), or being able to flick your wrist to activate the backlight. The strap feels like rubber; it's wide (to go with the watch) but not uncomfortable.</p><p>Charging is via a USB lead terminating in a magnetic attachment to a pair of contacts on the left-hand side of the watch; I assume a micro-USB slot would have taken up too much internal space and created waterproofing problems (it is <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android/posts/206882\">waterproof, at least for swimming</a>). So don't lose that charger; you'll be needing it every four or five days (in my limited experience, though the makers claim up to seven.. probably if you have Bluetooth off) and it's unique. </p><p>One bad thing: the interface doesn't show the battery level (even in the phone app), which can leave you in the lurch without warning. The charge level only shows when you're charging, and even then only in the menu, as opposed to standard watch, display.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-409259915'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2013/5/21/1369145134410/Pebble-watch-008.jpg' alt='Pebble watch' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Pebble watch: note the control buttons on the side.</figcaption></figure><p><br />The controls are pleasingly simple. There's a large rectangular button on the left-hand side which takes you back up a level of control; press it enough times and you'll reach the time display, which is the default.</p><p>On the right are three buttons (one large, one small, one large) which function as \"up, choose, down\" for scrolling through menus. Pebble doesn't try to do a lot of things. You turn on the Bluetooth, connect it to your phone, and that's mostly it. You can control the music playback on your phone via the right-hand buttons (it shows the artist, album and track name, though not album art; the buttons will advance a track, play/pause, skip back). However, that's really a party piece; unless you're on the other side of the room, it's simpler just to pull out your phone or, on headphones with a mic, click the control button, than to press the two buttons required to change the music. And yes, running Bluetooth will use some phone battery - perhaps 5% over a normal day. Turn it off, and the Pebble still works as a watch.</p><p>Next you're expecting a touchscreen with icons and apps, aren't you? No such thing. Pebble's designers have wisely held back from overegging the interaction pudding. The screen isn't touch-sensitive, and you won't be squinting and trying to operate tiny physical or onscreen buttons. (Looking at you, <a href=\"http://www.sonymobile.com/gb/products/accessories/smartwatch/\">Sony Smartwatch</a>.) </p><p>Presently, the on-watch functions are simple: you can set alarms; choose different watchfaces (which you download via the phone app); decide how you want the phone's backlight to come on; and whether you want notifications from your phone on. (You probably do, else it's just a watch). On-watch apps haven't happened yet. But there are fortnightly software updates. It's probably coming.</p><h2>Notification</h2><p>It's the notifications that make this stand out. A little bit of configuration on your phone and you can get incoming calls and texts displayed (and emails - only recommended if you never get email). This is the great thing about Pebble: you can figure out whether to ignore a call by looking at the number (if it's in your address book, it'll show up; you can also reject calls from the phone) and you won't miss texts even if your phone is on silent. It's also a lot less intrusive to look at your watch during a meeting than to take out your phone.</p><p>Pebble says you can add calendar alerts, Facebook Messages, tweets, and weather alerts to the notifications; I do wonder what sort of weather alert (short of a tornado) you'd want to know about, but in principle it's putting everything just where you want it. </p><p>I find that I can read entire text messages on it without trouble, though spotting the name of a caller is harder (perhaps because it feels more urgent to decide). </p><p>But phone calls and texts are just the start. Pebble last week released an SDK that will let developers push notifications from third-party apps; think of apps that you'd like to give you updates, but which you don't want to have to keep monitoring your phone for, and you've found a use for the Pebble. It's working on apps for bicyclists, golfers (err…), runners (it syncs with <a href=\"http://runkeeper.com/\">Runkeeper</a>), and whoever else they can think of. (The <a href=\"http://forums.getpebble.com/categories/developer-discussion\">forums are pretty busy</a> with people suggesting stuff.)</p><p>Do I like it? No, I really love it. My wife gives me pitying looks when I try to describe its benefits, but a couple of weeks in the fun hasn't worn off. And the idea that it could connect with more apps (train times? Concert ticket availability? Just think of things you'd like to be quietly notified about) is enticing. If it shipped with those apps and capabilities preinstalled, it would be an instant five-star product. </p><p>One galling point: HM Revenue &amp; Customs, eager to generate tax revenue from somewhere (since it can't seem to get big companies to pay), slaps an import tax of £25.06 on each one. That brings the total price for the device to around £125. Crazy? A bit. But I'm convinced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/18/wearable-technology-vision-of-future\">wearable technology</a> is the future, or at least a significant component of it. And at this price, it's worth it.</p><h2>Speeds and feeds</h2><p><strong>Specifications:</strong> <br />• Load apps using Bluetooth<br />• 144 x 168 pixel display black and white e-paper<br />• Bluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy)<br />• Four buttons<br />• Vibrating motor (for alerts)<br />• Three-axis accelerometer with gesture detection</p><p><strong>Compatibility: </strong>iPhone 3GS, 4, 4S, 5 or any iPod Touch with iOS 5 or iOS 6.

        "body":"<p>Concerns that struggling smartphone company BlackBerry will not survive in its present form appear to be hurting sales of its new phones, both to businesses and retail customers.</p><p>Investment bank Morgan Stanley is delaying a multimillion pound contract to upgrade to BlackBerry's latest smartphones amid concerns the company will not survive, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-29/morgan-stanley-is-said-to-hold-off-on-blackberry-10-upgrade.html\" title=\"\">according to the Bloomberg wire service</a>, which quoted internal sources.</p><p>Meanwhile, industry sources in the UK say the new phones – the touchscreen Z10, introduced in January, and keyboard-based Q10, which went on sale in April – \"haven't exactly flown off the shelves\". In the US, the Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324324404579041190813417918.html\" title=\"\">reported</a> that carrier executives and US retailers called sales of the Q10 \"dismal\", with one multi-store owner seeing virtually no demand.</p><p>The revelations come just weeks after the company announced it had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/12/blackberry-for-sale-smartphone-market\" title=\"\">put itself up for sale</a> as part of a decision to \"explore strategic options\".</p><p>Morgan Stanley, with 55,600 staff, is sticking with its existing handsets using the older BB7 software from 2011, Bloomberg said, and has not made any strategic plans to upgrade despite their age.</p><p>BlackBerry phones are popular inside financial and government organisations because of the encryption applied to data, including email metadata, and their physical keyboard. Some Canadian banks are testing BB10 phones, including Royal Bank of Canada in the company's home country. The Pentagon has also cleared the phones for use on its internal network.</p><p>But growing concerns that it could hit a cash crunch or that carriers will decline to sell its phones – along with growing downward pressure on the price it can charge for its services – has led some businesses to hold off from sizable purchases.</p><p>\"Tech is a confidence game,\" said Douglas Pollitt, who runs the independent brokerage firm Pollitt &amp; Co, which holds BlackBerry stock. \"If there is no confidence in the company, the company won't sell gear.\"</p><p>BlackBerry is just completing its fiscal quarter, which ends on 31 August, and will report on 27 September. Chief executive Thorsten Heins forecast in June that the company would make an operating loss in the quarter, following on from a net loss of $80m last time on sales of $3.1bn.</p><p>He also revealed that it had shipped just 2.7m BB10 phones in that period, out of 6.8m total, as handset shipments slumped from a high in late 2011 of 14.9m.</p><p>The Q10 made a strong start in the UK when it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/blackberry-q10-sellout-uk\" title=\"\">sold exclusively through Selfridges</a>, with thousands being snapped up within hours by business customers, in some cases for immediate export to the Middle East.</p><p>But some customers have since suffered software problems with the handset, leading to returns in some cases.</p><p>The company is trying to remake itself as a software and services company and is preparing to broaden its BlackBerry Messaging (BBM) service, previously exclusive to its own phones, to Apple's iPhone and handsets running Google's Android software.</p><p>A Morgan Stanley spokesperson declined to comment on the report.</p><p>A BlackBerry spokesperson said: \"We don't break out specific device numbers, just a total overall figure we disclose in our quarterly earnings. In terms of the below Bloomberg report, we don't comment on rumour or speculation.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416192066|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|7e72c0eb4366f7eea60513a7590fc37284ae5e24 -->",

        "headline":"Lawyer and champion of free speech Alex Macgillivray to leave Twitter",
        "body":"<p>Alex Macgillivray, the key figure responsible for Twitter's aggressively pro-free speech position, has announced he is to leave the company.</p><p>The Harvard-educated lawyer is little known outside a small crop of Silicon Valley executives and internet advocates. Known to colleagues as \"A-mac\", Macgillivray is described as Twitter's conscience-in-residence and credited with turning the social network into one of the fiercest defenders of user privacy in cyberspace.</p><p>He announced his departure on Friday, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amac/status/373486698631417856\">Twitter</a> and also on his own <a href=\"http://www.bricoleur.org/2013/08/some-news-and-thanks_30.html\">blog</a>. He said he would be replaced by Viyaya Gadde, a member of Twitter's legal team.</p><p>\"I am proud to have worked with colleagues who defend and respect the user's voice; who push freedom of expression and transparency; and who innovate and lead,\" he wrote. \"It has been my privilege to work and fight on behalf of great companies and their users over the last decade. A privilege and a lot of work. So, I'm looking forward to engaging my various internet passions from new and different perspectives.\"</p><p>Macgillivray did not indicate where he might move to, but his decision to leave Twitter comes after a period of intense scrutiny over its systems for reporting abuse. It will leave the industry wondering whether Twitter may now have a less robust defence against government requests for user data, and compromise its position on free speech and privacy online.</p><h2>'The free speech wing of the free speech party'</h2><p>Macgillivray, who has characterised Twitter as \"the free speech wing of the free speech party\", joined the company from Google in September 2009. Then, mundane issues involving trademark and impersonation law were the most frequent to trouble his small team in midtown San Francisco. But as the social network has grown – it now has 200 million registered users – so have the issues it confronts.</p><p>In the past 24 months, Macgillivray has fought US attempts to gain access to the private messages of Occupy protesters and Wikileaks activists. In India, the company has faced government pressure to curb \"inflammatory\" tweets. In the UK, he was summoned before MPs to rebut claims that Twitter was used to fuel riots across England in summer 2011.</p><p>According to his former Harvard law school professor, Jonathan Zittrain, Macgillivray \"thrives in high-pressure environments, even as – or especially because – his presence tends to ratchet down the drama.\"</p><p>In January 2011, Macgillivray penned an ode to freedom of expression with Biz Stone, Twitter's co-founder, under the headline: \"The Tweets Must Flow.\" Posted against a backdrop of rebellion on the streets of Tunisia and Egypt, the 410-word article put the case for unfettered tweets.</p><p>\"I think Alex is one of the few attorneys I know who routinely tries to, and often does, hack the law and use technology to make the law work for people,\" said Cindy Cohn, legal director of the internet rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). \"He thinks about how best to use the current law and technology to bring about a more fair and honest arrangement for Twitter, its employees and its users. That's not easy and he does it well.\"</p><p>Last summer, Macgillivray was faced with a crisis that went to the heart of his pledge to \"let the tweets flow\". The company admitted in a blogpost that it had encouraged the US broadcaster NBC, its partner during the London Olympics, to file a formal complaint about the journalist Guy Adams that led to his account being suspended.</p><p>Adams had posted the corporate email address of an NBC executive, alongside a string of pointed tweets about the company's Olympics coverage. When it emerged that Twitter had proactively monitored Adams' tweets before encouraging its partner to file a formal complaint, the social network was accused of commercially-induced censorship.</p><p>Two weeks later, Adams received a surprise telephone call from Macgillivray. \"Apart from him I didn't have a single contact from anyone at that company,\" said Adams. \"I couldn't quite work out what he wanted to achieve from the conversation except to listen to what I had to say. He was very affable – the sort of guy you could spend a very enjoyable afternoon at the baseball with – and just asked for advice on how not to screw up in the future.\"</p><p>He added: \"Most companies grown organically over decades, but Twitter has grown exponentially in the space of a few years and frankly I think the head doesn't know what the backside is up to. Twitter finds itself slightly outpaced by the news agenda and I suppose he's trying to play catch up a lot of the time.\"</p><p>More recently, Twitter has avoided being dragged into controversy surrounding the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance program, Prism. The company was not named in leaked NSA slides that claimed Google, Microsoft and othes had cooperated with Prism, although those companies have repeatedly denied all knowledge of the program.</p><h2>A tech background</h2><p>Like many of the technology sector's most prominent lawyers, Macgillivray got his grounding at Google. He spent eight years in Mountain View, becoming the company's primary attorney for key products including web search and Gmail – and later its controversial plans to scan millions of out-of-print library books.</p><p>Zittrain described Macgillivray as a star pupil with a \"wonderfully droll\" sense of humour, who was \"very much aware of the power of software code, not just legal code\". At Harvard, Macgillivray co-programmed software so the university could experiment with distance learning. His experimental hacking – which he did with Wendy Saltzer, the widely-respected internet lawyer and policy counsel at the World Wide Web Consortium – was not his first.</p><p>\"I distinctly recall trying without success to keep up with the news on internet-related legal developments that was coming fast and furious,\" said a former colleague, David Kramer, a copyright lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati (WSGR). \"Alex always seemed a step ahead. Why? Because he was using a specialised news aggregation tool that he had coded himself.\"</p><h2>Twitter's 'grave, crushing responsibility' as a gatekeeper</h2><p>The challenges and opportunities Macgillivray faced at Twitter were great and many. The Adams saga underlined the dangers ahead as the company multiplies and enhances its relationships with commercial firms, like NBC or the mobile network EE. It remains to be seen whether Twitter can truly pledge to \"let the tweets flow\", independent of business pressures – particularly with a hotly-anticipated public flotation on the horizon.</p><p>According to Zittrain, the company's ability to instantly take down any message brings with it a \"grave, even crushing\" responsibility, overrun with contradictory demands. He suggested that Twitter could go further to install its values, including by structuring private direct messages so that it cannot readily scan and produce them for governments. Or, for example, separating its commercial unit from the rest of the company, in the spirit of a church-state divide.</p><p>Under new general counsel Vijaya Gadde, the company must turn those challenges into opportunities, and set a standard for best practice that others will follow.</p><p>\"I couldn't be happier with her appointment,\" Macgillivray said, as Gadde pledged to \"continue to defer users around the world\". Macgillivray will bow out slowly, handing the workload to Gadde, who is well liked in the company, if less strident in her views on free speech and the rights of Twitter's users.</p><p>Despite Silicon Valley gossip pointing to a reorganisation of Twitter's legal department, a tension between Macgillivray and chief executive Dick Costolo, and a desire to leave before the administrative burden of Twitter's IPO next year, the general counsel's departure is largely amicable.</p><p>\"Things at Twitter often move at the speed of thought,\" said Kramer. \"There can be instant, worldwide attention and feedback on any action the company takes or fails to take. That puts enormous pressure on the team.</p><p>\"Of course, when they get things right, as they invariably do, their decisions and the example they set echo throughout the Twitterverse and beyond.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/416198650|2013-09-02T21:32:46Z|4ed1f89d8bd05f56af52d66ebe45f17871a18572 -->",
