Liu's coach had expressed concern about his recurrent foot injury in the last few days in widely reported remarks, leading many to conclude his prospects of reclaiming his title were poor.</p><p>Wearing heavy strapping on his right achilles, Liu rose from the blocks in his opening heat, but hit his first hurdle and fell to the ground. He stood up and hopped on his left leg back towards the start, then turned around and tottered all the way down the straight.</p><p>Some of the commentators on Chinese state television were unable to control their tears. The subject immediately dominated domestic microblogs, with around 20m mentions of a \"Liu crashed\" hashtag within half an hour of his tumble. \"Liu fell to the ground. So did the hearts of 1.3 billion people,\" wrote one user. Some dubbed him \"Liu Shuai Shuai\" (\"Liu Fell Fell\") and spoke harshly of his failure.</p><p>One cynical microblogger wrote: \"Liu is the best actor in the world.\" But most showed their sympathy, with one user writing: \"Anyway, you were already the champion when you made it to the field.\" Another scolded the critics, writing: \"Maybe there is a low point for everyone. It would be to heartless to satirize or mock Liu. Let's pray for him!\"</p><p><em>Additional research by Kathy Gao</em></p>","headline":"Liu Xiang pulls up in opening race at second consecutive Olympics","trailText":"Liu Xiang, China's accident-prone poster boy at the 2008 Games, has again failed to reach his first hurdle in his 110m hurdles heat","shouldHideAdverts":"false","publication":"theguardian.com","showInRelatedContent":"true","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/39hgg","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/8/7/1344334842118/Liu-Xiang--003.jpg","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/8/7/1344334842118/Liu-Xiang--003.jpg","wordcount":"389","commentable":"false","internalContentCode":"394296766","allowUgc":"false","internalOctopusCode":"6513579","isPremoderated":"false","byline":"Tania Branigan and James Callow","newspaperEditionDate":"2012-08-07T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"1784311","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2012-08-10T10:22:28Z"},"rights":{"syndicatable":true,"subscriptionDatabases":true},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/liu-xiang-injured-olympics","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/sport/2012/aug/07/liu-xiang-injured-olympics","tags":[{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","references":[],"type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/tone/news"},{"id":"profile/taniabranigan","webTitle":"Tania Branigan","rcsId":"GNL004773","r2ContributorId":"16507","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/tania_branigan_140x140.jpg","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tania Branigan is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china\">China correspondent</a> for the Guardian</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/taniabranigan","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/profile/taniabranigan"},{"id":"sport/china-olympic-team","webTitle":"China Olympic team","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/china-olympic-team","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/sport/china-olympic-team"},{"id":"sport/athletics","webTitle":"Athletics","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/sport/athletics"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/world/china"},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2012","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012"},{"id":"sport/olympics-2012-athletics","webTitle":"Olympics 2012: athletics","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012-athletics","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/sport/olympics-2012-athletics"},{"id":"profile/james-callow","webTitle":"James Callow","r2ContributorId":"33780","references":[],"type":"contributor","bio":"<p>James Callow is a sports journalist for the Guardian and the Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/james-callow","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/profile/james-callow"},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","references":[],"type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/type/article"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport","references":[],"type":"keyword","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport","apiUrl":"http://concierge.content.guardianapis.com/sport/sport"}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-image-394297037","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/8/7/1344334839435/Liu-Xiang--001.jpg","typeData":{"source":"Reuters","photographer":"Stefan Wermuth","altText":"Liu Xiang ","height":"54","credit":"Stefan Wermuth/Reuters","caption":"China's Liu Xiang holds his leg after suffering an injury during his men's 110m hurdles round one heat.
