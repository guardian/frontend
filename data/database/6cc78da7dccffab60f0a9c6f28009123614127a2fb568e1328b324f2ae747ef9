Plaques were unveiled last year in memory of Fred Perry, Britain's most successful male tennis player, Constance Spry, florist for the Queen's wedding and coronation, and the writers, Jean Rhys and Elizabeth Bowen.</p><p>The only previous time installations have been stopped was between 1915 to 1919 and 1940 to 1947, coinciding with the wartime economies of the first and second world wars.</p><p>A spokeswoman for English Heritage said: \"Following our 34% funding cut in the 2010 spending settlement, English Heritage commissioners made the decision that the blue plaques scheme was to be funded in an alternative way in the future.</p><p>\"As a step towards creating a new and more self-sustaining scheme, the blue plaques team will be reduced to two people during 2013.</p><p>\"They will continue to erect plaques already agreed by the independent advisory panel and work up the details of a new approach to running the scheme that will be announced in 2014.\"</p><p>The heritage body said its decision to reduce staff and suspend new installations would allow it to make savings of £240,000 over the next two years. Possible sources of finance after 2014 could come from private investment or other heritage foundations, the spokeswoman said.</p><p>• This article was amended on 7 January 2013. The original said funding for blue plaques would drop from £130m in 2010-11 to £92m in 2014.
