        "body":"<p>When 117 cardinals gather in Rome <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/12/pope-ability-tackle-church-problem\" title=\"\">to choose the next pope</a> this month, the first thing that will determine their choice is what job they are hiring the man for. Catholicism is in a crisis: the historian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/video/2013/feb/28/pope-benedict-diarmaid-macculloch-video\" title=\"\">Diarmaid MacCulloch</a> compares it to the great changes of the Reformation and the medieval reforms, 400 years earlier, under Pope Innocent VII.</p><p>The convulsions that started with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/oct/11/second-vatical-council-50-years-catholicism\" title=\"\">second Vatican council</a> of the 1960s have still not played themselves out. On the other hand, the pope will still be a Catholic. There are not going to be female priests, and only what absolutely has to change will change. The ban on contraception will remain: the best \u2013 and the least \u2013 that can happen is that it is quietly ignored, even by the hierarchy, and no longer used as the shibboleth of orthodoxy in any priest who wants promotion. Some things can't change, and we shouldn't assume that the new leader will take up the agenda of the Guardian or the New York Times.</p><p>But it's clear from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/11/pope-resigns-live-reaction\" title=\"\">the pope's resignation</a> that he knows things can't go on as they are. So what does the crisis look like from Rome?</p><p>It seems to me that there are three interlocking difficulties for the church. There is crisis in the curia, the Vatican itself. There is a crisis in the clergy. And in the developed world, there is a crisis in the laity.</p><p>There is also a strategic problem in that the church must deal with the increasing militancy of Islam in the Middle East, and, beyond that, the rise of China and India. But that doesn't require new thinking, just the application of well-practised principles.</p><p>The problems of the laity and clergy are intertwined, and in the developed world their symptom is obvious: there are not enough of either, and both are ageing rapidly and sustained only by immigration from the south.</p><p>There is little that a pope can do directly about the problem of the shrinking laity, even in an age of global travel. Wherever he goes, he can draw vast crowds, but the interest and excitement subside when he has gone. The congregations continue to drain away.</p><p>The effect has been most marked in places where Catholicism was part of the national or regional identity \u2013 Ireland, Quebec, Boston and France come to mind. But it has happened almost everywhere in the developed world. And in the countries where churchgoing has shrunk, the clergy have also got older and \u2013 by report \u2013 more gay. Seminaries have closed. More and more priests are imported from Africa, from Latin America, and from the Philippines or Vietnam.</p><p>That is something the new pope could do something about, but only by relaxing the mandatory celibacy rule. To allow the ordination of already married men on a much wider scale than already happens with Anglican converts would transform the priesthood and bind it much more closely to the laity. From the outside, such a development looks inevitable.</p><p>Whether it seems so simple inside the Sistine chapel is another question. But, if it does, the electors will choose accordingly. Paradoxically, they are more likely then to choose a cardinal from Latin America or Asia, where the celibacy rules are already widely ignored, than from Europe or North America, where they are followed in the letter, if not in spirit.</p><p>Changing the rules on celibacy would still be a convulsive step that would bring fresh problems of its own. But it may appear to the cardinals a necessary and unavoidable adjustment to a reality that can no longer be denied.</p><p>The problem of the curia is different in nature. The central administration of the Vatican is plagued by corruption allegations and obstructionism. It functions too much like the rest of Italy. A pope of enormous energy and willpower and administrative experience would be needed to clean it out. Yet this, too, may be inevitable, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/03/vatican-leaks-pope-benedict-documents\" title=\"\">the VatiLeaks scandal</a> showed. The Italian model of politics doesn't even work in Italy. You can't run a global organisation on those principles.</p><p>Any loosening of central control would also be fraught with dangers for the church's coherence. A liberal reformer might suffer the fate of a Gorbachev and be swept aside by the forces he unleashed. I suspect that the reform of the curia would be the priority of any non-Italian European, such as <a href=\"http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/interview-cardinal-christoph-sch%C3%B6nborn\" title=\"\">Cardinal Christoph Sch&ouml;nborn</a> of Austria. But I doubt the electors have any great enthusiasm for the task.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/404782207|2013-03-04T17:19:44Z|36ffcdfdd25a1a45f60d5ab90e1270ad11c2e909 -->",

        "body":"<p>Italians fatigued by politics may have switched on the television on Sunday night for a spot of escapism. Showing in all its licentious glory was the first episode of historical drama The Borgias, in which Jeremy Irons stars as dastardly Pope Alexander VI and the Roman Catholic church is depicted as a hotbed of rivalry and intrigue.</p><p>If it had been up to Aiart, an association of Catholic TV viewers, however, the programme would not have been shown. \"It would be fitting for the broadcast \u2026 to be postponed. This is in fact a delicate period for the church, for the papacy,\" said Luca Borgomeo, Aiart's chairman. \"Believers are able to make the appropriate distinctions [between the show] and the current situation, but can non-believers \u2026 do the same?\"</p><p>Borgomeo's question was puzzling in many respects, not least because, until then, not even the most critical of observers had thought to compare the admittedly troubled Vatican of today to its almost implausibly corrupt Renaissance equivalent.</p><p>But the sensitivity was telling. In the wake of Benedict XVI's abdication and in the runup to conclave, the church is indeed going through a delicate period with the spotlight turned on its own scandals and conspiracies. On Monday, as the previous pope settles into retirement 15 miles away, cardinals from all over the world will meet in Rome to begin the process of choosing his successor. Top of the list for many will be a leader who will clean up the mess left by Benedict's crisis-hit papacy.</p><p>Through a series of meetings known as general congregations \u2013 the first two of which will be held on Monday morning and Monday afternoon \u2013 the so-called \"princes of the church\" will begin discussions on church and conclave matters, meeting, mingling and sizing each other up. One of the first things they will need to agree on is when the 115 cardinal electors \u2013 all those under the age of 80 \u2013 will enter the Sistine chapel for the beginning of conclave. The Vatican is keen for a new pope to be in office by Palm Sunday on 24 March and Easter Sunday on 31 March, making a conclave a likelihood for next Monday. But this still needs to be made official.</p><p>And timing is far from the only thing they will be discussing. Observers say that this conclave will be open, with no obvious frontrunner and about a dozen or so names tipped by various sources as <em>papabile</em> (literally, pope-able). The fluidity of the situation means that this week of formal and not so formal gatherings will be a crucial stage of lobbying. While key issues for the church are discussed \u2013 such as the future of its relationship with Islam \u2013 cardinals will be keeping a sharp eye out for who says what. Remarks will be noted; positions detailed; candidate profiles built up and, quite possibly, chances destroyed.</p><p>At the moment the big names circulating include the Canadian Marc Ouellet, Italian Angelo Scola, Austrian Christoph Schoenborn and Argentina's Leonardo Sandri, who on Sunday told Reuters the church should open up more leadership positions to women. According to Italian daily La Stampa, a faction led by the powerful dean of the college of cardinals is mobilising behind the Brazilian Odilo Scherer, archbishop of Sao Paulo.</p><p>All the candidates will, however, be aware of the old adage that warns against putting too much faith in the pre-conclave whisperings. \"He who goes into conclave a pope,\" it says, \"comes out a cardinal.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/404949388|2013-03-04T17:19:44Z|2650aeb6750884e3f884d11c429062941d5ae32c -->",
