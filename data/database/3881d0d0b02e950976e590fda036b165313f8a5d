There are various ways that the US could play for time -- such as prioritising some payments over others, or&nbsp;delaying payments altogether.</p> <p>But officials would soon be forced to implement measures that would hurt growth badly, in a bid to avoid missing a&nbsp;debt repayment and triggering a downgrade to<strong> Selective Default</strong> status.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here's a flavour of the note:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the debt limit is not raised before the Treasury depletes its cash&nbsp;balance, it could force the Treasury to rapidly eliminate the budget&nbsp;deficit to stay under the debt ceiling. We estimate that the fiscal&nbsp;pullback would amount to as much as 4.2% of GDP (annualized). The&nbsp;effect on quarterly growth rates (rather than levels) could be even&nbsp;greater. If this were allowed to occur, it could lead to a rapid downturn&nbsp;in economic activity if not reversed very quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>And more detail....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A very short delay past the&nbsp;October deadline—for instance, a few days—could delay the payment of some obligations&nbsp;already incurred and would create instability in the financial markets. This uncertainty alone could weigh on growth.</p> <p>But a long delay—for example, several weeks—would likely result in a government&nbsp;shutdown much broader than the one that started October 1. In the current shutdown,&nbsp;there is ample cash available to pay for government activities, but the administration has&nbsp;lost its authority to conduct &quot;non-essential&quot; discretionary programs which make up about&nbsp;15% of the federal budget.</p> <p>By contrast, if the debt limit were not increased, after late&nbsp;October the administration would still have authority to make most of its scheduled&nbsp;payments, but would not have enough cash available to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52527967e4b041f09f138ad5\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:24:41.487+01:00\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">US deadlock hits euro investors</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1b0128f8-a791-467e-8c2f-2c8feb559585\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381137864207/c92997d0-b72a-45e4-b1a7-acc6724d5a32-460x264.png\" alt=\"Eurozone investor confidence\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Sentix</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>The US government shutdown debacle has hit&nbsp;</strong><strong>investor confidence within the eurozone</strong>,&nbsp;according to the latest data from German research firm <strong>Sentix.</strong></p> <p>Sentix's monthly measure of investor sentiment dropped to 6.1, from 6.5 in September.

        "headline":"City optimism highest since mid-1990s as economy recovers",
        "body":"<p>Britain's bankers are feeling increasingly optimistic, as the financial sector reaps the benefits of the upturn in the wider economy.</p><p>In its latest quarterly survey of the industry, business group the CBI says the turnaround in confidence among banks, insurers and City fund managers over the three months to September was the fastest since the mid-1990s. Business volumes at banks fell over the quarter but firms across the sector as a whole told PWC, which compiles the survey, that they expect revenue and profits to increase over the next three months. They are also hiring staff and investing in IT to cope with increased volumes of business.</p><p>Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics, said: \"with optimism rising and jobs and profitability growing, this is an encouraging quarter.\"</p><p>News of the more upbeat mood among City firms echoes a series of other surveys that have added weight to George Osborne's assertion that the UK has, \"turned a corner\".</p><p>City consultancy Capital Economics has revised its UK growth forecasts, upwards after a string of optimistic data. Capital, which expects GDP to expand by 1.5% this year and 2.5% in 2014, rejects the argument that the recovery is based on too much borrowing, or an unsustainable housing bubble.</p><p>\"The housing market has played a minor role in pushing up consumer confidence and consumer spending. And with net mortgage lending close to zero, there is little  evidence that the recovery is built on a renewed accumulation of debt either,\" Capital's analysts say.</p><p>To support the recovery further, the government has announced that it will inject a further £100m into a new batch of Enterprise Zones to boost transport and telecommunications links. The fledgling zones, which began life in 2011 offering tax breaks, looser planning restrictions and infrastructure subsidies, will be consulted from today on the type of infrastructure spending that is most needed over the coming year. New sites in Cheshire, Essex, Cornwall, Gosport, Hereford and the Humber Estuary could bebefit from the extra cash.</p><p>Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: \"The Zones are showing progress with over 180 businesses, £500m of private sector investment and nearly 4,000 jobs, and many more in the pipeline.\"</p><p>\"We want to help them grow further and faster and this extra £100 million investment will ensure they have the infrastructure in place to successfully attract even more businesses and create many more local jobs.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419196150|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9ee44d81552a1bc1116ecd5db8db9a79912ce8a0 -->",

Japan Airlines has the option to buy a further 25.</p><p>It is a significant win for Airbus and the A350, which is designed to be more fuel efficient. The aircraft is a direct competitor of Boeing's Dreamliner, which has been bit by safety and technical issues this year.</p><p>Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines (JAL), said the A350 fleet would allow the company to take advantage of \"new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased\".</p><p>The new JAL Airbus fleet is scheduled to be operational from 2019, gradually replacing its ageing fleet over a six-year period.</p><p>Of the 31 aircraft ordered, 18 will be A350-900s, which typically offer three classes of seating and carry more than 300 passengers.</p><p>The remaining 13 will be A350-1000s, which seat 350 passengers on longer flights.</p><p>Fabrice Bregier, the Airbus president and chief executive, said the order marked a \"new chapter\" for the aircraft maker in Japan.</p><p>Airbus has now received orders for more than 750 A350s from 38 customers worldwide and it is hoped that the first of the new aircraft will be ready for commercial service in the second half of 2014.</p><p>News of the order was also welcomed by British company Rolls-Royce, which will supply its Trent engine for all 31 aircraft.</p><p>In a separate announcement Rolls said it had won two contracts, with a combined value of up to $496m, to support T56 engines on US government aircraft.</p><p>Under the six-year contract the FTSE 100 company will supply parts and field and engineering support for thousands of T56 engines, which have been in production since the 1950s.</p><p>The contract, awarded by the Defence Logistics Agency, will support around 1,000 C-130, P-3 and C-2 aircraft in service with the US Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Customs and Border Control as well as international fleets.</p><p>Rolls was also handed a contract worth up to $90m by the US Navy, involving engine repairs for E-2 Hawkeye aircraft, which are powered by two T56-A-427 engines.</p><p>The five-year contract is renewable annually and is valued at $17m for the first year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419229282|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b55752f7523e1c4af8dedf7325bdbbbee9906b07 -->",

        "body":"<p>With markets nervous again as the US government shutdown continues and the country's debt ceiling deadline edges ever nearer, it is a UK retailer leading the FTSE 100 fallers.</p><p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> is down nearly 3%, 14p lower at 480p after a downbeat note from Credit Suisse. Analyst Simon Irwin put an underperform rating and 425p price target on the shares, saying:</p><p><blockquote>We believe that the second quarter has been slower than expected for M&amp;S's UK general merchandise so we are cutting second quarter like for like forecasts from +0.5% to -1.5%, and with higher mark-down over the summer and an earlier mid- season sale, we now forecast first half general merchandise gross margin -40 basis points (versus full year guidance +30-50 basis points).<br /><br />While the long-awaited autumn/winter ranges show some signs of improvement we don't not believe they are sufficient to transform like for like sales or margins, over the next year given that the slow migration of supply chain and IT continues to constrain the ability to trade the business. In the mean time, the bulk of the planned £350m of benefits continue to swallowed up (including an additional £100m of depreciation over two years) making it increasingly hard for management to surprise on operating expenditure.<br /><br />Having risen 30% year to date, [the shares] look overbought (as does much of the sector), particularly given the likelihood of further pressure on earnings. <br /></blockquote></p><p>He forecast first half profits of £235m, down 20% year on year:</p><p><blockquote>Although we are not cutting full year forecasts (clean pretax profit of £668m, up 0.5% year on year), first half profits would represent 35% of our full year forecast which compares with an average of 46% over the past 7 years, and second half profits will therefore have to increase by 18% year on year. This is just possible, if everything goes right in general merchandise, food and international. However after three years of steady downgrades, and a relatively wide consensus range, the top end of the range (more than £700m pretax profit) looks set to fall even if management maintain guidance on costs and gross margins.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 54.54 points at 6399.34 as US politicians continue to argue over the budget, ahead of the 17 October deadline for resolving the debt ceiling problem. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:</p><p><blockquote>The congressional stalemate shows no signs of progress with House Speaker Boehner adamant that a clean spending bill will not be approved while Treasury Secretary Lew says congress is playing with fire putting the nation's sovereign reputation at risk, on top of President Obama's highlighting of the potential impact on fourth quarter GDP.<br /><br />There are also fears that October could be a lost month for important official US macro data meaning November lacks a comparable and pushes analysis into December, possibly even January. Rating agency Moody's says US default is extremely unlikely with debt payments being made even after the deadline.<br /><br />With the Fed/markets using data to decide/price in policy changes and tapering, the waters may still remain muddied even after a budget/debt ceiling solution.

        "body":"<p>The current<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/30/us-shutdown-explainer-non-americans\"> US government shutdown</a> has little impact on Australia, but if the US hits the debt ceiling Australia will feel the consequences of a<a href=\"http://voteview.com/images/Senate_means_2013.png\"> bitterly partisan</a> US political system.</p> <p>One of the more ironic aspects of the US government shutdown is that if it goes on for much longer, the government won’t be able to calculate its economic impact because it won’t be able to collect the data.</p> <p>Last Friday was supposed to be the most recent release of US jobs figures, and yet those logging on to the<a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/\"> BLS website</a> would have seen this:</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e48a67da-eccb-498e-aaeb-cdb553b5e125\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381130287519/a067e7aa-6a52-43b4-bab0-f2d500b5ccd2-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Bureau of Labor Statistics web page\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</figcaption> </figure> <p>During the shutdown the BLS won’t be able to collect the data to calculate the employment figures. Similarly the<a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/\"> Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> is also shut down, which rather makes collating data for the GDP figures a tad tricky.</p> <p>But for Australians the big issue is not so much the shutdown. Costly as it is to the American economy – wiping about 0.1% of GDP growth each week – it does not have a great direct impact outside its borders. After all there are not many Australians employed by the US government or about to go to a US national park this weekend. The real bitter pill for the rest of the world (and US) comes in a couple weeks when the US reaches its debt ceiling.</p> <p>The debt ceiling is often lazily referred to as the US government’s credit card limit, but it is not about giving the US government the right to spend more, but the ability to borrow to pay off spending it has already undertaken.</p> <p>The debt ceiling is currently at $US16.699tn, and was actually reached in May but the US treasury was able to employ some “<a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44324\">extraordinary measures</a>” to keep borrowing. These measures will run out on 17 October.</p> <p>At that point the US will no longer be able to borrow money to pay its bills. In the short run that is OK, because the US government gets enough cash from tax revenue to cover its expenses. But on 1 November it gets a bill for US$67bn for social security, medicare and veterans benefits. By 15 November the US government will be short about US$108bn. And that means defaulting on its payments.</p> <p>No one really knows what will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised. Views range from,<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/richardfinger/2013/10/04/the-u-s-debt-ceiling-fallacy-agreement-or-not-there-will-be-no-default/\"> it’ll be fine</a>, to<a href=\"http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/bulletin/economic-armageddon-a-list-of-what-happens-if-the-us-defaults/30828\"> it’ll be Armageddon</a>. The US Treasury for its part has put<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Report-on-Macroeconomic-Effect-of-Debt-Ceiling-Brinkmanship.aspx\"> out a paper</a> that paints a pretty scary picture.</p> <p>After looking at what has occurred in 2011 when the US nearly reached the debt limit, it concluded that a debt default “could have a catastrophic effect on not just financial markets but also on job creation, consumer spending and economic growth”.</p> <p>It also noted that “many private-sector analysts believing that it would lead to events of the magnitude of late 2008 or worse, and the result then was a recession more severe than any seen since the Great Depression”.</p> <p>And just in case you are a glass-half-full kind of person and you still have some optimism, the report ends on this less than upbeat note: “Considering the experience of countries around that world that have defaulted on their debt... [the] consequences, including high interest rates, reduced investment, higher debt payments, and slow economic growth, could last for more than a generation.”</p> <p>Cheery.</p> <p>Thus far the markets have been rather sanguine. The<a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield\"> US Treasury 10-year bond yields</a> are lower now than they were a month ago – suggesting investors are not too spooked about the long-term US economy. There is also a sense that investors are a bit jaded – the debt ceiling fight is now becoming an annual event.</p> <p>But in the past few days, investors have become very worried about holding US treasury bonds which mature in the next month.</p> <p>The spread of the six-month to one-month treasury bonds fell off a cliff, to the point where investors are now demanding a higher return for buying a one-month US treasury bond than for a six-month.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0d54abba-d8a0-48f0-8f20-342f478441e1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381130642571/fa3ba318-a8a8-41a3-ac74-da75a585468b-460x248.jpeg\" alt=\"Spread of US six-month to one-month bonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"248\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Source: US Treasury</figcaption> </figure> <p>Should the default actually occur you could expect those jaded investors would suddenly get very alert. A US government default would put the world economy into uncharted waters. Around 87 % of all foreign exchange transactions involve US dollars. If the US government can no longer guarantee it will pay its bills (even for a short time), that rather upsets the integrity of the entire system.</p> <p>In 2011 when the debt ceiling was almost breached, the US’s credit rating was downgraded to AA. It hurt US confidence, put a big hand brake on economic growth, and the turmoil on financial markets reduced American household wealth by around US$2.4tn.</p> <p>For Australia, in 2011 our dollar at the time soared to US$1.10 as the American currency lost value. With the value of our dollar already rising the last thing our manufacturing sector needs is for the dollar to be given a boost.</p> <p>For the moment most expect congress to back down and raise the debt ceiling (or perhaps even suspend it for a few more months like they did<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/22/suspending-the-debt-ceiling-is-a-great-idea-lets-do-it-forever/\"> last year</a>).</p> <p>But Australians should hope that the US gets its act in order soon. While it is nice to think that we are now bound to China, a look over the past 20 years shows that aside from extraordinary circumstances – such as the dotcom bubble and September 11 attack, and our mining boom in 2006 – Australia and the US’s GDP growth is quite closely linked.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-364611b3-ad70-41e8-adde-3e10059319b2\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381130825832/724cd7db-e430-448a-8a37-d5b81e01245b-460x245.jpeg\" alt=\"US and Australian GDP growth\" width=\"460\" height=\"245\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Source: OECD</figcaption> </figure> <p>Our economy is like a dinghy in the ocean of the international economy. If the US scuttles itself though political intransigence, without another mining boom, little HMAS Australia would find it tough not to get sucked into the vortex as USS America goes down.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419208785|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|5e14ff006200b9f37c3b71f3a8d20cebf9d3ebbf -->",

        "headline":"World Bank cuts China growth forecasts",
        "body":"<p>The World Bank lowered its 2013 and 2014 economic growth forecasts for China and most of developing East Asia on Monday. It cited slower growth in the world's most populous nation as well as weaker commodity prices that have hurt exports and investments in countries such as Indonesia.</p> <p>\"Developing East Asia is expanding at a slower pace as China shifts from an export-oriented economy and focuses on domestic demand,\" the World Bank said in its latest East Asia Pacific Economic Update report.</p> <p>\"Growth in larger middle-income countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand is also softening in light of lower investment, lower global commodity prices and lower-than-expected growth of exports,\" it added.</p> <p>The Washington-based development bank now expects developing East Asia to expand by 7.1% this year and by 7.2% in 2014, down from its April estimate of 7.8% and 7.6%, respectively.</p> <p>On China, the World Bank said the massive, investment-heavy stimulus program supported by credit expansion had run its course, and policymakers must focus on containing the rapid growth of credit and tighten financial supervision.</p> <p>It added local government debt was a concern, given the complexity and opacity of municipal finances, and said they should be reformed \"with clear rules on borrowing, on allowed sources of borrowing, on debt resolution, and on the disclosure of comprehensive financial accounts by local governments\".</p> <p>\"The rapid expansion of shadow banking poses serious challenges, since shadow banking is closely linked to the banking system, is less regulated, and operates with implicit guarantees from banks and local governments,\" the World Bank said.</p> <p>But it added local governments in China had significant assets to meet liabilities as they held land reserves worth 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) as well as shares in state-owned enterprises worth a similar amount.</p> <p>China had shown some progress in rebalancing its economy, it added, with consumption contributing more to quarterly growth than investment in the two years up to the first quarter of 2013 and services accounting for a larger share of GDP.</p> <p>\"Still, the economy has yet to make the decisive turn toward consumer-based growth,\" the World Bank said.</p> <p>It now expects the Chinese economy to expand by 7.5% this year, down from its April forecast of 8.3% and below the International Monetary Fund's most recent forecast of 7.75%.</p> <p>China's 2014 growth is estimated at 7.7%, the World Bank said, down 0.3 percentage point from the previous prediction.</p> <p>The IMF is due to publish its new world economic outlook on Tuesday ahead of the fund's annual meeting.</p> <p>Turning to Indonesia, the World Bank said investment growth reached a three-year low in the second quarter and is likely to face headwinds from interest rate hikes in response to rising inflation and capital outflows as well as from a slowdown in foreign direct investment and regulatory uncertainties.</p> <p>\"Lower global commodity prices have dampened export receipts and slowed private investment in the capital-intensive resource sectors of the Indonesian economy, depressing overall growth,\" the World Bank said.</p> <p>The World Bank cut its growth forecast for Indonesia to 5.6% for 2013 and 5.3% next year, down from its previous estimates of 6.2% and 6.5%, respectively.</p> <p>As for the Philippines, investments slowed in the second quarter after a strong first three months of the year. But remittances from Filipinos working abroad boosted consumption, which contributed three-fourths to growth in the April-June.</p> <p>The World Bank expects the Philippines to grow by 7% this year, much faster than the April forecast of 6.2%. For 2014, the economy would probably expand by 6.7%, better than the previous estimate of 6.4%.</p> <p>The World Bank said its latest regional forecasts faced greater likelihood of being revised downwards than upwards, citing potential headwinds such as a less orderly tapering of the U.S. Federal Reserve's stimulus programme and a prolonged fiscal deadlock in Washington.</p> <p>World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Bert Hofman added, however, that the reversal of capital flows in developing East Asia may be offset by Japan's new strategy to exit deflation and revive growth, commonly referred to as \"Abenomics\".</p> <p>Japan's efforts to reflate its economy could spill over to emerging Asian economies through expanded bank lending, portfolio rebalancing, and increased outward foreign direct investment, he said.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419211648|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|670034e459d090dadb6a090f6d9547bde9edb930 -->",

        "body":"<p>The chief executive of Qantas, Alan Joyce, says he is comfortable that new Boeing 787 Dreamliners being delivered to budget carrier Jetstar are extremely safe despite some reliability issues.</p> <p>The first of the high-tech jets for Jetstar's international routes are due to be delivered to Melbourne on Wednesday, only weeks after budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle demanded Boeing take back a plane and fix a faulty hydraulic pump after only 30 days in service.</p> <p>Visiting Boeing's factory in Seattle, Joyce said: \"It's important to distinguish reliability from safety. Sometimes in people's minds they can be really concerned.</p> <p>\"Reliability in new aircraft takes a while to get up there. It's not a safety issue.</p> <p>\"We're very comfortable this is an extremely safe aircraft.\"</p> <p>The Boeing 787 vice-president and general manager, Larry Loftis, said the ambition to build the most technologically advanced aircraft in five decades had been a logistical challenge since production began in 2007.</p> <p>\"From a reliability standpoint ... we're working to make sure the airplane continually improves and becomes more and more reliable,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We put a lot of new technology in this aircraft and over-estimated the ability to bring this new technology to market in the timeframe to which we committed.\"</p> <p>The Dreamliner is 20% more fuel efficient than comparable wide-bodied aircraft with about 300 seats. It uses carbon fibre composite graphite instead of traditional aluminium.</p> <p>But 50 Dreamliner jets were grounded in January when lithium ion batteries caught fire on two Japanese airlines.</p> <p>They returned to the skies in April but an emergency transmitter on a Boeing 787 caught fire at London's Heathrow airport in July on an Ethiopian Airlines plane.</p> <p>Qantas has ordered 14 Boeing 787s for Jetstar, which are being delivered until late 2015.</p> <p>The Dreamliner deliveries will enable Qantas to take 11 Airbus A330s from Jetstar as part of a plan to retire older, fuel-burning Boeing 767s.</p> <p>Joyce said the lighter Dreamliners would reduce fuel costs in the Qantas group, and help enable the airline to have an even younger fleet than Singapore Airlines \"in the next couple of years, which we haven't seen in a long time\".</p> <p>Jetstar expects to begin commercial flights abroad in November, with limited domestic flights for test purposes, following testing by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in Australia.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419204928|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|a1e60d2f5d9fcb95c5e95f97f38ed876d1e58b11 -->",

        "body":"<p>Retail sales growth eased back last month as clothes stores suffered amid volatile weather, according to new figures.</p><p>BDO's monthly high street tracker showed like-for-like sales across the retail sector, excluding grocery and online sales, increased by 0.6% last month - down sharply on the 3.5% surge recorded in August.  Fashion sales fell 2.1% in September in a \"challenging\" month for clothing retailers as they were buffeted by changeable weather conditions, according to the accountancy and business advisory firm BDO.</p><p>It added that sales progress was held back as many firms chose not to launch heavy discounts in favour of protecting their profits.  Retailers were also up against strong comparatives from a year earlier, when widespread discounting saw sales leap 3.5% higher.</p><p>Don Williams, national head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said: \"September saw a game of nerve being played, with bolder retailers driving footfall and conversion imaginatively rather than resorting solely to price led promotion.\"</p><p>BDO added that retail sales were moving back into a \"more regular pattern of growth\".  Homewares retailers continued to enjoy double digit sales growth, up 12.8%, thanks to Britain's housing market revival, helping non-fashion sales overall rise 3.7%.  Online sales growth slipped to 23.7% from 26.7% in August, the report found.</p><p>BDO tracked sales at around 85 non-grocery retailers with annual sales of between £5m and £500m.</p><p>Official figures showed retail sales volumes fell 0.9% month-on-month in August as spend on food slumped after the barbecue boost from July's heatwave.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192019|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|3caea0ce664d45d534565e2a00a070f15abc1fcd -->",

        "headline":"FTSE 100 companies still 66 female directors short of boardroom target",
        "body":"<p>Concerns continue to be raised about the number of female executives at the top of British business after the latest update on progress towards the government's target of a quarter of the seats in the UK's biggest boardrooms being held by women.</p><p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, said appointing non-executive directors was \"not an end in itself\" as data shows that the main area of progress is in non-executive appointments, with much slower improvement in executive posts.</p><p>The latest half-yearly report on the target set by Lord Davies for FTSE 100 boards to be 25% female by 2015 shows that the proportion of women has increased to 19%, up from 12.5% when the former banker first reported in February 2011.</p><p>Data compiled for the government by Professional Boards Forum BoardWatch shows the proportion of non-executive directors has reached nearly 24% – within a whisker of the Davies target and up from 15.6%. But the proportion of women holding executive positions at FTSE 100 companies is 6.1%, compared with 5.5% when the target was set. The number of all-male boards in the FTSE 100 has risen to six in the past six months, although there were&nbsp;21 all-male boards when the target was set.</p><p>Despite the disparity between non-executive and executive appointments, Cable said the overall total was encouraging. \"We have until 2015 to reach our target of 25% of women on the boards of listed companies which Lord Davies set us two years ago. With today's encouraging figures, I am confident we can get over the finish line. But appointing more women as non-executive directors is not an end in itself. This is about more talented women getting executive experience, so that they will not only advise but run this country's great companies,\" he said.</p><p>Heather Jackson, founder of the Women's Business Forum, which holds its fourth meeting this week, said: \"Simply putting women on boards is a short-term, cosmetic solution. What we really need to be concentrating on is fixing and developing the leaking pipeline of female talent at middle management.\"</p><p>In the FTSE 250, the rung below the FTSE 100, the proportion of female directors is 15%, up from 7.8%, but the proportion of executive directors has fallen to 5.4% from 5.7% – and there are 51 all-male boards. Companies in the FTSE 100 would have to appoint an extra 66 women to reach the 25% target, and the FTSE 250&nbsp;would need to attract an extra 202 women.</p><p>The number of female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies is down to just three: Angela Ahrendts of Burberry, Alison Copper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall of easyJet. Their number has been depleted by the departure of Marjorie Scardino from Pearson and Cynthia Carroll from Anglo American.</p><p>The 30% Club, which campaigns for greater boardroom representation for women, has set up a mentoring scheme to try to channel the \"pipeline\" of women in middle management who might reach the top and push forward more women into executive rules.</p><p>Sir Roger Carr, the City grandee who is scheduled to speak at the Women's Business Forum, said : \"After a fast start, the speed of female board appointments has become more pedestrian. We need to pick up the pace if British business is to benefit from diversity by choice rather than enforcement by quota.\"</p><p>Cable has already written to the bosses of the all-male boardrooms in an attempt to convince them to hire more women. He also appointed former banker Charlotte Sweeney to review the voluntary code of conduct adopted by headhunters who have pledged to ensure women account for 30% of the candidates on long-lists drawn up for company chairman.</p><p>But although some companies are still all male, 31 FTSE 100 companies have reached the 25% target – including betting firm William Hill, advertising group WPP&nbsp;and the National Grid – and 13 have achieved 30% or more, led&nbsp;by drinks&nbsp;group Diageo with 44% and&nbsp;consumer goods group Unilever with&nbsp;36%.</p><p>Davies, a former boss of Standard Chartered and lined up to become a non-executive director of a branch network being spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"We have now moved to a place where it is unacceptable for the voice of women to be absent from the boardroom.\" Davies is leading a consortium that includes the Bank of England that is investing in the 314 branches being sold by RBS and which will eventually be floated off. The shadow board of the branch network, which will be known as Williams &amp; Glyn's, does not contain any women although Davies has said this will be addressed. Cable and his ministers are to hold a series of meetings with FTSE 350 companies to try to tackle this issue.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194784|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|cc811ef2b9a03eaf0369ce72ab744f31da15f9ae -->",

        "headline":"Iceland rises from the ashes of banking collapse",
        "body":"<p>A new mood of proud nationalism is emerging in economically resurgent Iceland after an out-of-control banking system sank the country into financial meltdown exactly five years ago. Riding this wave of confidence is 38-year-old prime minister, Sigmundur Davíd Gunnlaugsson, elected in April on populist promises of mortgage relief for every homeowner.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson earned his spurs in years of outspoken campaigning against the foreign creditors who still haunt Iceland, particularly the British and the Dutch governments, which intervened after the collapse of Landsbanki – the bank behind Icesave – on 7 October 2008.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary British and Dutch savers had previously switched their savings into online Icesave accounts, attracted by market-beating interest rates and promises that: \"You can also rest assured that with Icesave you are offered the same level of financial protection as every bank in the UK.\"</p><p>When the crash came, however, Iceland's deposit guarantee proved worthless, forcing the UK and the Netherlands to use their own taxpayer funds to compensate ordinary savers and sparking a poisonous diplomatic row.</p><p>It was a spat that, against the odds, Iceland won. While many other politicians in Iceland had urged a policy of appeasing the enraged British and Dutch governments, Gunnlaugsson had insisted they should go hang. \"Icelanders, as descendants of the Vikings, are highly individualistic and have difficulty putting up with authorities, let alone oppression,\" he said in one of his first speeches as prime minister on Iceland's Independence Day in June this year.</p><p>\"This was clearly demonstrated in the Icesave dispute, in which the people rejected an agreement they considered unfair. This was later upheld by an international court, which showed that the people's sense of justice was a reliable indicator to follow.\"Having helped win the famous Icesave victory from outside government, Gunnlaugsson has promised to carry that uncompromising approach with him as prime minister, hinting at a new wave of attacks on the interests of foreign creditors to Iceland's three failed banks: Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki. Between them, these institutions had assets more than nine times the size of Iceland's economic output when they failed in 2008.</p><p>From the wreckage, only three modest domestic banks emerged, allowing Iceland to keep functioning. The country was also able to let its overheated currency devalue, and impose capital controls to bring some stability.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, international bondholders and depositors were left out in the cold, waiting to recover what scraps they could from the banks' administration processes. Five years on and they are still waiting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gunnlaugsson's main pre-election pledges were to squeeze these foreign creditors – characterised as \"hedge funds\" or \"vulture funds\" – in order to bankroll a mortgage relief programme for all homeowners and a string of pro-business tax cuts.</p><p>Political opponents savaged the pledge. \"It was like promising to bring back [the boom of] 2007,\" reflects the Left-Green former finance minister Steingrímur Sigfússon. But the Icelandic electorate loved it.</p><p>And with creditors' interests still locked in slow administration processes, and behind tight capital control walls, Gunnlaugsson believes he has a strong hand to play.</p><p>During the election campaign this year, he said: \"This does not revolve around the confiscation of assets. The loss has already been incurred. It was mostly borne by foreign creditors who have recognised the loss and got out. In their place came hedge funds that have profited enormously — on paper — from the collection now of much that was considered lost and written off …</p><p>\"It cannot be accepted that Icelanders should slave away to increase such collections and regain that which had already been lost without getting any share in it.\"</p><p>Creditor groups remain circumspect, keen to get into private discussions with the new administration as quickly as possible. Behind the scenes, however, they are examining their legal options carefully should Gunnlaugsson's aggression go too far. Their goal is to strike a deal that will allow foreign creditors to access more than £9bn of foreign currency assets tied up with the three banks' administrators and barred from exiting Iceland. \"We have been attempting to engage for some time and fail to understand the lack of progress from the authorities,\" said one source close to the creditors.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson's rise to power shocked some observers outside Iceland, who thought the electorate might give their backing to the Left-Green-led coalition that had taken power iafter the banking crash and steered the country through the strictures of an International Monetary Fund programme, and back to growth.</p><p>Instead, the Left-Greens suffered the heaviest defeat in Icelandic history after an election campaign dominated not by economic achievements but by the fallout from the Icesave saga.</p><p>Bouncing back into office came a coalition of the two rightwing parties – the Independence Party and Gunnlaugsson's Progressive party – that had been in charge for much of Iceland's discredited boom years between 2003 and 2008. \"The old rascals are back,\" laughs Geir Haarde, former Independence Party leader and prime minister at the time of the crash.</p><p>The previous government had twice negotiated terms under which Iceland would repay the UK and the Netherlands, with interest, for the cost of bailing out Icesave savers. It was made plain to ministers at the time that continued IMF support depended on such a deal.</p><p>But both proposals, despite being passed by the Icelandic parliament, were overwhelmingly defeated in public referenda thanks in part Gunnlaugsson. Popular opinion in Iceland had railed against what Gunnlaugsson grass roots campaign group InDefence portrayed as bullying forces from overseas, set on extracting reparations from Reykjavik akin to those sought from Germany in the Treaty of Versailles.</p><p>InDefence attacked Britain in particular, accusing Gordon Brown's government of deliberately damaging Iceland's standing in international markets in 2008 by using anti-terrorism laws to freeze the UK assets of Landsbanki. The bank, together with Iceland's finance ministry, was even place on a UK list of financially sanctioned regimes alongside North Korea and al-Qaida.</p><p>As time went on, however, eminent economists began to reassess Iceland's reputation as a pariah state, contrasting it favourably with, among others, Ireland, which had been similarly laid low by an outsized banking sector and forced to seek emergency help from the IMF.</p><p>\"Where everyone else bailed out the bankers and made the public pay the price, Iceland let the banks go bust and actually expanded its social safety net,\" noted Paul Krugman, admiringly. Iceland, he found, had demonstrated the \"case for letting creditors of private banks gone wild eat the losses\".</p><p>Nobel prize winner Joeseph Stilitz agreed. \"What Iceland did was right. It would have been wrong to burden future generations with the mistakes of the financial system.\" For Financial Times economist Martin Wolf too, it was a triumph. \"Iceland let the creditors of its banks hang. Ireland did not. Good for Iceland!\" Less good, of course, for the foreign creditors. And Not all of the foreign creditors are the vulture funds Gunnlaugsson talks of. British and Dutch taxpayers still have significant exposure to the Landsbanki administration. As priority creditors they have had almost 55% of their claims repaid, though the remainder will take a good deal longer to be paid out. There are UK local authorities and charities, too, which entrusted more than £1bn with failed Icelandic banks and are still waiting to get much of their money back. Meanwhile, taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland had been one of the largest investors in Icelandic bank bonds, a position that has left it a non-priority claimant, expecting only minimal returns in its claims.</p><p>Until recently RBS had remained on the banks' creditor lists but sold its positions to distressed debt specialists earlier this year — at a heavy loss — as the outlook for creditors began to look more uncertain in the face of Gunnlaugsson's rising fortunes.</p><p>The Icelandic prime minister has promised to give further details of his populist programme for tax cuts and home loan debt relief next month, and will be under pressure to show how he expects to fund such moves. It remains to be seen if he gains more from squeezing foreign creditors trapped within Iceland's capital controls than he loses in terms of the damage to Iceland's reputation among international investors.</p><p>Last month Gunnlaugsson flew to London to address the Iceland Investment Forum, finishing his speech by declaring: \"Hope to see you, and your money, in Iceland.\"</p><p>The response, from an audience largely of Icelanders and representatives of the foreign creditors, was a ripple of nervous laughter. Gunnlaugsson will not want that laughter to grow any louder.</p><h2>Return to riches</h2><p>Icelanders are fast on their way back to becoming among the richest people in the world, just five years after experiencing one of the most dramatic financial meltdowns in history.</p><p>\"If you say Iceland was a ship, it [the 2008 banking crash] caused a lot of damage to the bridge, but the body of the ship and the engine were still in good order,\" said Geir Haarde, prime minister at the time. He added:  \"Our growth prospects for the future are tremendous.\"</p><p>Haarde's government was ousted three months after the crash in the face of noisy street demonstrations which became known as the \"pots and pans revolution\". A new Left-Green led coalition pushed the country through the strictures of an IMF bailout programme.</p><p>\"We raised almost every tax there was – and introduced new ones,\" recalled the then finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, adding that there were considerable cuts in public spending too as government debt swelled to eye-watering levels.</p><p>By August 2011, Iceland had graduated from its International Monetary Fund bailout programme with flying colours. \"We became a poster child for them,\" suggests Sigfusson, noting how the fund is still struggling to right many other sinking economies on Europe's peripheries.</p><p>Weeks after the IMF exit, a conference was held in Reykjavik, where the mood was close to celebratory. \"As the first country to experience the full force of the global economic crisis,\" the IMF said, \"Iceland is now held up as an example by some of how to overcome deep economic dislocation without undoing the social fabric.\"</p><p>Since then, with government borrowing receding, Iceland has been able to return to the international debt markets, and has begun repaying its emergency loans. Meanwhile, the economy – having shrunk more than 10% in two years – bounced in 2011 and 2012, and will grow by about 1.9% this year.</p><p>Many Icelanders wince at the suggestion that they have escaped lightly from their IMF ordeal. Disposable income fell by a quarter after the crash, and 30,000 people – one-tenth of the population – have fallen into serious loan default; thousands of homes have been repossessed.</p><p>But that is not the whole story. Throughout the crisis, the Icelandic population has maintained the lowest risk of poverty or social exclusion in Europe. Unemployment, which briefly rose to 9.2%, has dropped back to 5.1%. Inflation is falling back to its target range, and house prices in Reykjavik are on the rise. Credit rating agency Fitch gave this assessment of the recovery in February: \"The upgrade reflects the impressive progress Iceland continues to make ... [and] is underpinned by high income-per-capita levels. Rich natural resources, a young population and robust pension assets further support the rating.\"</p><p>Although Iceland has a small population of 317,000, supporting one of the smallest currencies in the world, its resources are mighty in comparison. One in 84 fish caught around the world is caught by Icelandic trawlers in the nation's rich north Atlantic waters. Meanwhile, glacial meltwater powers the nations hydro power stations and, together with geothermal generators, produce electricity five times the requirements of the local population.</p><p>Haarde, who has left politics, says: \"We are used to living quite well. Actually we were only set back a few years. Let's leave aside why this happened, and the blame. When the crisis came to Iceland we were fortunate enough to do what was necessary. The banks never closed, people were able to go to their banks and use their credit cards. There were older people who didn't even realize their had been a crisis.\"</p><p>• This article was amended </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192881|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c2697b791e55f0b29c44cd91675389e488ec8c7f -->",

There are various ways that the US could play for time -- such as prioritising some payments over others, or&nbsp;delaying payments altogether.</p> <p>But officials would soon be forced to implement measures that would hurt growth badly, in a bid to avoid missing a&nbsp;debt repayment and triggering a downgrade to<strong> Selective Default</strong> status.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here's a flavour of the note:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the debt limit is not raised before the Treasury depletes its cash&nbsp;balance, it could force the Treasury to rapidly eliminate the budget&nbsp;deficit to stay under the debt ceiling. We estimate that the fiscal&nbsp;pullback would amount to as much as 4.2% of GDP (annualized). The&nbsp;effect on quarterly growth rates (rather than levels) could be even&nbsp;greater. If this were allowed to occur, it could lead to a rapid downturn&nbsp;in economic activity if not reversed very quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>And more detail....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A very short delay past the&nbsp;October deadline—for instance, a few days—could delay the payment of some obligations&nbsp;already incurred and would create instability in the financial markets. This uncertainty alone could weigh on growth.</p> <p>But a long delay—for example, several weeks—would likely result in a government&nbsp;shutdown much broader than the one that started October 1. In the current shutdown,&nbsp;there is ample cash available to pay for government activities, but the administration has&nbsp;lost its authority to conduct &quot;non-essential&quot; discretionary programs which make up about&nbsp;15% of the federal budget.</p> <p>By contrast, if the debt limit were not increased, after late&nbsp;October the administration would still have authority to make most of its scheduled&nbsp;payments, but would not have enough cash available to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-52527967e4b041f09f138ad5\" class=\"block is-key-event\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-07T10:24:41.487+01:00\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">US deadlock hits euro investors</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1b0128f8-a791-467e-8c2f-2c8feb559585\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/7/1381137864207/c92997d0-b72a-45e4-b1a7-acc6724d5a32-460x264.png\" alt=\"Eurozone investor confidence\" width=\"460\" height=\"264\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Photograph: Sentix</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>The US government shutdown debacle has hit&nbsp;</strong><strong>investor confidence within the eurozone</strong>,&nbsp;according to the latest data from German research firm <strong>Sentix.</strong></p> <p>Sentix's monthly measure of investor sentiment dropped to 6.1, from 6.5 in September.

        "body":"<p>Britain's bankers are feeling increasingly optimistic, as the financial sector reaps the benefits of the upturn in the wider economy.</p><p>In its latest quarterly survey of the industry, business group the CBI says the turnaround in confidence among banks, insurers and City fund managers over the three months to September was the fastest since the mid-1990s. Business volumes at banks fell over the quarter but firms across the sector as a whole told PWC, which compiles the survey, that they expect revenue and profits to increase over the next three months. They are also hiring staff and investing in IT to cope with increased volumes of business.</p><p>Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics, said: \"with optimism rising and jobs and profitability growing, this is an encouraging quarter.\"</p><p>News of the more upbeat mood among City firms echoes a series of other surveys that have added weight to George Osborne's assertion that the UK has, \"turned a corner\".</p><p>City consultancy Capital Economics has revised its UK growth forecasts, upwards after a string of optimistic data. Capital, which expects GDP to expand by 1.5% this year and 2.5% in 2014, rejects the argument that the recovery is based on too much borrowing, or an unsustainable housing bubble.</p><p>\"The housing market has played a minor role in pushing up consumer confidence and consumer spending. And with net mortgage lending close to zero, there is little  evidence that the recovery is built on a renewed accumulation of debt either,\" Capital's analysts say.</p><p>To support the recovery further, the government has announced that it will inject a further £100m into a new batch of Enterprise Zones to boost transport and telecommunications links. The fledgling zones, which began life in 2011 offering tax breaks, looser planning restrictions and infrastructure subsidies, will be consulted from today on the type of infrastructure spending that is most needed over the coming year. New sites in Cheshire, Essex, Cornwall, Gosport, Hereford and the Humber Estuary could bebefit from the extra cash.</p><p>Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: \"The Zones are showing progress with over 180 businesses, £500m of private sector investment and nearly 4,000 jobs, and many more in the pipeline.\"</p><p>\"We want to help them grow further and faster and this extra £100 million investment will ensure they have the infrastructure in place to successfully attract even more businesses and create many more local jobs.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419196150|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|9ee44d81552a1bc1116ecd5db8db9a79912ce8a0 -->",

        "body":"<p>With markets nervous again as the US government shutdown continues and the country's debt ceiling deadline edges ever nearer, it is a UK retailer leading the FTSE 100 fallers.</p><p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> is down nearly 3%, 14p lower at 480p after a downbeat note from Credit Suisse. Analyst Simon Irwin put an underperform rating and 425p price target on the shares, saying:</p><p><blockquote>We believe that the second quarter has been slower than expected for M&amp;S's UK general merchandise so we are cutting second quarter like for like forecasts from +0.5% to -1.5%, and with higher mark-down over the summer and an earlier mid- season sale, we now forecast first half general merchandise gross margin -40 basis points (versus full year guidance +30-50 basis points).<br /><br />While the long-awaited autumn/winter ranges show some signs of improvement we don't not believe they are sufficient to transform like for like sales or margins, over the next year given that the slow migration of supply chain and IT continues to constrain the ability to trade the business. In the mean time, the bulk of the planned £350m of benefits continue to swallowed up (including an additional £100m of depreciation over two years) making it increasingly hard for management to surprise on operating expenditure.<br /><br />Having risen 30% year to date, [the shares] look overbought (as does much of the sector), particularly given the likelihood of further pressure on earnings. <br /></blockquote></p><p>He forecast first half profits of £235m, down 20% year on year:</p><p><blockquote>Although we are not cutting full year forecasts (clean pretax profit of £668m, up 0.5% year on year), first half profits would represent 35% of our full year forecast which compares with an average of 46% over the past 7 years, and second half profits will therefore have to increase by 18% year on year. This is just possible, if everything goes right in general merchandise, food and international. However after three years of steady downgrades, and a relatively wide consensus range, the top end of the range (more than £700m pretax profit) looks set to fall even if management maintain guidance on costs and gross margins.<br /></blockquote></p><p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 54.54 points at 6399.34 as US politicians continue to argue over the budget, ahead of the 17 October deadline for resolving the debt ceiling problem. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:</p><p><blockquote>The congressional stalemate shows no signs of progress with House Speaker Boehner adamant that a clean spending bill will not be approved while Treasury Secretary Lew says congress is playing with fire putting the nation's sovereign reputation at risk, on top of President Obama's highlighting of the potential impact on fourth quarter GDP.<br /><br />There are also fears that October could be a lost month for important official US macro data meaning November lacks a comparable and pushes analysis into December, possibly even January. Rating agency Moody's says US default is extremely unlikely with debt payments being made even after the deadline.<br /><br />With the Fed/markets using data to decide/price in policy changes and tapering, the waters may still remain muddied even after a budget/debt ceiling solution. Fed speakers still making noise (stimulus for longer, can't counter fiscal uncertainty).As we said on Friday, sovereign uncertainty no good, but no tapering until 2014 is risk positive.<br /><br /></blockquote></p><p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> is down 7.1p at 366.1p following r<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3d256baa-2e5b-11e3-be22-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2h1feeXtW\" title=\"\">eports the UK government had sought EU approval if it decides to split RBS into a good and bad bank.</a> <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> is also lower, down 1.42p at 73.49p.</p><p>Among the risers Mexican miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> has added 10p to 923.5p after UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy, saying recent share price weakness made the company attractive.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419232945|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|dcf9bc06462581a78d8d29862d2e28d808fb1a01 -->",

        "headline":"Help to Buy: demand may outstrip supply as lenders brace for stampede",
        "body":"<p>More than 600,000 homes on the market are eligible for inclusion in the £12bn second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, according to the latest in a series of surveys leading to predictions that lenders will be flooded by pent-up demand for the government-backed mortgages.</p><p>Details of the 95% mortgages, which are available to existing homeowners as well as first-time buyers, are to be unveiled by the chancellor , with some banks expected to invite loan applications within hours of the Tuesday announcement. The second phase of the flagship scheme to give more first-time buyers and others wider access to the housing market was brought forward by three months, with a report from high street bank Santander claiming that up to 1.7 million people are planning to use the scheme.</p><p>\"It is going to accelerate more people going into the market, so the number of mortgage applications will increase and that will put more pressure on lenders and their [loan] processing,\" said David Hollingsworth of broker London &amp; Country Mortgages. \"But in terms of gross [mortgage] lending we are about less than half where we were in 2007.\"</p><p>Another mortgage broker predicted a surge in demand, stoked by media coverage of the scheme, that could be blunted by stringent eligibility checks from lenders. \"A lot of people want to get on the property ladder and the lenders who come out with these products will be inundated with inquiries,\" said Andrew Montlake of Coreco. \"But lenders are not going to suddenly forget about being prudent, so people are going to have to qualify for the loans.\"</p><p>Under this part of the Help to Buy scheme, buyers will need a minimum deposit of 5%, equivalent to about £10,000 for eligible homes in most regions of England and Wales. The government guarantees the next 15% of the property's value. The scheme is designed to encourage banks and building societies to offer more, and cheaper, mortgages, to people who can only manage relatively small deposits to secure a property.</p><p>Unlike some previous government home-buying initiatives, this one covers existing homes as well as new-build properties. Ministers have claimed it could assist more than 500,000 buyers over three years.</p><p>The level of interest rates that will be offered has yet to emerge, but banks have indicated that would-be buyers should not expect cheaper mortgages.</p><p>The Treasury is also likely to charge more to effectively insure loans to borrowers with the smallest deposits. Assuming the banks pass on the charges it means first-time buyers are still likely to face higher mortgage fees and interest rates than those borrowing to move house. Lenders are expected to charge rates of around 5% for the Help to Buy mortgages. Despite those reservations, mortgage commentators have expressed fears of a stampede for new applications. Research published on Friday found that two-thirds of adults under the age of 30 planned to buy their first home or move house during the three-year lifetime of Help to Buy.</p><p>The data, from the broker called the Mortgage Advice Bureau, also found that 20% of young adults said they were more likely to buy due to the scheme.</p><p>The property website Zoopla.co.uk has estimated that there are about 665,000 properties now on sale that are eligible for the second phase of Help to Buy. The scheme applies to any home up to a value of £600,000. Zoopla said that the average minimum deposit required to buy an eligible property was less than £10,000 in six of 10 regions in England and Wales: north-west and north-east England, the east and west Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and Wales. With the average asking price standing at £222,168, the required 5% deposit would be £11,108. But in London, where prices have been rising the fastest in the country in recent months, the figure would be £16,100.</p><p>Under the second part of Help to Buy, the government is making available £12bn of guarantees to lenders, though just three banking brands have indicated they will be offering the new deals from the outset: these are Royal Bank of Scotland, its NatWest arm, and Halifax.</p><p>RBS and NatWest said that from the launch date of the scheme customers would be able to visit any of their 2,000 branches or phone for advice. They added that opening hours would be extended at more than 740 branches across England, Scotland and Wales \"to help with customer demand\".</p><p>Estate agents and mortgage brokers have reported an increase in inquiries from buyers. Peter Rollings, chief executive of the London-based estate agent Marsh &amp; Parsons, said the new phase of Help to Buy would be \"like a shot of adrenalin\". He said of the London market: \"The capital needs this stimulus to free up mid-ladder buyers who want to become first-time sellers. This will create a much healthier balance between supply and demand.\"</p><p>Many experts have argued that the government should ditch the second phase of Help to Buy, because they fear it will artificially inflate house prices too much by ramping up demand at a faster rate than the supply of homes coming on the UK market. Mortgage availability has become more widespread following the launch of the government's funding for lending scheme in August last year, giving lenders access to cheap finance in order to help borrowers. The first phase of Help to Buy provides equity loans but only applies to purchasers of new-build properties. The government has brought forward the second phase of Help to Buy despite opposition from within the coalition, including from backbench Conservatives.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419198803|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|68f5cf5b86994d484ac8e3969bc85d98e5d122cd -->",

        "headline":"FTSE 100 companies still 66 female directors short of boardroom target",
        "body":"<p>Concerns continue to be raised about the number of female executives at the top of British business after the latest update on progress towards the government's target of a quarter of the seats in the UK's biggest boardrooms being held by women.</p><p>The business secretary, Vince Cable, said appointing non-executive directors was \"not an end in itself\" as data shows that the main area of progress is in non-executive appointments, with much slower improvement in executive posts.</p><p>The latest half-yearly report on the target set by Lord Davies for FTSE 100 boards to be 25% female by 2015 shows that the proportion of women has increased to 19%, up from 12.5% when the former banker first reported in February 2011.</p><p>Data compiled for the government by Professional Boards Forum BoardWatch shows the proportion of non-executive directors has reached nearly 24% – within a whisker of the Davies target and up from 15.6%. But the proportion of women holding executive positions at FTSE 100 companies is 6.1%, compared with 5.5% when the target was set. The number of all-male boards in the FTSE 100 has risen to six in the past six months, although there were&nbsp;21 all-male boards when the target was set.</p><p>Despite the disparity between non-executive and executive appointments, Cable said the overall total was encouraging. \"We have until 2015 to reach our target of 25% of women on the boards of listed companies which Lord Davies set us two years ago. With today's encouraging figures, I am confident we can get over the finish line. But appointing more women as non-executive directors is not an end in itself. This is about more talented women getting executive experience, so that they will not only advise but run this country's great companies,\" he said.</p><p>Heather Jackson, founder of the Women's Business Forum, which holds its fourth meeting this week, said: \"Simply putting women on boards is a short-term, cosmetic solution. What we really need to be concentrating on is fixing and developing the leaking pipeline of female talent at middle management.\"</p><p>In the FTSE 250, the rung below the FTSE 100, the proportion of female directors is 15%, up from 7.8%, but the proportion of executive directors has fallen to 5.4% from 5.7% – and there are 51 all-male boards. Companies in the FTSE 100 would have to appoint an extra 66 women to reach the 25% target, and the FTSE 250&nbsp;would need to attract an extra 202 women.</p><p>The number of female chief executives of FTSE 100 companies is down to just three: Angela Ahrendts of Burberry, Alison Copper at Imperial Tobacco and Carolyn McCall of easyJet. Their number has been depleted by the departure of Marjorie Scardino from Pearson and Cynthia Carroll from Anglo American.</p><p>The 30% Club, which campaigns for greater boardroom representation for women, has set up a mentoring scheme to try to channel the \"pipeline\" of women in middle management who might reach the top and push forward more women into executive rules.</p><p>Sir Roger Carr, the City grandee who is scheduled to speak at the Women's Business Forum, said : \"After a fast start, the speed of female board appointments has become more pedestrian. We need to pick up the pace if British business is to benefit from diversity by choice rather than enforcement by quota.\"</p><p>Cable has already written to the bosses of the all-male boardrooms in an attempt to convince them to hire more women. He also appointed former banker Charlotte Sweeney to review the voluntary code of conduct adopted by headhunters who have pledged to ensure women account for 30% of the candidates on long-lists drawn up for company chairman.</p><p>But although some companies are still all male, 31 FTSE 100 companies have reached the 25% target – including betting firm William Hill, advertising group WPP&nbsp;and the National Grid – and 13 have achieved 30% or more, led&nbsp;by drinks&nbsp;group Diageo with 44% and&nbsp;consumer goods group Unilever with&nbsp;36%.</p><p>Davies, a former boss of Standard Chartered and lined up to become a non-executive director of a branch network being spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"We have now moved to a place where it is unacceptable for the voice of women to be absent from the boardroom.\" Davies is leading a consortium that includes the Bank of England that is investing in the 314 branches being sold by RBS and which will eventually be floated off. The shadow board of the branch network, which will be known as Williams &amp; Glyn's, does not contain any women although Davies has said this will be addressed. Cable and his ministers are to hold a series of meetings with FTSE 350 companies to try to tackle this issue.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419194784|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|cc811ef2b9a03eaf0369ce72ab744f31da15f9ae -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Populist programme of new government includes a squeeze on foreign creditors as country emerges from years of instability</p>",
        "headline":"Iceland rises from the ashes of banking collapse",
        "body":"<p>A new mood of proud nationalism is emerging in economically resurgent Iceland after an out-of-control banking system sank the country into financial meltdown exactly five years ago. Riding this wave of confidence is 38-year-old prime minister, Sigmundur Davíd Gunnlaugsson, elected in April on populist promises of mortgage relief for every homeowner.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson earned his spurs in years of outspoken campaigning against the foreign creditors who still haunt Iceland, particularly the British and the Dutch governments, which intervened after the collapse of Landsbanki – the bank behind Icesave – on 7 October 2008.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary British and Dutch savers had previously switched their savings into online Icesave accounts, attracted by market-beating interest rates and promises that: \"You can also rest assured that with Icesave you are offered the same level of financial protection as every bank in the UK.\"</p><p>When the crash came, however, Iceland's deposit guarantee proved worthless, forcing the UK and the Netherlands to use their own taxpayer funds to compensate ordinary savers and sparking a poisonous diplomatic row.</p><p>It was a spat that, against the odds, Iceland won. While many other politicians in Iceland had urged a policy of appeasing the enraged British and Dutch governments, Gunnlaugsson had insisted they should go hang. \"Icelanders, as descendants of the Vikings, are highly individualistic and have difficulty putting up with authorities, let alone oppression,\" he said in one of his first speeches as prime minister on Iceland's Independence Day in June this year.</p><p>\"This was clearly demonstrated in the Icesave dispute, in which the people rejected an agreement they considered unfair. This was later upheld by an international court, which showed that the people's sense of justice was a reliable indicator to follow.\"Having helped win the famous Icesave victory from outside government, Gunnlaugsson has promised to carry that uncompromising approach with him as prime minister, hinting at a new wave of attacks on the interests of foreign creditors to Iceland's three failed banks: Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki. Between them, these institutions had assets more than nine times the size of Iceland's economic output when they failed in 2008.</p><p>From the wreckage, only three modest domestic banks emerged, allowing Iceland to keep functioning. The country was also able to let its overheated currency devalue, and impose capital controls to bring some stability.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, international bondholders and depositors were left out in the cold, waiting to recover what scraps they could from the banks' administration processes. Five years on and they are still waiting.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gunnlaugsson's main pre-election pledges were to squeeze these foreign creditors – characterised as \"hedge funds\" or \"vulture funds\" – in order to bankroll a mortgage relief programme for all homeowners and a string of pro-business tax cuts.</p><p>Political opponents savaged the pledge. \"It was like promising to bring back [the boom of] 2007,\" reflects the Left-Green former finance minister Steingrímur Sigfússon. But the Icelandic electorate loved it.</p><p>And with creditors' interests still locked in slow administration processes, and behind tight capital control walls, Gunnlaugsson believes he has a strong hand to play.</p><p>During the election campaign this year, he said: \"This does not revolve around the confiscation of assets. The loss has already been incurred. It was mostly borne by foreign creditors who have recognised the loss and got out. In their place came hedge funds that have profited enormously — on paper — from the collection now of much that was considered lost and written off …</p><p>\"It cannot be accepted that Icelanders should slave away to increase such collections and regain that which had already been lost without getting any share in it.\"</p><p>Creditor groups remain circumspect, keen to get into private discussions with the new administration as quickly as possible. Behind the scenes, however, they are examining their legal options carefully should Gunnlaugsson's aggression go too far. Their goal is to strike a deal that will allow foreign creditors to access more than £9bn of foreign currency assets tied up with the three banks' administrators and barred from exiting Iceland. \"We have been attempting to engage for some time and fail to understand the lack of progress from the authorities,\" said one source close to the creditors.</p><p>Gunnlaugsson's rise to power shocked some observers outside Iceland, who thought the electorate might give their backing to the Left-Green-led coalition that had taken power iafter the banking crash and steered the country through the strictures of an International Monetary Fund programme, and back to growth.</p><p>Instead, the Left-Greens suffered the heaviest defeat in Icelandic history after an election campaign dominated not by economic achievements but by the fallout from the Icesave saga.</p><p>Bouncing back into office came a coalition of the two rightwing parties – the Independence Party and Gunnlaugsson's Progressive party – that had been in charge for much of Iceland's discredited boom years between 2003 and 2008. \"The old rascals are back,\" laughs Geir Haarde, former Independence Party leader and prime minister at the time of the crash.</p><p>The previous government had twice negotiated terms under which Iceland would repay the UK and the Netherlands, with interest, for the cost of bailing out Icesave savers. It was made plain to ministers at the time that continued IMF support depended on such a deal.</p><p>But both proposals, despite being passed by the Icelandic parliament, were overwhelmingly defeated in public referenda thanks in part Gunnlaugsson. Popular opinion in Iceland had railed against what Gunnlaugsson grass roots campaign group InDefence portrayed as bullying forces from overseas, set on extracting reparations from Reykjavik akin to those sought from Germany in the Treaty of Versailles.</p><p>InDefence attacked Britain in particular, accusing Gordon Brown's government of deliberately damaging Iceland's standing in international markets in 2008 by using anti-terrorism laws to freeze the UK assets of Landsbanki. The bank, together with Iceland's finance ministry, was even place on a UK list of financially sanctioned regimes alongside North Korea and al-Qaida.</p><p>As time went on, however, eminent economists began to reassess Iceland's reputation as a pariah state, contrasting it favourably with, among others, Ireland, which had been similarly laid low by an outsized banking sector and forced to seek emergency help from the IMF.</p><p>\"Where everyone else bailed out the bankers and made the public pay the price, Iceland let the banks go bust and actually expanded its social safety net,\" noted Paul Krugman, admiringly. Iceland, he found, had demonstrated the \"case for letting creditors of private banks gone wild eat the losses\".</p><p>Nobel prize winner Joeseph Stilitz agreed. \"What Iceland did was right. It would have been wrong to burden future generations with the mistakes of the financial system.\" For Financial Times economist Martin Wolf too, it was a triumph. \"Iceland let the creditors of its banks hang. Ireland did not. Good for Iceland!\" Less good, of course, for the foreign creditors. And Not all of the foreign creditors are the vulture funds Gunnlaugsson talks of. British and Dutch taxpayers still have significant exposure to the Landsbanki administration. As priority creditors they have had almost 55% of their claims repaid, though the remainder will take a good deal longer to be paid out. There are UK local authorities and charities, too, which entrusted more than £1bn with failed Icelandic banks and are still waiting to get much of their money back. Meanwhile, taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland had been one of the largest investors in Icelandic bank bonds, a position that has left it a non-priority claimant, expecting only minimal returns in its claims.</p><p>Until recently RBS had remained on the banks' creditor lists but sold its positions to distressed debt specialists earlier this year — at a heavy loss — as the outlook for creditors began to look more uncertain in the face of Gunnlaugsson's rising fortunes.</p><p>The Icelandic prime minister has promised to give further details of his populist programme for tax cuts and home loan debt relief next month, and will be under pressure to show how he expects to fund such moves. It remains to be seen if he gains more from squeezing foreign creditors trapped within Iceland's capital controls than he loses in terms of the damage to Iceland's reputation among international investors.</p><p>Last month Gunnlaugsson flew to London to address the Iceland Investment Forum, finishing his speech by declaring: \"Hope to see you, and your money, in Iceland.\"</p><p>The response, from an audience largely of Icelanders and representatives of the foreign creditors, was a ripple of nervous laughter. Gunnlaugsson will not want that laughter to grow any louder.</p><h2>Return to riches</h2><p>Icelanders are fast on their way back to becoming among the richest people in the world, just five years after experiencing one of the most dramatic financial meltdowns in history.</p><p>\"If you say Iceland was a ship, it [the 2008 banking crash] caused a lot of damage to the bridge, but the body of the ship and the engine were still in good order,\" said Geir Haarde, prime minister at the time. He added:  \"Our growth prospects for the future are tremendous.\"</p><p>Haarde's government was ousted three months after the crash in the face of noisy street demonstrations which became known as the \"pots and pans revolution\". A new Left-Green led coalition pushed the country through the strictures of an IMF bailout programme.</p><p>\"We raised almost every tax there was – and introduced new ones,\" recalled the then finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, adding that there were considerable cuts in public spending too as government debt swelled to eye-watering levels.</p><p>By August 2011, Iceland had graduated from its International Monetary Fund bailout programme with flying colours. \"We became a poster child for them,\" suggests Sigfusson, noting how the fund is still struggling to right many other sinking economies on Europe's peripheries.</p><p>Weeks after the IMF exit, a conference was held in Reykjavik, where the mood was close to celebratory. \"As the first country to experience the full force of the global economic crisis,\" the IMF said, \"Iceland is now held up as an example by some of how to overcome deep economic dislocation without undoing the social fabric.\"</p><p>Since then, with government borrowing receding, Iceland has been able to return to the international debt markets, and has begun repaying its emergency loans. Meanwhile, the economy – having shrunk more than 10% in two years – bounced in 2011 and 2012, and will grow by about 1.9% this year.</p><p>Many Icelanders wince at the suggestion that they have escaped lightly from their IMF ordeal. Disposable income fell by a quarter after the crash, and 30,000 people – one-tenth of the population – have fallen into serious loan default; thousands of homes have been repossessed.</p><p>But that is not the whole story. Throughout the crisis, the Icelandic population has maintained the lowest risk of poverty or social exclusion in Europe. Unemployment, which briefly rose to 9.2%, has dropped back to 5.1%. Inflation is falling back to its target range, and house prices in Reykjavik are on the rise. Credit rating agency Fitch gave this assessment of the recovery in February: \"The upgrade reflects the impressive progress Iceland continues to make ... [and] is underpinned by high income-per-capita levels. Rich natural resources, a young population and robust pension assets further support the rating.\"</p><p>Although Iceland has a small population of 317,000, supporting one of the smallest currencies in the world, its resources are mighty in comparison. One in 84 fish caught around the world is caught by Icelandic trawlers in the nation's rich north Atlantic waters. Meanwhile, glacial meltwater powers the nations hydro power stations and, together with geothermal generators, produce electricity five times the requirements of the local population.</p><p>Haarde, who has left politics, says: \"We are used to living quite well. Actually we were only set back a few years. Let's leave aside why this happened, and the blame. When the crisis came to Iceland we were fortunate enough to do what was necessary. The banks never closed, people were able to go to their banks and use their credit cards. There were older people who didn't even realize their had been a crisis.\"</p><p>• This article was amended </p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192881|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c2697b791e55f0b29c44cd91675389e488ec8c7f -->",

        "headline":"Royal Mail shares expected to soar as Labour warns taxpayers short-changed",
        "body":"<p>Investors in the Royal Mail selloff stand to generate an instant return of at least 12% on their investment if trading matches current speculation on grey markets, according to City experts.</p><p>Labour has stepped up demands for the government to pull the plug on the privatisation before applications for shares close on Tuesday evening, warning that taxpayers will be shortchanged in a \"bonanza for City speculators\".</p><p>The government is set to offer shares at a price of between 260p and 330p, valuing the company at up to £3.3bn.</p><p>But according to City spread betting firm IG Group, demand from speculators is likely to push share prices to between 370p and 390p when stock market trading opens.</p><p>David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, which has been running a grey market for retail investors for three weeks, said: \"We started quoting at £2.5bn and it's been pushed up to £3.8bn. Our price is being driven purely by our clients' activity.\"</p><p>He said that activity suggested prices would rise on the first day of trading to between 370p and 390p – a 12-18% profit even if the offer price were set at the maximum 330p, adding: \"This looks like an instant windfall to everybody.\"</p><p>The offer price will be announced on Thursday at 7am. Although it is widely expected now to be at least 300p a share, a host of City analysts say even that will undervalue the Royal Mail, in what is the biggest privatisation since the selloff of the railways in the 1990s. Gert Zonneveld, managing director of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, has said he believes the true value of Royal Mail could prove to be up to £4.5bn, while stockbroker ETX Capital said exceptional demand from retail investors would drive the shares as high as 365p on the first day.</p><p>Applications for shares close at a minute to midnight on Tuesday evening. Potential investors placed orders covering all the shares on offer within hours of the sale launching last week. Stockbrokers kept offices open through the weekend to field calls from smaller private investors, with the public able to buy shares when investing £750 upwards.</p><p>Around 60% of the company will be sold off, with 10% handed to employees and the government retaining at least a 30% shareholding.</p><p>Institutional investors will be allowed to trade shares conditionally from Friday, while retail shareholders – ordinary members of the public –  can potentially sell shares as soon as they are listed on the stock market on 15 October. Shares issued to employees are locked in for three years.</p><p>The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \"It is not too late for the govemnment to pull the plug on this privatisation which appears to be about to deliver a huge bonanza for City speculators at the same time that it is massively shortchanging taxpayers.\"</p><p>Labour believes that the Royal Mail's property assets alone, including prime central London sites now regarded as surplus to requiremets, could be sold for billions.</p><p>The Communication Workers Union says the overwhelming majority of postal workers oppose the deal. A ballot for strike action may lead to a walkout later this month.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Royal Mail spokesman said that reports that the newly privatised firm would pay no corporation tax for a decade were \"entirely speculative\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192934|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|1b965c7e9d277d6cf7b8497625a9941011607960 -->",

Japan Airlines has the option to buy a further 25.</p><p>It is a significant win for Airbus and the A350, which is designed to be more fuel efficient. The aircraft is a direct competitor of Boeing's Dreamliner, which has been bit by safety and technical issues this year.</p><p>Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines (JAL), said the A350 fleet would allow the company to take advantage of \"new business opportunities after slots at airports in Tokyo are increased\".</p><p>The new JAL Airbus fleet is scheduled to be operational from 2019, gradually replacing its ageing fleet over a six-year period.</p><p>Of the 31 aircraft ordered, 18 will be A350-900s, which typically offer three classes of seating and carry more than 300 passengers.</p><p>The remaining 13 will be A350-1000s, which seat 350 passengers on longer flights.</p><p>Fabrice Bregier, the Airbus president and chief executive, said the order marked a \"new chapter\" for the aircraft maker in Japan.</p><p>Airbus has now received orders for more than 750 A350s from 38 customers worldwide and it is hoped that the first of the new aircraft will be ready for commercial service in the second half of 2014.</p><p>News of the order was also welcomed by British company Rolls-Royce, which will supply its Trent engine for all 31 aircraft.</p><p>In a separate announcement Rolls said it had won two contracts, with a combined value of up to $496m, to support T56 engines on US government aircraft.</p><p>Under the six-year contract the FTSE 100 company will supply parts and field and engineering support for thousands of T56 engines, which have been in production since the 1950s.</p><p>The contract, awarded by the Defence Logistics Agency, will support around 1,000 C-130, P-3 and C-2 aircraft in service with the US Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Customs and Border Control as well as international fleets.</p><p>Rolls was also handed a contract worth up to $90m by the US Navy, involving engine repairs for E-2 Hawkeye aircraft, which are powered by two T56-A-427 engines.</p><p>The five-year contract is renewable annually and is valued at $17m for the first year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419229282|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b55752f7523e1c4af8dedf7325bdbbbee9906b07 -->",

        "body":"<p>October 1973. England versus Poland at Wembley. Only a win would ensure England's participation in the World Cup finals.</p><p>The 1-1 draw on that misty autumn evening signalled the end of Alf Ramsey's reign as England manager. It took place against the backdrop of a war in the Middle East that marked the end of postwar abundance.</p><p>The war began on 6 October 1973 when Israel was celebrating the holy day of Yom Kippur and was over by the end of the month, with initial gains by the coalition of Arab states quickly reversed. The oil cartel Opec announced supply restrictions leading to energy shortages in the US. In Britain, the Yom Kippur war added to the problems of a Conservative government trying to control an already overheating economy with a prices and incomes policy. By Christmas, Britain was preparing for a three-day week.</p><p>The Yom Kippur war lasted less than a month but its effects lasted four decades. It marked the end of a certain way of looking at the world, namely that the problems of production had been resolved and that policymaking was about how the fruits of growth were shared between capital and labour, between private and public sectors, and between consumption and investment.</p><p>In truth, there had been signs of problems well before the autumn of 1973. One critique came from the fledgling environmental movement, which said the fixation on growth was dangerous. The bible of the movement, Small is Beautiful by Fritz Schumacher, was published in 1973.</p><p>The other critique was from those who said the golden age was something of a historical aberration made possible by the massive scope for expansion from the output losses in the second world war. Free-marketeers argued that higher spending on welfare, excessive pay awards demanded by organised labour and punitive taxes were stifling capitalism. This critique was provided with real traction by the oil crisis of 1973.</p><p>Cheap crude had been a key factor in the long boom and the Opec embargo increased oil prices fourfold by the end of the year. Dearer energy pushed up business costs and reduced the disposable incomes of workers. Simultaneously inflationary and deflationary, it resulted in a new word entering the lexicon of economics: stagflation.</p><p>Initially, there were attempts by politicians of the centre right and centre left to keep the show on the road. This group – Jim Callaghan in Britain, Helmut Schmidt in Germany, Gerald Ford in the US, Valéry Giscard D'Estaing in France – had come of age as statesmen in the good years but developed a more muscular approach to economic management as a result of the oil shock. Callaghan's repudiation of Keynesianism and the shift at the Treasury to an early form of monetarism were examples of the new mood.</p><p>This, though, proved to be a staging post – in the US and Britain at least – to a wholly different way of looking at the world. Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in America believed in market forces, financial deregulation, lower taxes, weak trade unions and less intrusive government.</p><p>Yet the results of this revolution have been distinctly mixed. Not only has growth been slower than it was in the so-called golden age, it has been less evenly distributed. Boom and bust has been a feature of the past four decades in a way that it wasn't in the quarter century from 1948 to 1973. And while the assault on trade unions certainly weakened the power of organised labour, the upshot has been that workers have struggled to secure as big a share of growth as they did in the 1950s and 1960s. Consumption patterns have become more dependent on easy credit from deregulated finance generating higher asset prices. Until the recent crisis, this ensured that there was no repeat of the falling living standards seen in the mid to late 1970s.</p><p>Nor is it entirely obvious that market forces reign supreme or that government has become less intrusive. It is perhaps more accurate to say that public sector monopolies have been replaced by private sector oligopolies that can fix prices and rock the consumer. And while the government no longer owns a large chunk of British industry, it has found other ways to be intrusive. The surveillance state is alive and well.</p><p>In his new book, the investment banker Daniel Alpert says the world is suffering from oversupply. This has been generated from the biggest change of all in the past 40 years: the spread of the market economy to all corners of the globe; to China, to India and to the former Soviet Union.</p><p>The world economy has more than enough labour, productive capacity and capital to meet current levels of demand. The result has been downward pressure on wages in developed countries and financial bubbles caused by the huge current account surpluses of developing countries being recycled through western financial markets.</p><p>Alpert argues that unlike in the aftermath of the second world war there were no new institutions developed to manage a changing global economy, nothing to resemble the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Nor has there been any significant change in economic thinking.</p><p>The crisis of 2008-09 demonstrated the deficiencies of the model that emerged from the wreckage of the golden age in the 1970s. In 1973, the symptoms of trouble were falling profitability, industrial unrest and a rising cost of living. Today they are falling real wages, excessively high levels of debt and a dysfunctional financial system.</p><p>Policymakers have been struggling for five years to put the show back on the road. There is a growing sense of public unease that things are not as they should be, although there has been no swing to the left in the way that there was a swing to the right four decades ago. The half decade since the collapse of Lehman Brothers has been chastening for those who imagined the near-collapse of the world's financial system would lead to a seismic shift in the political landscape. In part, that's because support for the status quo is stronger than it was in 1973, since those at the top of the pile have most to lose from change. In part, it's because there was an ideological vacuum when the financial markets crashed.</p><p>So instead of a fundamental rethink of how to manage the age of oversupply, the approach is to assume nothing fundamental is wrong and that given time and a bit of luck the good times will return. Pretty much what every England manager since Alf Ramsey has said, in fact.</p><p><em>• </em><a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241003794,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Age of Oversupply by Daniel Alpert; Penguin, £14.99</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419187267|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|ffbac8bda83b71a1586429c72652c5d88b2003e2 -->",

It is thought the group may look to launch its initial public offering early next year and could be valued at between £300m and £400m.</p><p>A growing list of companies are mulling flotations to tap into buoyant financial markets, including sofa retailer DFS, Madame Tussauds owner Merlin Entertainments and online takeaway service Just Eat.  House of Fraser's IPO would mark a return to the stock market for the group after an absence of more than seven years.</p><p>The 161-year-old business has had a tumultuous time since the financial crisis, with 49% of the group owned by representatives of failed Icelandic banks, who took control of the shares when previous owner Baugur went bust.</p><p>Executive chairman Don McCarthy and his family also hold a 20% stake. Other big shareholders include Scottish tycoon Tom Hunter and Lloyds Banking Group, which inherited its stake after HBOS helped finance Baugur's takeover deal.</p><p>The retailer generates sales of £1.2bn a year and employs 7,300 people, as well as 12,000 concession staff.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419192091|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|2a7418efbb9c911afe85c33fc5d10bb983a40c56 -->",

        "body":"<p>Britain's largest trade union has called for an emergency summit and parliamentary debate in a bid to avert strikes at an oil refinery and petrochemical site in Scotland. Workers at the Ineos site in Grangemouth started an overtime ban and work-to-rule  on Sunday in support of a Unite union convenor, Stevie Deans. He was suspended, then reinstated, by the company over his involvement in the selection of a Labour candidate in Falkirk, where he is chairman of the local constituency party. He remains under investigation by the company.</p><p>Unite accused Ineos of trying to provoke a strike, which it warned would be hugely damaging to the UK economy.  Workers have voted heavily in favour of action up to and including a strike – and Unite officials said they had not ruled out calling for a walkout.</p><p>Pat Rafferty, the union's Scottish regional secretary, said that the company was using the Deans dispute as an excuse to introduce sweeping reforms, including pension changes and job losses.</p><p>Unite called for a summit with the company and politicians. It also urged the Scottish government to hold an emergency debate to help prevent the dispute escalating. \"The changes being proposed are completely unpalatable to us and we feel we are being pushed into taking strike action,\" Rafferty said. Unite said the work-to-rule and overtime ban would slow down maintenance work at Grangemouth, which is split into refinery and petrochemical operations.</p><p>The company has warned that the site will close by 2017 without new investment and savings in running costs.</p><p>Ineos has put forward a survival plan and has asked the Scottish and UK governments for grants and loan guarantees totalling £150m.</p><p>Chairman Calum MacLean has warned \"there is no plan B\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419193626|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|24c526a483aab76dbb1e7d7797126f693f885070 -->",

        "body":"<p>Online retailer Amazon may be facing strike action in Germany in the run-up to Christmas. The secretary of the German services union Verdi has told Der Spiegel magazine that Amazon \"shouldn't rely on being able to keep all their promises to customers before Christmas\" and that the union would call strikes when it would hurt the company most.</p><p>Germany has had strikes by Amazon employees this year over wages. In June and September several hundred workers at the US company's distribution centres in Leipzig, Saxony and Bad Hersfeld in the Hesse region  walked out. Verdi has around 2.2 million members and has said it wants to force Amazon to negotiate a collective wage agreement that complies with standards in the German retail sector. Amazon claims that the wages it pays are above average in the logistics industry. \"Job descriptions for staff are typical of the logistics industry such as the storage, packaging and dispatch of goods,\" a spokeswoman for Amazon Germany told Reuters. The spokeswoman added that the strikes in June and September had not affected customers.</p><p>There is so far no detail on whether the strikes are planned again for the centres in Leipzig or Bad Hersfeld, or any other of the eight distribution centres in Germany.Amazon employs more than 9,000 in Germany but is reportedly considering opening five new centres in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189783|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|8981b80d025f3ec2f994a318c112fab0dfcaea79 -->",

        "headline":"Energy lobby insiders will lead cold war against Labour",
        "body":"<p>ScottishPower, one of the UK's big six energy companies, turned up the public heat on Labour leader Ed Miliband last week by warning that investment in new power stations will be endangered by his plans for a price freeze.</p><p>But it was not just Labour that was coming under pressure. The industry's considerable lobbying powers were acknowledged at the Conservative party conference when the energy minister, Michael Fallon, referred to the sector's trade body, <a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/press-releases/energy-uk-response-to-ed-miliband-labour-conference-speech.html\" title=\"\">Energy UK</a>, as \"one of the strongest and most well-argued lobbies there is\".</p><p>But the real lobbying is going on behind the scenes, where the major players have a large network of individuals defending the sector's interests.</p><p>Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer at ScottishPower, told Miliband in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/01/scottish-power-energy-bills-uk-investment-ed-miliband\" title=\"\">a letter released to the media</a> that a freeze would foment doubts and create an atmosphere that would affect \"the appetite to invest\".</p><p>But Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, was later <a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/press-releases/energy-uk-response-to-ed-miliband-labour-conference-speech.html\" title=\"\">peddling a more low-key line</a>: \"We need a calm, considered debate and want to engage all parties and consumers in the discussion.\"</p><p>The Labour party is wary of Knight, a former Conservative MP and until little more than a year ago chief executive of the British Bankers' Association. Bilateral talks are expected to take place&nbsp;between Miliband and each of the big six companies, with Knight kept at a distance.</p><p>And one public relations adviser to the power companies said privately that the big six would now begin a behind-the-scenes cold war, rather than continue the open hostility: \"It would be a big mistake to wage a big campaign against this. It would make them look even more like pantomime villains than they already do. Instead, they will work quietly to do their very best, aided by the Murdoch press and others, to make sure Labour does not get in.\"</p><p>The firms would also use the employees they have already placed on secondments in the heart of government, and their scores of public affairs experts, to reinforce the carefully cultivated impression that they were indispensable to the government's plans to create a low-carbon energy system, sources said.</p><p>\"The Department of Energy and Climate Change [Decc] is under the strong impression that it cannot do the things it wants to do without the big six – it just simply doesn't believe it is possible,\" another lobbyist said.</p><p>Current government policy, developed by the Conservatives while in opposition, was heavily influenced by two of the big six – EDF and British Gas-owner Centrica – according to industry sources: \"EDF and Centrica are now just an offshoot of Decc – they are all so in bed with each other they are indistinguishable.\"</p><p>It was Centrica's chairman, Sir Roger Carr, who was most aggressive in his comments following the Miliband speech, arguing that a price freeze would lead to \"economic ruin\". Equally, Centrica is one of only three big six firms that has yet to respond formally to a Labour letter setting out its policy of a 20-month price freeze if Miliband were to win the 2015 general election.</p><p>After the 2010 election, Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, was appointed to David Cameron's business advisory council, while the prime minister's current energy adviser in Downing Street, Tara Singh, is a former Centrica employee. The source suggested that the same help in writing policy would be offered to Labour.</p><p>Energy companies, including Centrica, EDF and RWE npower, have placed dozens of staff in government departments on secondments since 2008, either funded by the taxpayer or provided for nothing. (Civil servants also travel in the opposite direction and spend time in energy companies.) By the end of 2012 almost two dozen were in place in the energy department.</p><p>Tom Burke, a former head of Friends of the Earth who worked as special adviser to several Conservative ministers, said: \"The secondments are pernicious, but the real power is how [the energy companies] shape the discourse through the media – that is where their many lobbyists do their real work. They constantly feed hard-pressed journalists lines their editors will like.\"</p><p>The energy industry's access to ministers is shown by 195 declared meetings between Decc ministers and energy companies and their lobby groups in the 10 months after the 2010 general election alone. There were 17 meetings with green campaign groups in the same period.</p><p>The heat on Miliband, Fallon and their parliamentary colleagues is clearly going to remain turned up.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419100244|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|5aa2b828dee95fa8d8969043d93326970d521781 -->",
