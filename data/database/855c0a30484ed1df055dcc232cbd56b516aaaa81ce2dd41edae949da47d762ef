Everybody knows what a pizza is.</p> <p><strong>So you’re referring to the popular foodstuff.</strong> Yes, but pizza is so much more than that: culinary classic, cultural touchstone, stuffed crust abomination, index of civil disorder.</p> <p><strong>Index of civil disorder? </strong>You can tell a lot about a society’s deterioration from its pizza, <a href=\"http://qz.com/738707/your-pizza-delivery-guy-might-be-the-real-winner-this-election-year/\">if you know how to read the signs</a>.</p> <p><strong>Speaking of signs, I was once served a pizza that looked like Jesus, but I sent it back because it had anchovies on it. </strong>To be fair, we’re talking more about pizza deliveries.</p> <p><strong>And after they took the anchovies off, it looked more like Billie Jean King. </strong>Are you paying attention?</p> <p><strong>No, I’m thinking about pizza. Where were we? </strong>In the United States, where during a year of political turmoil and civil unrest, foot traffic at restaurants is about 5% down.</p> <p><strong>I guess it’s hard to choose appetisers when you think you’re about to be shot. </strong>Pizza delivery, on the other hand, is up, to the extent that delivery chain Papa John’s has seen its share price nearly double between December and July. Domino’s stock has also risen dramatically.</p> <p><strong>So American consumers have transferred the unacceptable risk of going outside to delivery drivers? </strong>It would seem so. Let’s hope they’re tipping well.</p> <p><strong>Pizza is a big deal in the US, isn’t it? </strong>It is. First introduced to the US by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century, pizza is now a $30bn industry. It is said that Americans consume about a hundred acres of pizza a day.</p> <p><strong>Is this trend for holing up and ordering in set to continue? </strong>“We expect this phenomenon will play out at least through the general election in November,” says restaurant analyst Chris O’Cull.</p> <p><strong>Or, if Trump gets in, for the next four to eight years. </strong>If Trump gets in, I expect people will start cooking their own pizzas, on discarded hubcaps over open fires.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Pizza is like sex: when it’s good, it’s amazing; when it’s terrible, it’s still pretty good.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And also, when you’re feeling bad about yourself, you can always order some online.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"404","commentCloseDate":"2016-07-30T12:15:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-07-27T11:42:55Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-07-27T12:11:51Z","internalComposerCode":"57989e3fe4b0e0542bbb2593","internalOctopusCode":"11757240","internalPageCode":"2623691","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-28T13:55:59Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-07-28T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Is this where people start describing things such as ratatouille provençale as “essential”?</strong> No, but thanks for getting the Essential Waitrose joke out of the way nice and early.</p> <p><strong>I think I’ve heard about the Waitrose effect before.</strong> Be careful, because there are actually two Waitrose effects. This isn’t the one where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/03/shopping.business\">a Waitrose moves into town and all the independent stores close</a>.</p> <p><strong>Phew. </strong>This is much better. This Waitrose effect is where a Waitrose moves into town and your house rockets in value.</p> <p><strong>Is that really a thing?</strong> It is. Lloyds bank has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/24/living-near-waitrose-could-add-38831-to-your-house-price-survey/\">claimed</a> that properties located near a branch of Waitrose cost an average of £425,428, while houses further away cost an average of £386,763. That’s a £40,000 difference.</p> <p><strong>Wow. Spend all that money at Waitrose and you’d be able to buy, what, three loaves of bread?</strong> Yes, yes, Waitrose is expensive, we get it.</p> <p><strong>Hang on a minute, I thought </strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11342283/Half-of-UK-households-are-now-shopping-at-Aldi-or-Lidl.html\"><strong>more people were shopping at Aldi and Lidl these days</strong></a><strong>?</strong> Oh, yes, we’ve started to do most of our shopping at discount supermarkets. But the trick is not to live near them. Lloyds claims that living near an Aldi will push your house price up by just £1,333.</p> <p><strong>That’s a bargain</strong>. But it means you’ll be forced to live among a bunch of Aldi shoppers. Ugh, imagine.</p> <p><strong>But you shop at Aldi!</strong> Shh, don’t tell anyone. I take Waitrose bags and fill them with tinned potatoes and frozen mince. My neighbours must never know my shame. Never!</p> <p><strong>God, being middle class sounds exhausting.</strong> You have no idea.</p> <p><strong>I don’t live near a Waitrose. Is there any way I can boost the price of my house?</strong> You could always try to mimic the Waitrose effect by slathering your house in taramasalata. That might work.</p> <p><strong>Is that regular Waitrose taramasalata or Essential Waitrose taramasalata? </strong>Fine. You get two Essential Waitrose jokes.

record and play films and television programmes in the home.</p> <p><strong>So it’s like a hard disk recorde</strong>r? Yes. Except it doesn’t store movies. You have to keep them separately in a library somewhere, and use blanks to record something new.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/22/vhs-betamax-japan\">VHS is dead, but at least it outlived Betamax tapes by nine months</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Ah. I get it. More like a DVD system then?</strong> Yes. Except the video is recorded on a spool of magnetic tape, a VHS, meaning that the picture and sound quality is terrible, and over time gets worse. Plus you have to spend ages rewinding and fast-forwarding to find the bit you need. And the cassettes themselves are huge.</p> <p><strong>OK. So basically it’s a terrible old machine. </strong>You young folk don’t know you’re born! The VCR was wonderful! It’s a sad day now that we know its era is about to end.</p> <p><strong>You mean its era is still going?</strong> Just. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/10/betamax-dead-long-live-vhs-sony-end-prodution\" title=\"\">last Betamax</a> cassette was made in March. And one Japanese company – Funai Electric – still makes VCRs, often for other brands such as Sanyo. <em>But</em> they’ve now announced that <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/83427/japan-will-make-its-last-ever-vcr-month\" title=\"\">production will stop by the end of the month</a>. Just 750,000 of Funai’s new machines were sold last year, mostly in China.</p> <p><strong>And this is sad because … </strong>VCRs were where it all started, man! When they first became affordable in the 1980s, it created a new world of home entertainment and exploration, not to mention a new institution: the video shop.</p> <p><strong>You used to have to go to a shop to rent a film?</strong> Yes. Although often when you got there, someone else had rented it first. And you had to take it back afterwards, or you ended up paying more.</p> <p><strong>Happy days.</strong> They were, although of course we didn’t know it at the time. And who could forget VHS v Betamax? The greatest-ever format war!</p> <p><strong>I’m not really a connoisseur of format wars. </strong>Never mind. The VCR also opened a golden age of extreme horror movies and pornography.</p> <p><strong>Um … Great.</strong> You may scoff, but some of the old “video nasties” are <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-vhs-tapes-now-worth-1500-these-are-the-25-most-valuable-a6961061.html#gallery\" title=\"\">worth a lot of money now</a>. The moral panic that surrounded them turned out to be quite wrong, too.</p> <p><strong>I’m not really a connoisseur of moral panics, either. </strong>Fair enough.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “You can’t beat the little grey lines and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qELSSAspRDI\" title=\"\">authentic wobble of lovely old VHS</a>.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Pah!

It’s always like: “Ooh, do this useful thing for hours and we’ll give you money to buy electricity.” And I’m like: “Electricity is boring. I want a Ferrari!” And work’s like: “In that case, do more work.” And I’m like: “You always say that …” </strong>Good, yes. You seem to grasp the basic principle. And you’ll be pleased to hear that ignoring the demands of work might actually be good for you.</p> <p><strong>I’m ecstatic. Is this scientists again?</strong> Economists.</p> <p><strong>Close enough. Give me the details so I can explain them to my boss.</strong> Well, these economists, who work at the University of Copenhagen and Purdue University, Indiana, <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w22365 peg\">looked at the health of Danish manufacturing workers between 1996 and 2006</a>. Some had quiet spells; some suddenly got a lot of foreign orders, making them very busy.</p> <p><strong>And what did they discover?</strong> Women at companies that experienced an export boom were significantly more likely to be treated afterwards for severe depression, or take medication to protect against heart attacks or strokes. The rate of serious work injuries also increased among both men and women.</p> <p><strong>Interesting.</strong> They also found that workers took fewer sick days when the company first got busy, but when things became extremely busy, they suddenly started taking more. Companies experiencing one of the top 25% biggest booms had 14% more sick days among men, and 24% among women.</p> <p><strong>So women are soft?</strong> I wouldn’t say that. Maybe women work harder during booms? Although it does seem to be a bigger problem for women.</p> <p><strong>How do these economists know that Denmark isn’t weird? There is, after all, nothing like a Dane.</strong> That’s true, but Denmark has the best data for their purposes. You <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/19/the-clearest-proof-yet-that-your-job-is-killing-you/\">can’t just work people half to death to see what happens.</a></p> <p><strong>Tell that to my boss.</strong> Besides, lots of other evidence associates working too hard with health problems. An Australian study in February found that working more than 25 hours a week may even lower the IQ of people over 40.</p> <p><strong>That explains why I’m so clever! I spend all my time on Facebook or making tea.</strong> Twenty-five hours is the optimum. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20160714-is-full-time-work-bad-for-our-brains\">Working less than that was also correlated with a lower IQ.</a></p> <p><strong>Oh. </strong>Indeed.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> I’m not lazy, I’m just very, very health-conscious.</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> Sorry. I can’t come in today. I’m not ill, but I feel as though I might be.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"424","commentCloseDate":"2016-07-23T12:15:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-07-20T11:42:37Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-07-20T12:20:13Z","internalComposerCode":"578f63ade4b0378a304b1e55","internalOctopusCode":"11737401","internalPageCode":"2620640","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-25T14:26:31Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

With all due respect for Baio’s early work, how much winning has he actually done since the 1980s? </strong>Oh, well, you know. No huge hits, but he has kept in work. He was in Diagnosis Murder for a couple of seasons in the early 1990s. In 2004 he starred in Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2, which is now widely considered one of the worst films ever made.

Barack Obama (a nerdy young black guy) picked Joe Biden (a jazzy old white man) to join him on the ticket in 2008.
