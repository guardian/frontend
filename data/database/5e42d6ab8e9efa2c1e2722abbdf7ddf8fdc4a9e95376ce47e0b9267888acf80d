Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Ten years ago we launched the <em>Observer</em> Ethical Awards with the notion that a lot of good people were doing brilliant things to bring environmental and social justice to the UK, and that this should be celebrated. We also had a hunch that real change would come from these people, as opposed to our waiting for the government. A decade later these awards (gratifyingly called the “green Oscars”) are firmly rooted in the social calendar and attract thousands of entries. Our alumni have achieved spectacular things, from changing conservation law to securing major funding for designs for storing clean energy. They have written books, set up businesses, taught kids how to be green and built houses from straw bales. We could not be prouder.</p> <p>The winners all cite these awards as a significant boost to their campaigns. And now, by nominating and voting in this year’s awards, you can help promote more ethical warriors. We’re looking for unsung green heroes (often working quietly and modestly for years), from designers who can redefine ethical fashion to a new crop of Young Green Champions. And for the first time, we join up with Bafta to find the greenest TV or film production of the year.</p> <p>Our list of judges represents a sort of Greatest Hits from a decade of inspired panellists who each year approach a difficult task with enthusiasm and amazing energy. Let’s make this year a record breaker. So please nominate and vote as never before and make this a 10th birthday to remember.</p> <h2>Nominate now<br /></h2> <p>Celebrate the people who are making the world a better place. Nominate them, a company or even yourself using the simple online form at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/observer-ethical-awards\">observer.co.uk/ethical-awards</a>. Then vote for your favourites from Sunday 26 April.</p> <h2>Campaigner of the year<br /></h2> <p>Which public figure has stood out over the past 12 months and really helped to bring about substantive change? We are looking for someone who has put ethical issues at the top of the agenda, from environmental issues to civil rights and beyond. Who will be your campaigner of the year for 2015? Past winners of this award have included everyone from Malala Yousafzai, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Al Gore to Joanna Lumley and Dr Brian May.</p> <h2>Green Briton of the year (Sponsored by Ecotricity)<br /></h2> <p>This category represents a double birthday: as the Ethical Awards celebrates a decade of grassroots change, Ecotricity – Britain’s trailblazing green-energy supplier – marks 20 years since it first introduced green electricity to Britain and the world back in 1995. Together, the Observer and Ecotricity are on a mission to find and honour the past year’s most active, resourceful and successful green Briton. If you know someone whose actions have inspired others to live more sustainably, and whose work promotes a vision of a better and greener Britain, then nominate them now. We are searching for the name of a hardworking volunteer, a conservationist, an educator, an inventor, a business person or an activist who you would love to see rewarded for their vision, drive and commitment to the environment and sustainability in Britain.</p> <h2>Best ethical product of the decade<br /></h2> <p>Ethical lifestyles require ethical products. It is time to reward the retailer, designer, brand or shop that has provided a product which made it easier for you to save energy, support producer communities or cut waste and pollution. Which innovation or commodity – from a simple veg box or fairtrade product right up to an electric car – has made the biggest difference to your life and deserves to be crowned as the ultimate ethical product? Nominate now and give us your reasons why it deserves this award.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d427966e08492547b17d16a79c23553b4a4fd520\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421940867106/2ec06136-87fe-4d58-9ee4-14564f46963f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Previous winner Guy Watson from Riverford.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Previous Ethical Awards winner Guy Watson from Riverford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The community energy project (Sponsored by National Grid)<br /></h2> <p>From sports clubs to village halls and shared-housing schemes, we’re in the midst of a ground-up revolution in power. We are casting our net wide for energy projects or schemes which are designed and powered by communities. Whether you are fully fledged or just starting up, we want to hear about how you are managing your renewables, reducing your energy use, and generating or even redistributing energy. The winning project will receive £5,000 in funding from National Grid.</p> <h2>Arts and culture<br /></h2> <p>Have you seen a production, film, play or exhibition that has really inspired you to act ethically in your daily life? Is there a book or a song that has made you think differently about the way the world works – and changed the way you behave? Or are you using ethical best practice in your own work in the arts? Whether it’s small or large, local or national, nominate your favourite to win our arts and culture Ethical Award for 2015.</p> <h2>Sustainable style (supported by EcoAge)<br /></h2> <p>To mark our 10th anniversary, we want you to design an ethical outfit for our judge Livia Firth, queen of the green carpet. Whether you elect to put an ethical twist on a recent trend or refashion a classic piece in an innovative green fibre, we invite designs both from budding student designers and from those with established pedigrees. Helping to judge the award alongside Livia Firth will be head of the Centre for Sustainable Fashion, Dilys Williams of the London College of Fashion.</p> <h2>Ecover young green champion (sponsored by Ecover)<br /></h2> <p>Send us your brilliant ideas about how you are making your school, community or even the world a better place. We want to help make your ideas a reality. Working individually or as a group, tell us how your ideas make a difference. If you’re already doing great work, perhaps we can help you take your ideas further. This award comes with a generous £6,000 bursary from Ecover for your scheme*.

Maybe you or someone you know spends their time rescuing peregrine falcons or saving hedgehogs, or dedicates their weekends to helping preserve habitats for bugs or wildflower meadows for bees. Send us your nominations for individuals, groups or wildlife charities that you feel deserve recognition.</p> <h2>Film and television (Supported by Bafta and Albert) <br /></h2> <p>Behind the scenes, from green set construction to paperless script editing, there’s a revolution going on as the entertainment industry lessens its impact on the planet. We’ve teamed up with Bafta, chair of the industry’s sustainability consortium, to invite nominations with an impressive ethical edge. From the small to the silver screen, from moving-image production teams to film and TV buffs with insider knowledge, help us crown the first ever film and television Ethical Award winner.</p>

<p>The Observer Ethical Awards have become a fundamental part of our year, they have been at the forefront of ethical recognitions and all the brands who won in each category wear them with pride! I hope this year we will get flooded with submissions and I am sure it will be even harder than ever to choose a winner!</p> <p><em>Livia Firth, filmmaker and owner of Eco Age</em></p> <p>&quot;The Observer Ethical Awards are the most credible awards of their type in the UK. My involvement dates back to the first awards in 2006 and since its inception a robust and detailed approach has been given to the judging process. Award winners can promote their environmental and ethical credentials on the basis they have been rigorously assessed by a team of expert and celebrity judges with a broad knowledge and experience in the field. Each year the number and quality of entries increases and I am looking forward to judging the awards again in 2013.&quot; </p> <p><em>Prof. Rob Holdway, director Giraffe Innovation Ltd</em></p> <p>It is always a real pleasure to be involved with the Ethical Awards, alongside such well respected individuals. The nominees are always incredibly inspiring, and at times, it&apos;s very difficult to select just one winner! I&apos;m a firm believer in rewarding businesses and entrepreneurs who try and promote ethics within their work.</p> <h2>Clare Allman, UK marketing manager, Ecover</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-429796678\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2011/12/22/1324547047228/Observer-Ethical-awards-2-004.jpg\" alt=\"Observer Ethical awards 2012 judge Clare Allman\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Observer Ethical awards 2012 judge Clare Allman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clare was born in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire and graduated from Birmingham University with a BSc (hons) in chemistry and embarked on a career in marketing spanning retail and consumer products.</p> <p>After a career break and the birth of three boys, Clare joined Ecover in 2000 and has worked on the support, interpretation and marketing direction of the brand as it faces the challenges of ecology being in the limelight and an increasingly competitive and confused market.
