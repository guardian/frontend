        "headline":"UK income gap shrinks to narrowest margin for 25 years",
        "body":"<p>Post-recession Britain has become a less unequal place than at any time for 25 years, with wages stagnating while benefits and tax credits have helped protect the incomes of the poorest, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_317365.pdf\" title=\"\">according to official figures</a>.</p><p>In its annual analysis of the impact of taxes and benefits on consumers, the Office for National Statistics said that in 2011-12 the gap between rich and poor was at its narrowest since 1986, measured using the internationally recognised Gini index. The index places countries on a scale between perfect equality, where everyone's income is the same – represented as a score of zero – and 100% inequality, where one person takes home the entire national income.</p><p>The measure for the UK slipped to 32.3%, from 33.7% a year earlier. In the US, the Gini index is above 40%, while in Sweden, for example, it is as low as 25%.</p><p>Inequality tends to fall during economic downturns, as benefits are uprated in line with inflation while wages are hit by rising unemployment. But experts expect the recent decline in inequality to be reversed, once the coalition government's benefit curbs come into force.</p><p>Robert Joyce, senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: \"For low-income households, much of the pain is happening now or is still to come, because we're in the middle of a period when benefits are being cut back.\"</p><p>Average annual wages fell by more than £1,200 in the three years following the crash, while pensions and most state benefits continued to be uprated in line with inflation. The average income for the poorest fifth of households was up by 6.9% over the same period. More recent policies, including the chancellor's 1% cap on working-age benefit increases until 2016, are expected to reverse that trend.</p><p>Before taxes and benefits, the richest fifth of households had an average income of £78,300 in 2011-12. That was 14 times greater than the poorest fifth, whose incomes averaged £5,400.</p><p>However, once cash benefits such as the state pension and tax credits were factored in, the ratio dropped to 6:1, with the top fifth earning £80,700 a year compared with the poorest fifth's £12,900 average. The gap was down from the previous year, when the richer fifth earned 16 times the income of the poorest households.</p><p>The ONS analysis also revealed the hefty chunk the exchequer takes from those at the bottom of the income scale in taxes. The poorest fifth of UK households lost almost a third of their disposable incomes in indirect taxes such as VAT, alcohol and fuel duty in 2011-12. The ONS said the increase in the rate of VAT from 17.5% to 20% in January 2011 helped drive the amount of indirect tax paid by the lowest earners up to £3,400 a year, or 29% of their disposable cash.</p><p>In contrast, while the richest fifth of households paid an average of £8,700, the difference in their earnings meant this was just 14% of their disposable income. \"Indirect taxes act to increase inequality of income,\" the ONS said.</p><p>Unions said the figures showed the government should prioritise lowering the rate of VAT rather than increasing the personal income tax allowance to £10,000, a pledge made by the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg.</p><p>The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"Low-income families will gain virtually nothing from the increase in the personal allowance, but will continue to lose significantly from the rise in VAT.</p><p>\"Contrary to what ministers claim, the government's tax policies are having a negative impact on the poorest households.\"</p><p>Direct taxes, including income tax, cost households an average of £7,400 over the year, equivalent to 20% of their gross income. The poorest fifth paid around £1,300 or 10% of income, of which the largest component was council tax. The richest fifth of households paid £19,900 or 25% of gross income, of which most was income tax.</p><p>The ONS said the average disposable income of a UK household was 2.24 times higher in real terms than in 1977, but that incomes had not grown evenly. While the average income of the richest households was 2.49 times higher, among the poorest households that figure fell to 1.93.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412578074|2013-10-11T06:13:48Z|5d7ba0d41cb6bb1b11e9eaeaf442ead08b22855d -->",

        "body":"<p>Government ministers may insist that soaring demand for food banks may have nothing to do with welfare reform, but for Louise, a homeless, quietly distressed 31-year-old unemployed ex-care worker, the link is clear.</p><p>In May she lost her job, and in late June she was evicted from her flat. She says the council's new local welfare scheme told her she was not eligible for crisis help, and the local jobcentre, having \"fast-tracked\" her claim for unemployment benefit, explained that she would have to wait up to three weeks for the first payment.</p><p>Until then she is penniless. Louise says she sought a short-term cash advance from the jobcentre to tide her over until her first benefit cheque but was not offered one. Jobcentre officials, she says, instead referred her to the charity-run <a href=\"http://www.pecan.org.uk/our-projects/foodbank\" title=\"\">Pecan food bank</a> in south London to collect a food parcel. \"I feel helpless and marginalised,\" she said.</p><p>At Pecan, the <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2013-07-02a.1071.0&amp;s=speaker%3A13554#g1071.1\" title=\"\">claim made by the work and pensions minister Lord Freud</a> last week that there was no evidence of a correlation between rising food bank use and welfare changes is regarded with incredulity.</p><p>Chris Price, Pecan's executive director, says food banks risk becoming a precarious charitable safety net for a welfare system that is failing to provide the support to which claimants are entitled, and that that a voluntary project originally designed to meet tiny gaps in state provision is being almost imperceptibly sucked into a mainstream welfare role.</p><p>Local jobcentres and welfare changes are the biggest drivers of food bank demand, says Price. Benefits delays and benefits penalties, called sanctions, which typically result in claimants' payments being stopped for six weeks, are driving up food bank demand to the point where Pecan is finding it hard to keep pace.</p><p>Although Freud insisted that the welfare system was designed to \"support people with advances of benefit where they require it\", Price says that in his experience jobcentres are instead referring vulnerable claimants to food banks. \"They [jobcentre staff] do not use it [the cash advances system] or they are advised not to use it.\"</p><p>He adds: \"The jobcentre official is saying to the claimants in effect: 'We cannot give you any money, but here's a voucher for a food bank because we don't want to see you starving.'</p><p>\"If claimants are coming to us instead of getting a short-term advance then they are getting food, but if we keep doing that it puts us in a position where we are becoming part of the welfare state.\"</p><p>Pecan says the rapid growth in referrals from the local welfare system began a few months ago but has accelerated since April, when several welfare changes were introduced. Between 1 April and 31 May it fulfilled 486 vouchers, of which 117 came from three local jobcentres. Over the same period in 2012 none of the 134 vouchers fulfilled were from jobcentres.</p><p>Benefit changes – people being shifted from one benefit onto another – and benefit delays have accounted for 210 of those 486 vouchers, says Pecan. A further 33 food parcels were issued to people turned down for crisis help by the council's crisis welfare scheme, which was introduced in April when the social fund was abolished.</p><p>Even that does not tell the full story, says Felicia Bolshorin, a Pecan staff member. People arrive at the food bank having been formally referred by other agencies, such as Citizens Advice, but when they are interviewed it often turns out that their financial problems are caused by benefit delays or loss altogether.</p><p>Bolshorin says she wrote to the local jobcentres a fortnight ago pleading with them to stop referring so many claimants, because the food bank was finding it difficult to cope with the demand. \"Two weeks ago I interviewed 29 clients and 17 of them were referred from Jobcentre Plus. I'd say 99% of them had been sanctioned.\"</p><p>Food banks like Pecan are dependant on the public donations for food, and Price says he is worried that the public will be more reluctant to give if they feel the food bank is being used as a substitute for social security entitlements.</p><p>In Bristol the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.the-matthew-tree-project.org/foodstore.html\" title=\"\">Matthew Tree Project</a> food bank, Mark Goodway, says it has purposefully refused to take referrals from Jobcentre Plus because it anticipated that it would not be able to cope with the number of referrals. But despite this, jobcentres gave out maps to claimants instructing them how to get to the food bank anyway.</p><p>Clients referred to the food bank by other agencies often have problems rooted in benefit delays or sanctions, says Goodway. \"I saw a client [recently]. The good news was that his claim had been accepted. The bad news was that he was going to have to wait six to eight weeks for his money to come through.</p><p>\"He will be destitute for up to eight weeks, and that's happening across the board. What are these people supposed to live on?\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412618519|2013-10-11T06:13:48Z|33948e93393b67c6153526901101398141bf1576 -->",

        "headline":"Universal credit scheme suffers further delays",
        "body":"<p>Further delays to the government's flagship universal credit scheme were revealed on Wednesday by the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, who said the scheme would only be extended to six more jobcentres in October, and the client base would remain single jobseeker's allowance claimants, the simplest ones to process.</p><p>He also refused to commit to all new claimants on working age benefits being on universal credit by April 2014, as originally planned.</p><p>He said: &quot;I will not be set by the artificial date of April 2014.&quot; Instead, he said there would be &quot;significant volumes&quot; of new claimants moving on to universal credit through 2014.</p><p>The scheme since April this year has covered only four jobcentres across the country, and only the most simple claimants to process.</p><p>Universal credit is the government's flagship welfare reform designed to make work pay by integrating the six major working age benefits.</p><p>Speaking to the work and pensions select committee, the welfare minister Lord Freud admitted there had been a change of approach since the original autumn 2011 timetable. He said: &quot;We have gone massively over to testing and building systems around it. It is really important that we have systems that cope with the most vulnerable people.&quot;</p><p>Duncan Smith said: &quot;We are trying to land this at the right time and not according to an artificial timetable.&quot; He insisted the scheme was still able to meet its final target of completion by the end of 2017.</p><p>There have been repeated delays to the scheme due to a variety of technical and administrative problems. Howard Shiplee, the Universal Credit director general, refused to say how many people would be on Universal Credit by the end of the year, saying that would be &quot;a hostage to fortune&quot;.</p><p>Dame Anne Begg, the Labour chair of the committee, said the department was moving at &quot;snail's pace&quot;. She claimed the department had promised there would be a national rollout this autumn, and not just in 10 jobcentres, but in 1.5% of the jobcentres in the UK.</p><p>She also said there was no evidence the government was testing more complex claimants.</p><p>Freud countered that the government wanted to track how those already enrolled on universal credit managed as their cases became more complicated, such as when they married, had children, or found work. Lord Freud said: &quot;We will be getting more and more complicated situations, and our objective is to track those very specifically as we get them. The reason we are testing every element we can is because there are lots of different groups and we need to understand how each of them works before we ramp it up.&quot;</p><p>Duncan Smith also said jobcentre staff across the country would be trained in the &quot;claimant commitment&quot; setting out the responsibilities of individuals receiving the new benefit, and 6,000 new computers would be installed so people could access online services.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412572755|2013-10-11T06:13:48Z|4d5421238256d84c03f9e1971dc3483bd3b470ad -->",

        "headline":"Top 5 spoof Twitter accounts",
        "body":"<p>David Cameron faced embarrassment this morning when he tweeted earnestly about a new cap on benefits. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/356670882065809408\">prime minister posted</a>: 'We're rolling out a cap on Benefits today - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDS_MP\">@IDS_MP</a> and I are determined to make work pay, and help the UK compete on the #GlobalRace.' Unfortunately, the Iain Duncan-Smith account <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jul/15/cameron-tweets-fake-iain-duncan-smith?CMP=twt_gu\">he referenced</a> is a spoof account, which spends a lot of time mocking the government for being out of touch and heartless. Sample tweets include: </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>A thrifty way to keep cool in this heat wave is to dab the ice from your Champagne bucket onto your forehead.</p><p>&mdash; Iain Duncan Smith MP (@IDS_MP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDS_MP/statuses/356149625931038722\">July 13, 2013</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Wonderful cocktails last night. They were bitter and left a nasty taste in the mouth but just one had me laughing. Calling them 'Coal Miner'</p><p>&mdash; Iain Duncan Smith MP (@IDS_MP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDS_MP/statuses/323015131619553280\">April 13, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p>David Cameron is not the first to be taken in by a spoof Twitter account. There are hundreds of them (as we speak, someone will be making a royal baby account). For the most part, spoof accounts are pretty bland, but occasionally one pops up that really nails the parody. Here are our top spoof tweeters: </p><h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKierkegaard\">@KimKierkegaard</a></h2><p>A mash-up of quotes from the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and reality TV celebrity Kim Kardashian work amazingly well. The author obviously spends a lot of time carefully putting the tweets together, and they rarely fail to crack me up. Sample tweets include: </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Send me pics of your best Kardashian Glow tan! So that we may glimpse the damage done to your soul.&mdash; KimKierkegaardashian (@KimKierkegaard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKierkegaard/statuses/316373884930777089\">March 26, 2013</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Is reason alone baptized? The sexy secretary look lets you have both.&mdash; KimKierkegaardashian (@KimKierkegaard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKierkegaard/statuses/343231393268105216\">June 8, 2013</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoritosOntario\">@DoritosOntario</a></h2><p>Most corporate accounts are boring, official and unimaginative (don't you dare say that about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/commentisfree\">@commentisfree</a>). So we welcome this parody account for Doritos in Canada. Might even make us buy their dusty orange crisps. Sample tweets include:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Don't worry about the shape of Doritos similarity to illuminati symbology. Just don't worry about it. What's on TV?&mdash; Doritos Ontario (@DoritosOntario) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoritosOntario/statuses/355381313701818368\">July 11, 2013</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Do you feed your pets Doritos? Send us a photo, but please dont tell the police we told you to feed your pet Doritos. But pls take a picture</p><p>&mdash; Doritos Ontario (@DoritosOntario) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoritosOntario/statuses/353349814458654720\">July 6, 2013</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FakeAPStylebook\">@FakeAPStylebook</a><br /></h2><p>Respected writers might use the AP stylebook to guide them on grammar and punctuation, but the smart people go straight to FakeAPStylebook. Likely to enrage purists, this account offers terrible advice for aspiring authors, but it's very funny. Sample tweets include:</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>If you wrote a column making a hilariously incorrect election prediction, an apology or resignat--ha ha just kidding, it's cool.&mdash; Fake AP Stylebook (@FakeAPStylebook) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FakeAPStylebook/statuses/268444518976729088\">November 13, 2012</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Baning - Using a Sean Connery impression to scare people. Don't confuse with \"boning,\" something else Sean Connery does better than you.&mdash; Fake AP Stylebook (@FakeAPStylebook) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FakeAPStylebook/statuses/228866832277327873\">July 27, 2012</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrsStephenFry\">@MrsStephenFry</a></h2><p>One of the original parody accounts, Mrs Fry pertains to be the long suffering wife of Stephen Fry, who helped boost her popularity by playing along. Since her early success, she's written a book, and come out of the shadows a little bit. Sample tweets include: </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Our kids are so embarrassed when there's sex on tv they go straight to bed. Stephen and I sometimes fall off but it's worth it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bedtimelive&amp;src=hash\">#bedtimelive</a>&mdash; Mrs Stephen Fry (@MrsStephenFry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrsStephenFry/statuses/314113184363589632\">March 19, 2013</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Please give anything you can to Comic Relief and hopefully, together, we can help put Michael McIntyre out of his misery. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RND&amp;src=hash\">#RND</a>&mdash; Mrs Stephen Fry (@MrsStephenFry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrsStephenFry/statuses/312669149593751552\">March 15, 2013</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DMReporter\">@DMReporter</a></h2><p>Exactly what it sounds like. This parody account has adopted the voice of the Daily Mail to an almost spooky level of accuracy. Mainly tweeting about cancer, women and what you should be outraged by, this account is like reading the real Daily Mail, but with added laughs. Sample tweets include: </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>This week's Daily Mail Cancer List: &#10;Mo) Shadows &#10;Tu) Lidl &#10;We) Hayfever &#10;Th) German food &#10;Fr) Sun lotion &#10;Sa) Pylons &#10;Su) Stopped clocks&mdash; The DM Reporter (@DMReporter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DMReporter/statuses/356369358555062272\">July 14, 2013</a></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>APPEAL: Are you a freelance journalist and mother? Will you write an article personally critical of your children? Contact our newsdesk now.</p><p>&mdash; The DM Reporter (@DMReporter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DMReporter/statuses/355301854357360640\">July 11, 2013</a></p></blockquote><p> Do you have a favourite spoof Twitter account?

        "body":"<p>Before joining Twitter, the prime minister, David Cameron, once opined that “too many Tweets might make a twat”. Following his most recent tweet on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jul/15/benefits-cap-rolled-out-britain\">the benefits cap that comes into action on Monday</a>, he may be inclined to revisit the ribald advice. On Monday morning, Cameron tweeted his support for the changes and the minister spearheading them, Iain Duncan Smith, writing:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/statuses/356670882065809408\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>We're rolling out a cap on Benefits today - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IDS_MP\">@IDS_MP</a> and I are determined to make work pay, and help the UK compete on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GlobalRace&amp;src=hash\">#GlobalRace</a>.</p>— David Cameron (@David_Cameron) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/statuses/356670882065809408\">July 15, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> <p>But his eagle-eyed followers were quicker than the prime minister to realise that the Twitter account @IDS_MP is, in fact, a parody account of the work and pensions secretary – and one with which Cameron may not be keen to ally himself. Pronouncements include:</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IDS_MP/statuses/356421411688030210\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I've always supported a Mansion Tax.

        "headline":"Benefit cap: is it persuading more people to get a job?",
        "body":"<p>To accompany the roll-out of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/benefit-cap\" title=\"\">benefit cap</a> on Monday morning, the work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith gave an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jul/15/iain-duncan-smith-statistics-benefits-cap\" title=\"\">interview</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036tsn9/live\" title=\"\">BBC Today programme</a> in which he claimed that the policy was working because the threat of being hit by the cap had persuaded more people to move off benefits and into a job.</p><p>But is he right?</p><h2><strong>What is the benefit cap?</strong></h2><p>Essentially, the benefits cap proposes that no out-of-work household should have a benefits income of more that £26,000 a year (£500 a week for families, £350 for single people), which the government says is the average household income of working families. Approximately 40,000 households in the UK will be affected, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p><p>Over half of the households are in London, where high private sector rents (and consequently, housing benefit payments) mean that one in three of the households affected by the cap in the capital will lose at least £100 a week as a result.</p><p>Households will avoid the cap if an adult member can find a job that offers at least 16 hours a week (for single parents) or 24 hours (for couples). The government says the threat of the cap will be to incentivise more people into work, cutting the benefits bill.</p><h2><strong>Does the benefit cap work?</strong></h2><p>Duncan Smith claimed in the BBC interview that benefit claimants had been galvanised to get a job by the threat of the cap. He said:</p><p><blockquote>I believe we are already seeing people go back to work who were not going to go back to work until they were short of the cap</blockquote></p><p>He added:</p><p><blockquote>I believe that this will show as we go forward that people who are not seeking work are now seeking work because that's the way to avoid the cap</blockquote></p><p>This line was trailed in the Telegraph, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9401928/Benefits-cap-pushing-thousands-into-work.html\" title=\"\"> which reported:</a></p><p><blockquote>These figures show the benefit cap is already a success and is actively encouraging people back to work </blockquote></p><p>Duncan Smith said in the interview that although he had no statistical evidence yet to back up his claim, the DWP had published polling which supported his view. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-perceptions-of-the-benefit-cap-and-pre-implementation-impacts\" title=\"\">poll, by Ipsos Mori</a>, consisted of telephone interviews in May and June with 500 people who had been notified over the past 12 months that they would be affected by the cap, but who had subsequently moved into work.</p><p>The survey was carried out to attempt to find out from claimants whether being told they would be affected by the cap specifically \"encouraged them to find work\".</p><p>The DWP report states:</p><p><blockquote>There is evidence that the policy has encouraged some claimants to take action to avoid the benefit cap before implementation</blockquote></p><p>But how many is \"some claimants\"? In order to be motivated by the threat of a cap on benefits, you need to know that the threat exists in the first place. Only 57% of claimants remembered getting written notification that they would be affected by the cap. Of those who remember getting the letter, 37% found it very or fairly difficult to understand. This suggests that the cap may have been a hazy presence for many recipients.</p><p>The poll then asked those who recalled being notified of the cap what actions they subsequently took, if any. Strikingly, the biggest category, almost half of claimants (46%), said:</p><p><blockquote>Nothing</blockquote></p><p>So how many looked for a job? According to the poll, 31%. But asked what they were doing before they were told about the cap, 52% said they were already looking for a job (A separate poll question said that 71% recalled actively attending job interviews and submitting CVs in the weeks before notification).</p><p>According to the poll, notification of the cap had remarkably little impact on a range of behaviours, whether taking benefits advice, increasing the number of hours worked, or moving to a cheaper property (although marginally more claimants said the letter persuaded them to contact to the Job Centre).</p><p>The report says that of those who recall being notified of the cap (or being aware of it), 47% took \"some sort of action\". Asked what that action might be, 62% said they looked for a job. According to the DWP:</p><p><blockquote>That equates to 29% of all those ... who were aware they would be affected</blockquote></p><p>That suggests that just under a third of all those threatened with the cap looked for a job.</p><p>But was it the threat of the cap specifically that spurred them on? The report notes that of those who remember being formally notified, 61% said they found their current job after they had been formally told they would be threatened with the cap. That sounds promising.</p><p>But the report issues a firm rider to this claim:</p><p><blockquote>This analysis is confined to correlation and does not show causation</blockquote></p><p>In other words, it would be wrong to claim that the poll finds a clear link between the benefit cap and moving into work. Some people may have been persuaded to go out and get a job but it is equally likely that they may have found work anyway.</p><p>And the report makes it clear that most people threatened by the cap were not \"workshy\". The vast majority of respondents reported that they have always worked (10%), mostly worked (43%) or sometimes worked (29%). Only 5% had never been in paid employment.</p><p>This suggests that work was a part of the lives of the vast majority of these households before the cap, as well as after.</p><h2><strong>So, is Duncan Smith right?</strong></h2><p>The employment secretary \"believes\" the cap is working. But as his own poll report shows, there is very little evidence that it may be working as he intends, and certainly no proof of a link. In summary, the poll shows that:</p><p>• Given the draconian consequences of the cap, remarkably few of those affected even remembered even being notified of it.</p><p>• Of those that were aware of the cap, most said they were actively looking for work anyway.</p><p>• Of those who found work, 61% entered work after notification – but there is no evidence that the cap played a role in getting them into employment.</p><p>A DWP spokesperson accepted that while the poll did not show absolutely that the cap was having the effect intended, it did offer \"quite compelling evidence\".</p><p>Duncan Smith has made similar claims about  the efficacy of the cap before. In April, he claimed that the cap had stung 8,000 affect people into work, clearly demonstrating the cap had the desired impact. However, statisticians pointed out that while it was true that 8,000 people had moved into work, there was no evidence that this was caused by the threat of the benefit cap.</p><p>The work and pensions secretary was subsequently <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/may/09/iain-duncan-smith-benefits-cap-statistics\" title=\"\">admonished by the UK Statistics Authority</a>, which said the claim was \"unsupported by the official statistics\".</p><p>Duncan Smith may yet be proved right on the cap. But the latest polling does not offer that proof.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412879802|2013-10-11T06:13:48Z|27623872b4b37256543f237cb8475d4d19704dd6 -->",

        "body":"<p>There are few emotions quite as visceral as the anger that comes from thinking someone is getting something they don't deserve – the something for nothing society that Tory ministers love to condemn. Listening to Prince Charles's advisers explaining to MPs on <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/jul/15/prince-charles-tax-live-blog\" title=\"\">the public accounts committee</a> why the Prince should pay nothing other than income tax on the Duchy of Cornwall's vast property-dealing and farming operations provokes just that kind of why-him fury, the outrage of gut instinct. Somehow, despite owning such plainly commercial businesses as a Waitrose warehouse in Milton Keynes and the Holiday Inn in Reading, the Duchy is not in legal terms a corporation. Consequently, it seems, it has no tax obligations at all. It was a Tory MP who summed it up most succinctly: \"Feudal power plundering the public purse.\"</p><p>Hard-pressed taxpayers are being encouraged to consider the cost of benefits as some kind of plunder, too. As YouGov <a href=\"http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/zinooici1f/YG-Archive-Pol-Sunday-Times-results-120713.pdf\" title=\"\">reported again</a> on Monday, the day of the national roll-out of the benefits cap, the idea of limiting the maximum amount of benefits a family can receive so that they don't get more than a similar family on the average wage – about £500 a week – is extremely popular, with a 79% approval rating. Part of that must be down to the way the language of welfare reform is surreptitiously laced with innuendo about scroungers and skivers. Being popular, though, is a long, long way from being right. And when Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, justifies his policy with unsupported assertions and dodgy statistics, Liam Byrne, his Labour shadow, ought to have a smarter response in mind than appearing to try to sound tougher still – as he did on Monday with his attack on Tory competence.</p><p>This is not to underestimate Labour's <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2013/06/05/margin-calls/\" title=\"\">difficulties</a>. The Tory strategy of eliding its undeserving benefits claimants narrative with Labour's traditional concern for the poor – in his Today programme interview, Mr Duncan Smith repeatedly referred to Labour as \"the welfare party\" in order to undermine its criticisms of his policy – is too slippery to address easily. Last month, after too long a delay, Ed Miliband began to counter attack. He took the key step of <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/one-nation-social-security-reform-miliband-speech\" title=\"\">accepting the case for a benefit cap</a>, and he set out the kind of structural reforms that would tackle the underlying causes of benefit dependence – more jobs, cheaper childcare, lower cost housing. All of these are right and important, but as a whole the argument is too big and complex to establish in a single speech. It's like trying to divert a cruise missile by firing bits of silver paper in the air.</p><p>That's the context of Mr Byrne's accurate but <a href=\" http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/07/labours-disastrous-new-line-attack-benefit-cap-its-too-soft\" title=\"\">tactically dangerous attack</a> on Monday on Conservative incompetence. Undoubtedly, there's a certain black humour in showing that the cap won't work because ministers haven't managed to construct the system so that it does what they want it to do. But the job of the opposition is not to show the government how to do the wrong policy better; it's to explain persuasively to voters why <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/benefit-cap-defiance-logic-editorial\" title=\"\">it's wrong in the first place</a>. Right now, raising the issue of competence might not be such a smart move either.</p><p>Meanwhile, as thousands of families face moving out of their homes to unfamiliar areas and new schools away from family networks, the policy continues to fray. The continued <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jul/10/universal-credit-suffers-delays\" title=\"\">delay in introducing universal credit</a> is one problem; the anticipated cost to individual local authorities of thousands more homeless families – first raised by the communities secretary Eric Pickles <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jul/02/full-text-letter-eric-pickles-welfare-reform\" title=\"\">more than two years ago</a> – is another. Mr Duncan Smith still has only <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jul/15/benefits-cap-rolled-out-britain\" title=\"\">questionable statistics</a> with which to defend his muddled policy objectives. On Monday – after the public reprimand earlier this year for misrepresenting findings about the impact of the benefit cap on jobseeking in the scheme's pilot areas – he produced his own department's research, based on a sample so small that no reliable conclusions about the likelihood of looking for work could be deduced. No wonder he has to rely on gut instinct.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412890270|2013-10-11T06:13:48Z|c9241cc02e2b2a8c3454427cc55c94829df99ce5 -->",

        "body":"<p>A cap on the amount of benefits people can receive has begun to be rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales.</p><p>The cap will see couples and single parents receive no more than £500 a week in benefits, while the limit for single people is £350, although there are some exemptions.</p><p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) restrictions are supposed to provide an incentive for those receiving benefits to seek work and prevent families from receiving more by remaining dependent on welfare. But campaigners have warned that many households will be unable to cope with the resultant drop in income.</p><p>The government's own impact assessment of the Welfare Reform Act estimated that as many as 56,000 households would be affected, losing on average about £93 a week. In London, <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2013-05-13b.154027.h#g154027.q0\" title=\"\">more than 7,000 low-income families will lose more than £100 a week</a>.</p><p>The cap is designed to ensure that benefits payments do not exceed the income of the average working household. Benefits that count towards the cap include child benefit, housing benefit, jobseeker's allowance and incapacity benefit, while others, including disability living allowance and its successor, the personal independence payment, are exempt.</p><p>The cap, which applies to all people of working age, was introduced in April in four London boroughs – Croydon, Bromley, Haringey and Enfield . It began being rolled out elsewhere on Monday and will be fully implemented by 30 September.</p><p>The DWP says the cap will save £110m a year, which compares with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending\" title=\"\">a total benefits bill of £159bn in 2011-12</a>.</p><p>In May, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/may/09/iain-duncan-smith-benefits-cap-statistics\" title=\"\">the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, was criticised by the UK's statistics watchdog</a> for misusing figures to promote the effectiveness of the benefits cap on getting people into work.</p><p>In a press release issued by the DWP in April alongside \"ad hoc\" statistics, Duncan Smith was quoted as saying: \"Already we've seen 8,000 people who would have been affected by the cap move into jobs. This clearly demonstrates that the cap is having the desired impact.\"</p><p>However, in an open letter, Andrew Dilnot, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, said this claim was \"unsupported by the official statistics published by the department\". He added that the statistics used to support the statement had explicitly cautioned that the figures were \"not intended to show the additional numbers entering work as a direct result of the contact\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412837072|2013-10-11T06:13:48Z|3e53cffa8d8a408e43433013bf9eb4b3b8207b8a -->",

He also denied claims that families subject to a cap would be made homeless, arguing that \"the homelessness figures have hardly moved at all\".</p><p>Duncan Smith was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036tsn9/live\" title=\"\">speaking on Radio 4's Today programme </a>on the day a benefits cap trialled in four London boroughs was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jul/15/benefits-cap-rolled-out-britain\" title=\"\">expanded across the country</a>. The cap is set at just below £26,000 a household – around average earnings. Polling shows the move is the single most popular reform the government has made to the welfare system.</p><p>Results of the pilots released by the Department for Work and Pensions show 8,000 people were financially affected in the test areas, with many large families losing more than £100 a week. Only those in work, people entitled to a war widow(er) pension, disabled people and the sick are exempt.</p><p>Duncan Smith has already been criticised by the Office for National Statistics for claiming the cap had led to 8,000 people finding work. He was told by the ONS it was not possible to find any causal link between the cap and those finding work.</p><p>An unrepentant Duncan Smith told Today on Monday: \"You cannot absolutely prove those two things are connected – you cannot disprove what I said. I believe this to be right. I believe we are already seeing people going back to work who were not going back to work until this group were capped.\"</p><p>Pressed on claims made by Haringey council, one of the trial areas, that out of 740 households subject to the cap only 34 had found work, he said the BBC could always find politically motivated people to make that kind of remark. \"We have not published evidence in this. I believe I am right,\" said Duncan Smith, pointing to evidence from jobcentres.</p><p>He added that the principle was simple, saying: \"You cannot go on earning more money [while] out of work on benefits than those in work trying hard.\"</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-perceptions-of-the-benefit-cap-and-pre-implementation-impacts\" title=\"\">government's own polling on the cap </a>warns that the limited evidence it offers that people affected by the cap have moved into work should not be regarded as clear proof the policy is working.</p><p>The report states that: \"There is evidence that the policy has encouraged some claimants to take action to avoid the benefit cap before implementation\"</p><p>Of those claimants currently working and who knew about the cap, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check/2013/jul/15/benfit-cap-reality-check-is-it-working-iain-duncan-smith\" title=\"\">61% had found a job after being notified</a> that they would be affected. But the report says that \"this does not show causation\" - meaning that the claimants may have gone into work anyway.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ipsos Mori confirmed the poll did not offer conclusive evidence that the cap was working. \"It does not show causality. Iain Duncan Smith may be saying that this is what he believes to be the cause but he cannot say it offers proof.\"</p><p>On the effects of the benefits cap on those facing high housing costs, Duncan Smith said: \"We believe that in London there is plenty of accommodation and the vast majority of accommodation is available – a third of all rental accommodation in the private sector is available for people on social rents.</p><p>\"The great talk about thousands being made homeless has not come true. The homeless figures have hardly moved at all.\"</p><p>Duncan Smith said it was wrong for welfare claimants to live in houses where the rent is £50,000 or £100,000 a year, saying other families lived out of central London and commuted to work.</p><p>The reforms are due to save £275m in 2013-14 and £275m in 2014-15 (in cash terms) or £270m in 2013-14 and £265m in 2014-15 (in 2012-13 prices).</p><p>The Liberal Democrat former minister Sarah Teather criticised the plans saying \"I fear it's about the worst kind of politics, chasing populism at the expense of children's well-being is not politics that I care for very much, and I don't think we do ourselves as politicians or the British public very much good by following that line.\"</p><p>Duncan Smith denied he was punishing people, saying it was  \"no life to lead to accept the fact that you languish on benefits, trying to avoid ways of getting back to work\". He added: \"You put people into housing they cannot afford when they go back to work because the rules are you lose part of your housing benefit when your income goes up.\"</p><p>The cap, which limits combined benefits, will be rolled out across the rest of England, Scotland and Wales over the next 12 weeks.</p><p>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, accused Duncan Smith's department of operating on the basis of blind faith and guesswork after it published the Mori poll of 500 people \"who were notified within the last year that they would be capped, but who subsequently moved into work\".</p><p>The figures were apparently designed to show that the cap leads to employment, with over half of those who knew about the cap finding a job. But  many in the  relatively small sample  were already looking for a job, and said their chief barrier to work was the lack of opportunities.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/412839829|2013-10-11T06:13:48Z|3d900dd540ad55f7336afb0c204dd4c136a930c1 -->",
