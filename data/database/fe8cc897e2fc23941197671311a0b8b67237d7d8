        "body":"<p>Twice a week we publish the problems that will feature in a forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy\" title=\"\">Dear Jeremy advice column</a> in the Guardian Money supplement so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy's own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?</p><p></p><p><strong>For the past year I have been working as an account manager in media sales. Before this I worked as a media planner in an advertising agency for two years.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>When I graduated with a psychology degree in 2008, the recession had just hit and graduate jobs were hard to find, particularly in Ireland. I hadn't really figured out what I wanted to do – all I wanted was to start earning!</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Now, however, although I have a broad interest in the area of communications, I am struggling to get motivated by what I do. I would love to do something more meaningful but can't figure out how – I can't afford to go back to college to retrain. I am also worried that my lack of interest in my current role is going to start to show.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>I have volunteered at an arts festival and have given voluntary tuition for a secondary school student. Although I enjoyed doing both, I can't figure out how to make something like this my day job. How can I make the transition to a role that makes me feel I am making a difference? I am 28 and worried that if I don't do something now I'll never be able to break out.</strong></p><p></p><p>Do you need advice on a work issue?
