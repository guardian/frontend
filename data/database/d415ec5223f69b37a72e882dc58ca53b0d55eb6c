        "headline":"Scandal – box set review",
        "body":"<p>When the political drama Scandal launched in 2012, it seemed like a fairly standard US network show. It centred on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN7QcOCzUvE\" title=\"\">Olivia Pope</a>, a beautiful crisis management ninja, and the close-knit team who worshipped her. There was a brooding former love interest, who just happened to be the president of the United States, and a new case to crisis-manage every week.</p><p>Yes, those cases were more morally troubling than the average procedural (the team's awkward defence of a millionaire's son accused of rape, for example, or their attempts to hush up a notorious madam's client list). And yes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/kerry-washington\" title=\"\">Kerry Washington</a> gave a bravura performance as the tough-talking, super-stylish Pope, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/antwaunsargent/olivia-pope-always-perfectly-dressed\" title=\"\">an avenging angel in the sharpest of white suits and the highest of high heels</a>, barking \"It's handled!\" into her phone. But it didn't&nbsp;seem like much more than a well-made soap.&nbsp;</p><p>Then came the story of Amanda Tanner, a missing intern whose disappearance had echoes of the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/chandra/\" title=\"\">2001 Chandra Levy case</a>. Suddenly Scandal's first season, which aired here on More4 and is now out on box set, broke from its procedural constraints and unashamedly embraced melodrama. It became a high-octane blend of politics, paranoia and toxic romance, featuring plot twists so jarring they'd give you whiplash, and jawdropping flashbacks that showed the true nature of Pope's relationship with President Fitzgerald \"Fitz\" Grant.</p><p>The dialogue also became riper. The ice-cold first lady warned her rival: \"I'm going to need to take my husband back – because clearly I have to do everything for myself from now on.\" Meanwhile, a harassed Fitz demanded of Pope: \"Who are you right now?\" Her response was worthy of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ7nzIqc0f8\" title=\"\">Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington in Dynasty</a>: \"The woman who got you elected. So go be the man I voted for.\"</p><p>As the truth about Tanner's disappearance slowly emerges, so Pope's own layers are peeled back. We learn that, far from being Capitol Hill's golden girl, she is a woman with many skeletons in her closet – each one bringing a new shock, and revealing her to be a poisonous mess of co-dependency and betrayal. Shonda Rhimes, Scandal's creator, deserves huge praise for having the courage to make the first black female lead on US television in 38 years a flawed anti-heroine. And if Pope is screwed up, so is her team: Huck was a former black ops marine with a past involving torture and murder; Harrison served time for insider trading; and Quinn – well, let's just say Quinn has dark impulses.</p><p>Season one hurtles towards a climax that is simultaneously brilliant and crazy, featuring multiple betrayals, the forming of new alliances, and the uncovering of Quinn's secrets. However, all that turned out to be nothing compared to season two, currently on More4, which depicts an even more desperate world in which people will do anything – lie, cheat, steal, even kill – to cling on to power.</p><p>The key to Scandal is that it's not <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/04/aaron-sorkin-west-wing\" title=\"\">The West Wing</a>, that romantic dream upon a shining hill, but its opposite: a world where power is everything and corruption inevitable. It's not perfect. The plotting is over-the-top and the twists are sometimes ludicrous, but somehow it all works. Pope is tainted by what she did to get Fitz elected, and by what she's done to keep him there. A paranoid drama for paranoid times.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420249705|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|e5ada7437de34fa0947a8a6862421474a43d7434 -->",

        "headline":"Homeland's 'crazy Carrie' saga stereotypes mental health disorders",
        "body":"<p>Homeland's Carrie Mathison has bipolar disorder. In season one, we watched her suffer an onset of symptoms triggered by a bombing, and then because of those symptoms, she lost her job, jeopardised the safety of herself and her team, and was forced to begin a long journey back to employment and mental stability. It was painful and it was frustrating – and that's because it was realistic. Season two, on the other hand, was not realistic at all. And season three? We're teetering on the edge of mental health shaming.</p><p>I began watching the first season of Homeland two weeks before being diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/mental_health_a-z/7916_understanding_bipolar_disorder\">bipolar II</a> myself, and could immediately relate to certain symptoms and behaviours, and to Claire Daines' heartbreaking depiction of them. By season two, Carrie's mental health disorder has begun to act as a scapegoat for her poor decision-making. It has become the \"reason\" behind her behaviour, not merely an aspect of her life – and certainly not something she was actively learning to manage. In this season, Carrie's refusal to accept traditional treatment is just another chapter in the \"crazy Carrie\" saga. Considering how accurate its portrayal of mental illness was in season one, it is a shame that the show is wasting its opportunity to accurately reflect life with a mental health disorder as the show progresses.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/13/homeland-recap-season-three-episode-two\">last week's episode</a>, Dana spoke the first reasonable dialogue Homeland has given us ages: \"I'm not crazy,\" she told her mother. \"You're not either.\" What she meant was that she felt able to continue with her everyday life, despite her earlier suicide attempt. And so, too, could Carrie – bipolar disorder (type I or II) can be easily managed with the proper doctors, prescriptions, and therapy. Yet to Homeland writers, Carrie is increasingly becoming a mental health stereotype. And considering the popularity of the series, this is troublesome.</p><p>At this stage of the series, Carrie is off her lithium, she's symptomatic (manic, specifically: obsessive thoughts, inflated sense of self, irrationality, heightened sex drive, increased alcohol intake), and she's about to come face to face with the consequences of last season's \"bipolar\"-influenced decision-making, through the investigation. And what will come next? Yet more disturbing images of her being strapped to a hospital gurney with restraints?</p><p>Homeland's current storyline isn't just stereotypical; it's nonsensical. Carrie is smart and she's strong, so why would she suddenly wilfully neglect her mental health in favour of \"alternative\" treatments and character-atypical irrationality? Where is her doctor? Her therapists? <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfo/problems/bipolardisorder/bipolardisorder.aspx\">Is she bipolar I or II</a>? How did her symptoms get so far, and if her disorder isn't new, why isn't Carrie aware of her triggers and her symptoms? Every case is different, but most bipolar patients can tell you what comes next: after a few days of over-inflated, \"genius\"-type thinking, you experience the crash. So why isn't Carrie acknowledging this? Especially with a bipolar father, and especially after we saw her crash so hard in season one?</p><p>Homeland must answer these questions. It can take years for patients to find the perfect treatment plan, and as viewers, it would help us to better understand Carrie if we were to understand her way of thinking. The mental health stigma still lingers – especially with phrases such as \"mental disease\", which was tossed around throughout the season three premiere at will. If Homeland chooses to follow Carrie's storyline responsibly, this season could be important not only to the whole series, but to pop culture in general. However, it has to go all the way.</p><p>If the focus this season is going to be on Carrie's mental health, it should include the reasoning behind her behaviour. It has to explain what she means when she claims the drugs make her foggy. It has to explain why she's picking up guys at the liquor store and buying six bottles of vodka at a time. It has to explain why her stable father is frustrated by watching somebody he loves spiral so willingly. It has to explain why Carrie was so angry at the idea of being betrayed by someone like Saul – and the mortification, sadness, and even fear she felt after hearing him throw her under the bus.</p><p>Television is powerful, and should be powerful for everyone – not just for those who can directly relate to characters and their struggles. Breaking Bad is a case in point. Most of us can't relate to Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, or the meth business, yet the story is compelling and gut-wrenching enough for us to care and learn more. Homeland can do the same. Homeland's writers have an opportunity to tackle mental health stigmas responsibly, which means season three could be Homeland's most important chapter. But if it's done incorrectly – if Carrie's mental health is used only for sensationalism and to paint her into a \"crazy\" corner – it could do more harm than good.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238766|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|1d501744fede7154a5643ad3849030d4cf175d7f -->",

        "body":"<p>People often tell me that they have no idea how I can do standup. The idea of trying to make a large group of strangers laugh is, for many, absolutely petrifying – and it is – but there are ways of gradually developing the material that can ease the fear. For me, it has never been a case of sitting down in front of a computer. I tend to develop my rambling anecdotes by actually getting up and performing them. That's the joy/horror of stand up – if you have the germ of an idea that you think might be funny, there is a way of finding out if it's funny very quickly. In standup, the feedback is instantaneous, and if it fails you know you'll be off-stage and hiding in a short time.</p><p>I assumed writing for television would be pretty straightforward. I was wrong. Having total freedom, it turns out, is horrendous. One has to make the most basic decisions before a single word is written. Some decisions are easier than others. I knew I wanted it to be, in essence, a traditional sitcom. I grew up watching people tell stories using this format. Carla Lane's Butterflies seemed to be on in our house at all times when I was a kid, as did The Good Life. But it was Fawlty Towers that made me really sit up for the first time. Basil's incandescent rage made me howl. Then suddenly, some people went a step further - when The Young Ones arrived, my friends and I thought something had been truly written for us. My mum hated it, which was delightful, and the slapstick elements and sight gags in Man Down owe a great deal to it. It took me years to realise that the dysfunctional family set-up is as present in The Young Ones as it is in the sitcoms that delighted my parents. Most mirror what is going on in every house, every family – chaos and hidden affection. Much been written about the arrival of The Office and the death of the traditional sitcom, but it is not a massive leap to see that show as another example of a messed-up family stuck in a house together.</p><p>There were, therefore, some decisions that were easy to make. My middle-aged lead character Dan had to be trapped with his parents and in a job he hated. He is, like so many sitcom characters, fairly unsympathetic on the surface. He is a selfish idiot, but I hope that people will find themselves rooting for him ultimately. He tries to make things better but doesn't have the skills to do it. I was loathe to make him a teacher because of the inevitable lazy comparisons with The Inbetweeners, in which I played a headmaster, but I spent 13 years as a teacher, so making him anything else felt wrong.</p><p>What I learned fairly quickly is that trying to create a reasonably credible world and the characters that inhabit it on your own is a recipe for madness. Every decision you make has knock-on effects and trying to tell a simple story is in fact like putting together a jigsaw designed by Satan. This resulted in, to list but a few incidents, me pouring a kettle of water on the floor of my flat deliberately, destroying a perfectly good chest of drawers and one early morning calling an urban fox &quot;a prick&quot;.</p><p>But creating Man Down did eventually become a joy. If you have cast the right people for the roles – Rik Mayall was my ideal dad from the start – and if those actors are nice, actually filming a sitcom is wonderful. It was a blast from start to finish. How I kept a straight face during scenes in which Rik Mayall, one of my comedy heroes, was humping a wall, attacking me in a bear suit, cocking an eyebrow as he sat defecating on my toilet is a mystery to me. (Some shameful indications of my love of the puerile there). It also made me question why it is I feel the need to publicly humiliate myself. When a handler was setting a genuine attack dog on me, she informed me that just last week it had horribly bitten an intruder. You have to take a moment to wonder what you are punishing yourself for.</p><p>My family and ex-collegues in the teaching profession will be delighted when I put on the record that very few of the incidents that happen in Man Down actually happened in real life, but there is a more general truth to it. I wrote about a time when I was totally lost at sea, and I just took the humiliation of my character, Dan, to a more extreme place. My mum said, &quot;Anyone watching this will think you grew up in a mad house.&quot; I did. We all did.</p><p><em>Man Down begins on Friday at 9.30pm on Channel 4</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420169238|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|f2891e5b457da528fcac2d427bc840e18e83eef5 -->",

        "body":"<h2><strong>Truckers</strong><br />9pm, BBC1<br /></h2><p>Our second visit to Banks of England takes us into the life of young haulage honcho Martin. He takes tips on fleeing the shadow of his business-founding late father, while striving to modernise a workforce very much comfortable with the status quo. But events take a turn when it transpires Dad had an avowedly laissez-faire approach when it came to regulations. Martin vows to bring out his inner sod to whip the company into shape, an idea hopefully more successful than his extreme team-bonding jaunt. <em>Mark Jones</em></p><h2><strong>Peaky Blinders</strong><br />9pm, BBC2<br /></h2><p>It's not been an unambitious series; as intentions go, to make a post-first world war, Brummie version of Deadwood for Nick Cave fans is a pretty boutique one. In spite of its eccentricities and strong cast, however, something about it hasn't fully convinced. In this final episode, we find Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy) and gang looking forward to the Worcester races and a chance to dominate trackside betting. Inevitably, Inspector Campbell (Sam Neill) has his own thoughts on that. A showdown awaits. <em>John Robinson</em></p><h2><strong>Breathless</strong><br />9pm, ITV<br /></h2><p>Episode two of the medical drama, and various plots thicken. For Richard, back off a brief honeymoon, this means learning the truth about wife Jean's pregnancy. Elsewhere, a menopausal patient hits a life crisis, Lily is longing for a child, Angela has an admirer, and Mulligan reveals himself as a danger to the long-term happiness of Otto and his family. With its 1960s setting and ambiguous central character, Breathless may be marked out as a Mad Men clone, but strong performances and a sharp script more than compensate. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p><h2><strong>Educating Yorkshire</strong><br />9pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Like most 13-year-olds, Jack is a walking contradiction: sensitive but angry, funny and generous but disruptive in lessons, he has the voice of an angel with the simmering threat of lashing out just underneath. He's also on course to become Mr Mitchell's first permanent exclusion, despite the best efforts of the teachers at Thornhill, and his own promises to turn his bad behaviour around. The penultimate episode in what has been a highlight of 2013's television schedule; surely a Bafta looms large. <em>Bim Adewunmi</em></p><h2>Naked And Afraid<br />9pm, Discovery<br /></h2><p>This makes I'm A Celebrity look like a walk in a national park. Resembling some accursed Adam and Eve after the Fall (but sans fig leaves), stuntwoman Ky and writer Billy must survive 21 days in the gator-infested Louisiana swamplands without water or food. (Perverts note: All bits are pixilated. And, anyway, it's all about as erotic as, well, a river of thrashing crocodiles.) \"My feet hurt,\" observes Billy, with brilliant understatement. Completely terrifying, and shown here in a double bill – extra-naked, and extra-afraid. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p><p></p><h2>Scandal<br />10pm, More4<br /></h2><p>Olivia (Kerry Washington) is brought in to help a mother and CEO who once had an affair with a Supreme Court nominee, which creates friction with the White House. An enraged Cy (Jeff Perry) goes to work, culminating in a montage that neatly summarises how to trash someone's public reputation. Scandal is at its best when it stays focused on showing how politics and the media affect individuals; the continuing espionage plotline and the leaked intel business feel as if they belong in another show. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p><h2>Up All Night: The Nightclub Toilet<br />10pm, Channel 4<br /></h2><p>Debut of a series of documentaries that will portray British nightlife, presumably aimed, judging by the time slot, at people who have opted out of the whole ghastly shrieking mess and will enjoy being reminded of the sagacity of their choice. Tonight's instalment is set in the toilets of a nightclub in Crawley. The film focuses on the toilet attendants, who can't possibly be paid enough but for whom their intimate access to a ceaselessly replenishing fount of tawdry anecdotage is hopefully some compensation. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p><p></p><h2>American Football: Arizona v Seattle<br />1am, Sky Sports 1<br /></h2><p>Despite losing their undefeated record last week to the Indianapolis Colts and their talented quarterback Andrew Luck, the Seattle Seahawks will be largely happy with their start to the NFL season. That said, theirs looks a tight division, so wins against divisional rivals such as tonight's opponents the Arizona Cardinals might prove crucial in the race for the play-offs. Arizona, meanwhile, will look to a defence that restricted Carolina to two field goals last weekend. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420133080|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|7ca3e99be26d6aed972e60b3655b2939c59a92a0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Movie pitch: The Tunnel Under The River Kwai. So it's a second world war film, about a bunch of British PoWs who are forced by their Japanese captors to dig a tunnel under a Burmese river. OK, not so different to a not-so-differently titled David Lean movie, but in that one they went <em>over</em> the river, whereas this would be very much <em>under</em> it … No? They didn't do that during the south-east Asian campaign in the war, no burrowing? How about a romantic drama? The Tunnels of Madison County. Again no, there are no tunnels? What if we could get Jeff Tunnels … Back to the drawing board.</p><p>All right, that's not quite what's going on in <a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/the-tunnel\" title=\"\"><strong>The Tunnel</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic), the Anglo-French remake of the brilliant Danish-Swedish crime series The Bridge. Because obviously there is a tunnel under the Channel, linking the two countries, just as there is a bridge linking Denmark and Sweden. What The Tunnel does share with my silly movie ideas is its questionable value.</p><p>Not that it's bad. Not at all – it's atmospheric, intriguing, gripping, with interesting, complex characters and strong performances (from Clémence Poésy and Stephen Dillane as the leads). It's just that it's <em>exactly the same</em> as the (recent) original.</p><p>Maybe there will be more of an illegal immigrant thing going on, given the new location. And an exploration of the complex relationship between Britain and France, the entente (not always so) cordiale. Perhaps, like the American Office, it will start off in the same place, and then turn off and become something wonderful in its own right. Not yet, though; so far The Tunnel's not for turning.</p><p>A woman's body is found in the aforementioned tunnel, half in one country, half in another, causing their respective police forces to rattle their truncheons and batons (or whatever it is they carry) at each other. She – the dead lady – is French, though: a rightwing politician, so the gendarmerie take the case. When they go to pick her up, she comes apart in the middle, like a Russian doll. Her bottom half isn't even hers; it belongs – belonged – to a prostitute from Cardiff. The Brits, Dillane's Karl Roebuck specifically, are back on the case. And there follows a joint investigation – not always totally cooperative or <em>cordiale</em> – of spiralling murkiness and complexity.</p><p>It's not just broadly the same; individual scenes are identical. Big moments: twatty journalist trapped in car with time bomb, check. Little moments: Poésy's Elise Wasserman changing her top unselfconsciously in front of male colleagues. Personalities have been shipped in direct from Scandinavia: her implied (and slightly cardboard) Asperger's, his shambolic good humour. The smallest details too: his vasectomy, her Porsche. OK, different model and colour, but that's not enough to give the show its own identity. It even looks and feels similar.</p><p>The one obvious difference is, well, the obvious difference – that was a bridge, this is a tunnel. However magnificent an engineering feat the Channel tunnel is, it can't compete as a spectacular location with the Oresund Bridge. One-nil to the Scandis then.</p><p>It's pointless, my exasperated girlfriend, a massive fan of the original, announces. And she's got a point. The only possible reason for doing it – so soon and so identically – is to get rid of the subtitles. Except this has them! Because it's half in French.</p><p>There is already an American version, straddling the border between the US and Mexico. Maybe everywhere should do one. I'm thinking a North/South Korea collaboration would be good, though The Military Demarcation Line isn't the snappiest of titles (MDL perhaps, or DMZ?) Or in Roman times; then it could be The Wall. That works. I'll work on my pitch.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/hello-ladies\" title=\"\"><strong>Hello Ladies</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic) – Stephen Merchant's sitcom about a geeky Brit in LA … well, about a caricature of himself – is gentler, and less awkward and squirmy than his collaborations with you-know-who. Not ground breaking, but nice. Which sounds less enthusiastic than I meant it to. It's very likable.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/veep\" title=\"\"><strong>Veep</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic) returns, Armando Iannucci's rat-a-tat machine-gun-of-wit-and-words assault on America. I don't believe it, like I believed The Thick of It; it feels like an Englishman imposing Englishness on US politics. Still effing hilarious though.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420162150|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|47f91f24efe6cb31aea9d0b92c0182b94b5d2296 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong> </strong></p><p>The director who 50 years ago made the first episodes of Doctor Who has spoken of the reluctance of William Hartnell to play the Time Lord's first incarnation and said the BBC showed little faith in the programme.</p><p>Waris Hussein, who directed 10 episodes of the series that would become the longest-running science fiction show on television, recalled balking at the script for the first story in the debut series, An Unearthly Child.</p><p>Airing in November 1963, the first episode introduced Hartnell and the Tardis in a junkyard in London. Hussein said he was fine with this script but was rattled by the remaining three episodes, which featured a power struggle between stone-age factions (the debut story is sometimes referred to as 100,000 BC).</p><p>\"[I was] a graduate from Cambridge with honours, and you're directing this piece about cavemen in skins,\" he said in<a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-10-16/doctor-whos-first-director-bbc-had-no-faith-in-show--william-hartnell-didnt-want-to-do-it\" title=\"\"> an interview with the Radio Times's website</a>. \"'I thought, 'Where have I landed up in my life?'\"</p><p>It wasn't just Hussein who failed to grasp the potential of Doctor Who.He said the show's makers had struggled to secure a star to play the Doctor, with Hartnell the first choice of the producer, Verity Lambert. \"When we approached him, he didn't want to do it because he was doing well in films,\" said Hussein.</p><p>Hussein said there a major force within the BBC that had not wanted to go out on a limb with a sci-fi series.</p><p>The reticence is made clear in the Doctor Who writer Mark Gatiss's drama An Adventure in Time and Space, which fleshes out how the show made it to the small screen. \"The BBC had no faith in it,\" said Hussein. \"The fact was, they didn't want to make it.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420180134|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|ae75d67843204b64f1a0f61d951967f329b67a9f -->",

        "trailText":"<p><strong>Dan Martin:</strong> Though many fans consider it trashy, this Sylvester McCoy story is a great example of the show's maverick spirit – a pink noir, if you like</p>",
        "headline":"The Happiness Patrol: Doctor Who classic episode #16",
        "body":"<h2>The Happiness Patrol (16 November 1988)<br /></h2><p><em>SPOILER ALERT: We are discussing some of the Doctor Who adventures broadcast over the past 50 years. In this blog, we're looking at The Happiness Patrol. It contains spoilers about the entire story.</em></p><p>Doctor Who and gay people have a very special relationship, and we've done a lot for each other over the years. You're not supposed to generalise, of course, but there are reasons why The Happiness Patrol is widely regarded as the show's gayest story that go above and beyond it starting off with the Tardis painted pink.</p><p>The Doctor and Ace arrive on the planet of Terra Alpha to investigate claims of government wrongdoing. Their intel was correct, but not for the reasons they were expecting. Here, sadness is punishable by death, and this rule is enforced by a pink-backcombed \"Happiness Patrol\". Their leader Helen A, played by Sheila Hancock in a red frightwig, spends her days petting a growling lapdog monster named Fifi. Oh yes, The Happiness Patrol is camper than a Kardashian, lavishly and fabulously so. It has a monster made out of sweets. It is a pink noir, if you like.</p><p>Even though the musical motif is the blues, a poetic harmonica refrain that punctuates the allegory, its central theme – of a profound sadness seeping through a colourful surface – is pure disco. This is the Donna Summer of Doctor Who stories.</p><p>That's not the only reason I love The Happiness Patrol, however. Though considered trashy by many, it's a die-cut example of the maverick spirit that was returning to Who with the McCoy era. There's plenty to love about the darker, deeper tones of the following year (I would have The Curse of Fenric if I could have more McCoy stories), but there's something perfect, poetic and whole about this piece. It has sharper teeth than stuff such as Paradise Towers from the year before. It's not only a political satire on Thatcherism, it's also a satirical inversion of Doctor Who itself. The Doctor arrives on a planet and overthrows a government and saves a populace by allowing them the freedom to be miserable. They even say it out loud at the end – he gives them back the blues.</p><p>It's a wonderfully simple and poetic moral – and, as Helen A realises at the end, to be truly felt, real happiness must exist next to true sadness.</p><h2>Life aboard the Tardis<br /></h2><p>Ace is still new to the game, and yet you can already see her character becoming  so much more than just the mouthy tomboy who was bashing Daleks about with baseball bats in the previous story. The way she counsels Susan Q (a young Lesley Dunlop) shows how much she's growing as a result of the travels with the Doctor. The empathetic young woman who would unravel so movingly the following year in Ghost Light and Fenric is already forming. Yes, I love Ace.</p><p>Similarly, with the Doctor, the darker hues of this version have now been firmly rooted after his scalding of Davros last week. It's a stinging dismissal of Helen A at the end, admonishing her with talk of \"the girl who likes to feel the rain upon her face, or to enjoy her favourite season of autumn\". <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Cartmel_Masterplan\" title=\"\">The Cartmell Masterplan</a> is already happening. You can even sense the beginnings of the Oncoming Storm …</p><h2>Behind the sofa<br /></h2><p>A garishly camp story might not immediately come over as something that's supposed to be scary, of course. As mentioned above, the chill comes with the vicious satire of gaudy consumerism and whatnot. But let's not forget the Kandyman, one of the most notorious monsters of the era, for better reasons or worse. And behold the deathless line: \"It's quite simple, created as you are out of glucose-based substances, your joints need constant movement to avoid coagulation. You're turning into a slab of toffee.\"</p><p>What could be better?</p><h2>Behind the scenes<br /></h2><p>The show would invite further controversy years later in 2010, when somebody happened upon Andrew Cartmel's autobiography, and a line that he'd said in his BBC interview about wanting to overthrow the government. \"The implication was that the BBC was a nest of communists and that I'd been sitting at the BBC employment panel and I said I wanted to overthrow the government and they all took me for a sherry afterwards,\" he said.  \"John (Nathan-Turner) said, 'Oh you can't do that on Doctor Who, all you can do is say that purple people and green people are equal and should live in harmony,' and that was that. But the implication was that we were all a bunch of Marxist nasties seeking to undermine the liberties of the time. It was much less interesting than that.\"</p><p>Certainly, there <em>was</em> a liberal agenda at the time, one that has been there, broadly, for most of the show's history. They were advised not to talk about Helen A being based on Margaret Thatcher at the time – it's probably reductive to suggest that strong megalomaniacal female would have to be – but that's what they did. \"I'm not sure at what point we decided to write her like Thatcher. It probably came from Graeme [Curry, writer] and I did nothing but encourage it.\" said Cartmel. They didn't brief Sheila Hancock either, he said, \"but she saw right away what we were getting at and boy did she run with it.\"</p><h2>Fragments<br /></h2><p>• \"Nobody will shed any tears over me. And even if they did they wouldn't be allowed.\"</p><p>• Tom MacRae, writer of The Girl Who Waited, writes in the new anthology The Doctor: His Lives and Times: \"The Happiness Patrol made me cry. It was the first time Doctor Who had ever done that. I'd been thrilled before. Breathless with excitement before. Gripped with tension at a cliffhanger mixed with frustration I'd have to wait a week to see what happened before. Once or twice, I'd even been scared. But The Happiness Patrol was the first time Doctor Who had made me cry. It was that bit at the end, when Helen A's horrid mini-dog-beast Fifi died, and Helen A started sobbing, and suddenly this vile little puppet I'd loved to hate for the last three weeks … well, suddenly it felt real to me. Fifi's death felt real.

        "body":"<p>If I were Joe Grundy, Ambridge's oldest inhabitant, I would be developing a severe nervous twitch. Not a day goes by (except Saturday, when nothing happens at all) but someone remarks how frail he looks.</p><p>\"All the fight's gone out of him\", \"'E can't even do up 'is buttons\", \"'E's 'ardly touched 'is sausages.\" You are ominously reminded of Old Joshua Merryweather – <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3ks4qtAx-A\" title=\"\">aka Tony Hancock</a> in the fictional radio show The Bowmans – who&nbsp;one day opened his script to discover he had fallen into a threshing machine.</p><p>Old Joe lost his mojo when, after a tequila or three, he fell and broke his wrist at Grey Gables. \"Laughter turned to gasps of horror,\" as the Borchester Echo put it. Caroline, the owner, is terse: \"The press make it So Much Worse.\" And Joe's son, Ed, is cutting up rough: \"Sorry don't butter no parsnips!\" The Grundys are the last repository of arcane country lore like this. If Joe goes, we will all be quite at sea about our parsnips.</p><p>I declare an interest here. Every soap used to have room for a crusty old character, cluttering up the place and dispensing whiskery wisdom. I&nbsp;might mention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2010/nov/21/coronation-street-television\" title=\"\">Ena Sharples</a>. I might speak of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQSvVphCJYg\" title=\"\">Walter Gabriel</a>. Not any more. I suppose they are all in care homes. I&nbsp;feel I must strike a feeble blow for, as Coward put it acidly, elderly actresses forgetting their lines.</p><p>Meanwhile Rob, who has been deflowering Ambridge's rose, Helen Archer, has vanished suddenly like a rabbit up a burrow – as Brian, hitherto Ambridge's leading lothario, put it. Surely it's a rabbit <em>down</em> a burrow, or a rat <em>up</em> a drainpipe? In Rob's case, the latter. Happily, their passionate panting&nbsp;(surprisingly blush-making on radio) was interrupted by the arrival of 100 German heifers. And, last week, by a phone call from Rob's wife.</p><p>Not a very merry month. We can only look forward – albeit nervously – to Linda's feminist Christmas panto, Robin Hood and his Merrie Women.</p><p><em>A Month in Ambridge returns on 13&nbsp;November</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420031028|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|e09419bee45e35161b5437fe12d10e047832502a -->",

        "headline":"Scandal – box set review",
        "body":"<p>When the political drama Scandal launched in 2012, it seemed like a fairly standard US network show. It centred on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN7QcOCzUvE\" title=\"\">Olivia Pope</a>, a beautiful crisis management ninja, and the close-knit team who worshipped her. There was a brooding former love interest, who just happened to be the president of the United States, and a new case to crisis-manage every week.</p><p>Yes, those cases were more morally troubling than the average procedural (the team's awkward defence of a millionaire's son accused of rape, for example, or their attempts to hush up a notorious madam's client list). And yes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/kerry-washington\" title=\"\">Kerry Washington</a> gave a bravura performance as the tough-talking, super-stylish Pope, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/antwaunsargent/olivia-pope-always-perfectly-dressed\" title=\"\">an avenging angel in the sharpest of white suits and the highest of high heels</a>, barking \"It's handled!\" into her phone. But it didn't&nbsp;seem like much more than a well-made soap.&nbsp;</p><p>Then came the story of Amanda Tanner, a missing intern whose disappearance had echoes of the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/chandra/\" title=\"\">2001 Chandra Levy case</a>. Suddenly Scandal's first season, which aired here on More4 and is now out on box set, broke from its procedural constraints and unashamedly embraced melodrama. It became a high-octane blend of politics, paranoia and toxic romance, featuring plot twists so jarring they'd give you whiplash, and jawdropping flashbacks that showed the true nature of Pope's relationship with President Fitzgerald \"Fitz\" Grant.</p><p>The dialogue also became riper. The ice-cold first lady warned her rival: \"I'm going to need to take my husband back – because clearly I have to do everything for myself from now on.\" Meanwhile, a harassed Fitz demanded of Pope: \"Who are you right now?\" Her response was worthy of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ7nzIqc0f8\" title=\"\">Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington in Dynasty</a>: \"The woman who got you elected. So go be the man I voted for.\"</p><p>As the truth about Tanner's disappearance slowly emerges, so Pope's own layers are peeled back. We learn that, far from being Capitol Hill's golden girl, she is a woman with many skeletons in her closet – each one bringing a new shock, and revealing her to be a poisonous mess of co-dependency and betrayal. Shonda Rhimes, Scandal's creator, deserves huge praise for having the courage to make the first black female lead on US television in 38 years a flawed anti-heroine. And if Pope is screwed up, so is her team: Huck was a former black ops marine with a past involving torture and murder; Harrison served time for insider trading; and Quinn – well, let's just say Quinn has dark impulses.</p><p>Season one hurtles towards a climax that is simultaneously brilliant and crazy, featuring multiple betrayals, the forming of new alliances, and the uncovering of Quinn's secrets. However, all that turned out to be nothing compared to season two, currently on More4, which depicts an even more desperate world in which people will do anything – lie, cheat, steal, even kill – to cling on to power.</p><p>The key to Scandal is that it's not <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/04/aaron-sorkin-west-wing\" title=\"\">The West Wing</a>, that romantic dream upon a shining hill, but its opposite: a world where power is everything and corruption inevitable. It's not perfect. The plotting is over-the-top and the twists are sometimes ludicrous, but somehow it all works. Pope is tainted by what she did to get Fitz elected, and by what she's done to keep him there. A paranoid drama for paranoid times.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420249705|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|e5ada7437de34fa0947a8a6862421474a43d7434 -->",

        "headline":"Homeland's 'crazy Carrie' saga stereotypes mental health disorders",
        "body":"<p>Homeland's Carrie Mathison has bipolar disorder. In season one, we watched her suffer an onset of symptoms triggered by a bombing, and then because of those symptoms, she lost her job, jeopardised the safety of herself and her team, and was forced to begin a long journey back to employment and mental stability. It was painful and it was frustrating – and that's because it was realistic. Season two, on the other hand, was not realistic at all. And season three? We're teetering on the edge of mental health shaming.</p><p>I began watching the first season of Homeland two weeks before being diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/mental_health_a-z/7916_understanding_bipolar_disorder\">bipolar II</a> myself, and could immediately relate to certain symptoms and behaviours, and to Claire Daines' heartbreaking depiction of them. By season two, Carrie's mental health disorder has begun to act as a scapegoat for her poor decision-making. It has become the \"reason\" behind her behaviour, not merely an aspect of her life – and certainly not something she was actively learning to manage. In this season, Carrie's refusal to accept traditional treatment is just another chapter in the \"crazy Carrie\" saga. Considering how accurate its portrayal of mental illness was in season one, it is a shame that the show is wasting its opportunity to accurately reflect life with a mental health disorder as the show progresses.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/13/homeland-recap-season-three-episode-two\">last week's episode</a>, Dana spoke the first reasonable dialogue Homeland has given us ages: \"I'm not crazy,\" she told her mother. \"You're not either.\" What she meant was that she felt able to continue with her everyday life, despite her earlier suicide attempt. And so, too, could Carrie – bipolar disorder (type I or II) can be easily managed with the proper doctors, prescriptions, and therapy. Yet to Homeland writers, Carrie is increasingly becoming a mental health stereotype. And considering the popularity of the series, this is troublesome.</p><p>At this stage of the series, Carrie is off her lithium, she's symptomatic (manic, specifically: obsessive thoughts, inflated sense of self, irrationality, heightened sex drive, increased alcohol intake), and she's about to come face to face with the consequences of last season's \"bipolar\"-influenced decision-making, through the investigation. And what will come next? Yet more disturbing images of her being strapped to a hospital gurney with restraints?</p><p>Homeland's current storyline isn't just stereotypical; it's nonsensical. Carrie is smart and she's strong, so why would she suddenly wilfully neglect her mental health in favour of \"alternative\" treatments and character-atypical irrationality? Where is her doctor? Her therapists? <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfo/problems/bipolardisorder/bipolardisorder.aspx\">Is she bipolar I or II</a>? How did her symptoms get so far, and if her disorder isn't new, why isn't Carrie aware of her triggers and her symptoms? Every case is different, but most bipolar patients can tell you what comes next: after a few days of over-inflated, \"genius\"-type thinking, you experience the crash. So why isn't Carrie acknowledging this? Especially with a bipolar father, and especially after we saw her crash so hard in season one?</p><p>Homeland must answer these questions. It can take years for patients to find the perfect treatment plan, and as viewers, it would help us to better understand Carrie if we were to understand her way of thinking. The mental health stigma still lingers – especially with phrases such as \"mental disease\", which was tossed around throughout the season three premiere at will. If Homeland chooses to follow Carrie's storyline responsibly, this season could be important not only to the whole series, but to pop culture in general. However, it has to go all the way.</p><p>If the focus this season is going to be on Carrie's mental health, it should include the reasoning behind her behaviour. It has to explain what she means when she claims the drugs make her foggy. It has to explain why she's picking up guys at the liquor store and buying six bottles of vodka at a time. It has to explain why her stable father is frustrated by watching somebody he loves spiral so willingly. It has to explain why Carrie was so angry at the idea of being betrayed by someone like Saul – and the mortification, sadness, and even fear she felt after hearing him throw her under the bus.</p><p>Television is powerful, and should be powerful for everyone – not just for those who can directly relate to characters and their struggles. Breaking Bad is a case in point. Most of us can't relate to Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, or the meth business, yet the story is compelling and gut-wrenching enough for us to care and learn more. Homeland can do the same. Homeland's writers have an opportunity to tackle mental health stigmas responsibly, which means season three could be Homeland's most important chapter. But if it's done incorrectly – if Carrie's mental health is used only for sensationalism and to paint her into a \"crazy\" corner – it could do more harm than good.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238766|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|1d501744fede7154a5643ad3849030d4cf175d7f -->",

        "headline":"The Tunnel; Hello Ladies; Veep - TV review",
        "body":"<p>Movie pitch: The Tunnel Under The River Kwai. So it's a second world war film, about a bunch of British PoWs who are forced by their Japanese captors to dig a tunnel under a Burmese river. OK, not so different to a not-so-differently titled David Lean movie, but in that one they went <em>over</em> the river, whereas this would be very much <em>under</em> it … No? They didn't do that during the south-east Asian campaign in the war, no burrowing? How about a romantic drama? The Tunnels of Madison County. Again no, there are no tunnels? What if we could get Jeff Tunnels … Back to the drawing board.</p><p>All right, that's not quite what's going on in <a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/the-tunnel\" title=\"\"><strong>The Tunnel</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic), the Anglo-French remake of the brilliant Danish-Swedish crime series The Bridge. Because obviously there is a tunnel under the Channel, linking the two countries, just as there is a bridge linking Denmark and Sweden. What The Tunnel does share with my silly movie ideas is its questionable value.</p><p>Not that it's bad. Not at all – it's atmospheric, intriguing, gripping, with interesting, complex characters and strong performances (from Clémence Poésy and Stephen Dillane as the leads). It's just that it's <em>exactly the same</em> as the (recent) original.</p><p>Maybe there will be more of an illegal immigrant thing going on, given the new location. And an exploration of the complex relationship between Britain and France, the entente (not always so) cordiale. Perhaps, like the American Office, it will start off in the same place, and then turn off and become something wonderful in its own right. Not yet, though; so far The Tunnel's not for turning.</p><p>A woman's body is found in the aforementioned tunnel, half in one country, half in another, causing their respective police forces to rattle their truncheons and batons (or whatever it is they carry) at each other. She – the dead lady – is French, though: a rightwing politician, so the gendarmerie take the case. When they go to pick her up, she comes apart in the middle, like a Russian doll. Her bottom half isn't even hers; it belongs – belonged – to a prostitute from Cardiff. The Brits, Dillane's Karl Roebuck specifically, are back on the case. And there follows a joint investigation – not always totally cooperative or <em>cordiale</em> – of spiralling murkiness and complexity.</p><p>It's not just broadly the same; individual scenes are identical. Big moments: twatty journalist trapped in car with time bomb, check. Little moments: Poésy's Elise Wasserman changing her top unselfconsciously in front of male colleagues. Personalities have been shipped in direct from Scandinavia: her implied (and slightly cardboard) Asperger's, his shambolic good humour. The smallest details too: his vasectomy, her Porsche. OK, different model and colour, but that's not enough to give the show its own identity. It even looks and feels similar.</p><p>The one obvious difference is, well, the obvious difference – that was a bridge, this is a tunnel. However magnificent an engineering feat the Channel tunnel is, it can't compete as a spectacular location with the Oresund Bridge. One-nil to the Scandis then.</p><p>It's pointless, my exasperated girlfriend, a massive fan of the original, announces. And she's got a point. The only possible reason for doing it – so soon and so identically – is to get rid of the subtitles. Except this has them! Because it's half in French.</p><p>There is already an American version, straddling the border between the US and Mexico. Maybe everywhere should do one. I'm thinking a North/South Korea collaboration would be good, though The Military Demarcation Line isn't the snappiest of titles (MDL perhaps, or DMZ?) Or in Roman times; then it could be The Wall. That works. I'll work on my pitch.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/hello-ladies\" title=\"\"><strong>Hello Ladies</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic) – Stephen Merchant's sitcom about a geeky Brit in LA … well, about a caricature of himself – is gentler, and less awkward and squirmy than his collaborations with you-know-who. Not ground breaking, but nice. Which sounds less enthusiastic than I meant it to. It's very likable.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/veep\" title=\"\"><strong>Veep</strong></a> (Sky Atlantic) returns, Armando Iannucci's rat-a-tat machine-gun-of-wit-and-words assault on America. I don't believe it, like I believed The Thick of It; it feels like an Englishman imposing Englishness on US politics. Still effing hilarious though.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420162150|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|47f91f24efe6cb31aea9d0b92c0182b94b5d2296 -->",

        "headline":"Five things Ben Wheatley could do to Doctor Who",
        "body":"<p>Whenever we hear exciting news about Doctor Who, it's usually to do with new actors joining the show. Over the past couple of years we've had a new companion, a new Doctor, a few returnees and even a new … whatever it is that John Hurt is playing. Now there's some behind-the-camera news that is just as thrilling, with the announcement that Ben Wheatley, one of Britain's most talented film directors, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24521790\" title=\"\">has signed on to direct the first two episodes of Peter Capaldi's tenure</a>. But what could he bring to the show?</p><h2>1. His own people<br /></h2><p>Directors like to work with people they have already established a rapport and a shorthand with, as it saves a lot of time cutting out any getting-to-know-you awkwardness. In his most recent movie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/04/a-field-in-england-review\" title=\"\">A Field in England</a>, Wheatley harnessed (literally; more on that in a minute) the talents of Reece Shearsmith. Shearsmith's League of Gentlemen cohort Mark Gatiss, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/09/mark-gatiss-drama-creation-doctor-who\" title=\"\">a lifelong Whovian</a>, was easily absorbed into Doctor Who as both performer and writer, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jul/10/reece-shearsmith-very-unsure-of-myself\" title=\"\">Shearsmith projects an altogether more unusual and dangerous energy</a>, the sort that finds a fit on shows such as Catterick and Psychoville. He's busy with his mysterious new project Inside No. 9, but surely he could find time for the Timelord. There are other actors Wheatley has worked with who would be great for Doctor Who, such as the writer/performer duo from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/29/sightseers-review\" title=\"\">Sightseers</a>, Alice Lowe and Steve Oram, or Neil Maskell and Michael Smiley, the terrifying hitmen from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/01/kill-list-film-review\" title=\"\">Kill List</a>.</p><h2>2. A mix-and-match approach to genres<br /></h2><p>It's not just about what new elements Wheatley can bring to the Who table, it's how he can align his talents with things the show is already great at. Wheatley's film work has shown he has a nimble ability to flit from one genre to another. Kill List jumped rails several times, going from kitchen-sink to hitman to supernatural drama with ease. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7cc8pVX4pY\">Sightseers</a> combined the holiday movie with the serial killer genre, while still being a very funny comedy. A Field in England was a psychedelic melting pot of period war movie, acid flick and God knows what else. Doctor Who also goes for variety: in the last series alone we went from Victorian England to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUw8fE6S1eU\">a dinosaur-infested spaceship</a>, the American old west, a cold war submarine and alien worlds such as the gloomy graveyard planet of Trenzalore. Maybe Wheatley can bring even more genre-based mixing and matching.</p><h2>3. A new, unusual soundtrack<br /></h2><p>Murray Gold's enthusiastic scoring for Doctor Who has as many detractors as fans. He can pack out places like the Albert Hall or the Cardiff Millennium Dome with ease for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/14/doctor-who-prom-review\" title=\"\">his Who concerts</a>, but the comments section for any episode blog is usually littered with those who claim he is overegging an already very eggy pudding. Wheatley has used composer <a href=\"http://www.afieldinengland.com/masterclass/people/james-williams/\" title=\"\">Jim Williams</a> on all his movies to great effect (these soundtracks are well worth tracking down, by the way), but it's unlikely Wheatley will be able to bring him on board. However, in the last series we had The Cult's Fire Woman and Duran Duran's Hungry Like the Wolf popping up, so Wheatley has potential to use his left-of-centre tastes. In A Field in England he used the track Chernobyl by Fuck Buttons duo Blanck Mass. Chernobyl, coupled with Reece Shearsmith's upsetting performance, turned what is basically a shot of a man tied to a rope exiting a tent into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzLnRXtHO0M\" title=\"\">one of the most memorable and unusual moments for British cinema in 2013</a>. Imagine what a similarly well-chosen obscurity could do for Doctor Who?</p><h2>4. Cinematic ambition<br /></h2><p>Doctor Who has always had an eye on the big screen, liberally &quot;borrowing&quot; from movies old and new. Recently, for instance, the haunted house-themed episode Hide seemed to be vigorously nodding in the direction of Robert Wise's classic spook movie The Haunting. Wheatley is one of our most cine-literate directors. You can see he draws inspiration from directors such as Nic Roeg, Alejandro Jodorowsky and the Kens, Russell and Loach. Doctor Who's recent western tale, A Town Called Mercy, was pretty good, but imagine if it looked and felt more like Wheatley's Django meets Zardoz <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg2vpkGQadM\" title=\"\">music video for Editors.</a> That would really be something.</p><h2>5. Precedent<br /></h2><p>In the US, movie directors often take on a TV episode. Recently, Looper's Rian Johnson helmed Ozymandias, one of the best episodes of Breaking Bad, and Jonathan Demme added his clout to HBO's Enlightenment. So perhaps Wheatley's involvement will make other British movie directors realise that, while they're probably not going to get to do a Bond movie, there is another iconic British figure they can get involved with in Doctor Who. Wheatley's production company, Rook Films, is currently producing the new film from Berberian Sound Studio's Peter Strickland, The Duke of Burgundy. Imagine what an unusual talent like Strickland could bring to the show. Or how about a Doctor Who directed by Edgar Wright? Or Duncan Jones? This could be the start of something incredible.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420014223|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|6b44a9e426307b211488dea1f63ec7dbe67a657a -->",

        "body":"<p>People often tell me that they have no idea how I can do standup. The idea of trying to make a large group of strangers laugh is, for many, absolutely petrifying – and it is – but there are ways of gradually developing the material that can ease the fear. For me, it has never been a case of sitting down in front of a computer. I tend to develop my rambling anecdotes by actually getting up and performing them. That's the joy/horror of stand up – if you have the germ of an idea that you think might be funny, there is a way of finding out if it's funny very quickly. In standup, the feedback is instantaneous, and if it fails you know you'll be off-stage and hiding in a short time.</p><p>I assumed writing for television would be pretty straightforward. I was wrong. Having total freedom, it turns out, is horrendous. One has to make the most basic decisions before a single word is written. Some decisions are easier than others. I knew I wanted it to be, in essence, a traditional sitcom. I grew up watching people tell stories using this format. Carla Lane's Butterflies seemed to be on in our house at all times when I was a kid, as did The Good Life. But it was Fawlty Towers that made me really sit up for the first time. Basil's incandescent rage made me howl. Then suddenly, some people went a step further - when The Young Ones arrived, my friends and I thought something had been truly written for us. My mum hated it, which was delightful, and the slapstick elements and sight gags in Man Down owe a great deal to it. It took me years to realise that the dysfunctional family set-up is as present in The Young Ones as it is in the sitcoms that delighted my parents. Most mirror what is going on in every house, every family – chaos and hidden affection. Much been written about the arrival of The Office and the death of the traditional sitcom, but it is not a massive leap to see that show as another example of a messed-up family stuck in a house together.</p><p>There were, therefore, some decisions that were easy to make. My middle-aged lead character Dan had to be trapped with his parents and in a job he hated. He is, like so many sitcom characters, fairly unsympathetic on the surface. He is a selfish idiot, but I hope that people will find themselves rooting for him ultimately. He tries to make things better but doesn't have the skills to do it. I was loathe to make him a teacher because of the inevitable lazy comparisons with The Inbetweeners, in which I played a headmaster, but I spent 13 years as a teacher, so making him anything else felt wrong.</p><p>What I learned fairly quickly is that trying to create a reasonably credible world and the characters that inhabit it on your own is a recipe for madness. Every decision you make has knock-on effects and trying to tell a simple story is in fact like putting together a jigsaw designed by Satan. This resulted in, to list but a few incidents, me pouring a kettle of water on the floor of my flat deliberately, destroying a perfectly good chest of drawers and one early morning calling an urban fox &quot;a prick&quot;.</p><p>But creating Man Down did eventually become a joy. If you have cast the right people for the roles – Rik Mayall was my ideal dad from the start – and if those actors are nice, actually filming a sitcom is wonderful. It was a blast from start to finish. How I kept a straight face during scenes in which Rik Mayall, one of my comedy heroes, was humping a wall, attacking me in a bear suit, cocking an eyebrow as he sat defecating on my toilet is a mystery to me. (Some shameful indications of my love of the puerile there). It also made me question why it is I feel the need to publicly humiliate myself. When a handler was setting a genuine attack dog on me, she informed me that just last week it had horribly bitten an intruder. You have to take a moment to wonder what you are punishing yourself for.</p><p>My family and ex-collegues in the teaching profession will be delighted when I put on the record that very few of the incidents that happen in Man Down actually happened in real life, but there is a more general truth to it. I wrote about a time when I was totally lost at sea, and I just took the humiliation of my character, Dan, to a more extreme place. My mum said, &quot;Anyone watching this will think you grew up in a mad house.&quot; I did. We all did.</p><p><em>Man Down begins on Friday at 9.30pm on Channel 4</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420169238|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|f2891e5b457da528fcac2d427bc840e18e83eef5 -->",

Kimberley is surely a favourite to win. But has Frances botched her chances with lack-lustre flavour? The huddle is tense and Sue looks emotional. Paul says Ruby's flavour wins for him. Hmmm. I can't call it. They hated all of them. The picky beggars.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9d41e4b0bbc67cfff299\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:54:37.541+01:00\">8.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Beca's banoffee effort looks like a big banana and chocolate sandwich. I don't see this as a bad thing. &quot;It's very very sweet,&quot; says Mary. And Paul says it tastes artificial. They are being such bitches this week.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9d0be4b0010b6627a7c7\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:53:34.855+01:00\">8.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ruby's corner is sagging. There are &quot;issues&quot; again, says Paul. She is just waiting for them to finish so she can hurl herself into the stream next door. Paul says the textures are great. BUT, it hasn't got the finish. It's not pretty enough, Ruby.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9cc4e4b0ebb74892f264\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:52:39.616+01:00\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kimberley's is like modern art. An acquired taste. Her chocolate has lost its sheen and Paul has noticed. He says he can only taste the chocolate. Mary consoles that there are some nice textures in there but it's a disappointment.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9c7be4b0760efba2ad8d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:51:29.168+01:00\">8.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ruby looks pensively depressed. Everyone else is steely. How did Frances get her writing on the cake so neat? How? Her layers look sharp and neat like Patrick Batemen's pencil collection. &quot;I'm not getting the lavender,&quot; says Paul almost sarcastically after telling her to go easy on the lavender. Ouch.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9c4fe4b0ebb74892f263\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:50:08.221+01:00\">8.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And stop.

She is brimming with confidence and optimism as usual. Kimberley says &quot;It's not perfect&quot; but she would obviously shoot herself if it wasn't.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9b7ee4b0ebb74892f261\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:47:49.027+01:00\">8.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Every layer of these opera cakes must be thin and even. Think dried lasagne slices layered up with Nutella, aesthetically. The bakers can freeze each layer as it goes on, tensely waiting by the ice box, cursing under their breath.</p> <p>Frances is being clever again and making a Soap Opera cake. Hoping for a tiny Frank Butcher, naked and in a revolving bow-tie on the top.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9b5ce4b0ebb74892f260\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:45:59.324+01:00\">8.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Mel's having a little Generation Game go at icing a cake there. Nice. Who can see the &quot;It's not over til the fat lady sings&quot; line coming a mile off.

The opera cake is French, surprisingly, and was inspired by ludicrous gold-leaf French architecture with all twiddly bits on it. A nice French chef explains the caffeine in the coffee layer is also useful to keep punters awake during particularly long operas. I want to see one big enough to get me through the whole Ring Cycle.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9ab5e4b0760efba2ad85\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:43:28.322+01:00\">8.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>&quot;That lavender could kill or make that dish,&quot; says Paul of Frances. I imagine Poirot in a study, surrounded by ingredients. The lavender, reclining on a chaise longue is looking shifty and smoking a cigarette.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9a7ce4b0760efba2ad84\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:42:39.608+01:00\">8.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>One and half hours left until someone's journey (for it is a journey) is over. Have you noticed they haven't bothered with a history bit this week? No time. Too much tension to film. Must not break the tension or sense of false jeopardy. It's a balancing act.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9a20e4b0ebb74892f25e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:41:44.130+01:00\">8.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kimberley is experimenting with a lime jelly layer. Why? Why would you involve something which takes time to set? Is she trying to give herself a hernia? She's also making chocolate caramel twills which she will fill with truffles. Is she making truffles too? She couldn't be less of an underdog now if she tried. I am going right off her.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d99e5e4b0ebb74892f25d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:39:55.745+01:00\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Beca is putting dry banana chips in her sponge. And banana essence. And real bananas. I wonder what her cake will taste of?</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d995ce4b0760efba2ad82\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:39:11.746+01:00\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Folding is one of the most counter-intuitive methods in baking. I just want to get in there with the spoon and churn everything up. Or I &quot;just dollop&quot; ingredients in ala Ruby. I've no patience with all the folding.</p> <p>The traditional ganache in an opera cake is usually chocolate so of course Frances is going with white chocolate, French lavender and lemon. It's as folk opera cake. So Bellowhead rendered in sugar and eggs. Mmm, lovely. *frowny face*</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d98f7e4b0ebb74892f25b\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:36:54.256+01:00\">8.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So it's a coffee and chocolate-based affair traditionally. Sounds a bit rich for my blood. Paul and Mary hype things up as usual saying that this is one of the hardest cakes to make. The sponge is made from stiffly beaten egg whites and ground almonds. One of my signature bakes (yes, I have those) is a ground almond and citrus cake. Quite delicious with brambles and sour cream. *Nigella finger suck*</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d98b7e4b0760efba2ad7f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:35:03.484+01:00\">8.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">The show-stopper</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ruby and Beca seem to be in the sing-off, so to speak. The final challenge is an opera cake. I think this means layers, grand design and a result fit to appear in a Go Compare advert.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9837e4b0ebb74892f258\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:33:57.447+01:00\">8.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Mary and Paul like Frances' but the roll is too loose. Kimberley's done everything perfectly. Beca's fruit is unevenly distributed. Paul says Ruby's one has &quot;issues&quot;. Her roll is small, the mouse is solid. Ruby's dinosaur diving board juts disconsolately. She is last. Beca is third. Frances is only second. And of course perfect Kimberley, the new Christine, is first. Perfection, they say. She grins insufferably. Ruby says that she knew she'd come last. You can't just say that every time until you're proven right.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9813e4b0ebb74892f257\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:31:51.692+01:00\">8.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>To be fair, I'd happily shove my face into any of the four puddings. They all look fine. Suprisingly.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d97eee4b0760efba2ad7e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:31:25.420+01:00\">8.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>They are also piping cream around the base and adding fruit for prettiness. &quot;Stop fiddling with Charlotte,&quot; says Mel. The challenge is over.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d97cce4b0bbc67cfff28f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:30:47.166+01:00\">8.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>As if all of this wasn't enough, they now have to glaze that sucker. Surely the addition of more fluid will lead to at least one collapse. Come on.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9795e4b0bbc67cfff28e\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:30:09.933+01:00\">8.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>It is the next day. The Charlotte Royales have been in the fridge overnight. &quot;She's not a looker,&quot; says Ruby rather sweetly about her effort. Frances almost crosses herself when she sees hers is OK. Beca and Kimberley eye each other up as they ease theirs out of the bowl.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d975be4b0bbc67cfff28d\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:29:10.341+01:00\">8.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>They are &quot;putting the mush in the brain and the lid on the brain and the brain in the fridge&quot;. Again, Sue saying what some of us were thinking. Ruby's looks less like a brain and more like a dropped blancmange.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9718e4b0010b6627a7c0\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:28:13.061+01:00\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Kimberley keeps holding her bowl to the light to check for gaps. Ruby is lobbing bloodied lumps of cake into an unlined bowl and sobbing bitterly as she does so. Come on, ladies and gentlemen, she really is as hopeless as she said. Give her a patronising round of applause.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d96c6e4b0010b6627a7bf\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:27:13.751+01:00\">8.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ruby's roll now looks revolting and quite anemic looking. Surely they won't have anything positive to say about it. Mel and Sue whisper about the contestants. They snicker about Kimberley's confidence when she heard the challenge was to be a Charlotte Royal. &quot;I was at school with her,&quot; mimicked Sue with arch brilliance. Love them, love them, love them.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9699e4b0bbc67cfff28a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:25:46.988+01:00\">8.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>And now the custard. It must be thick or the whole thing will collapse like a Tunnock's teacake with my thumb in it.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d965de4b0bbc67cfff289\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:25:08.261+01:00\">8.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ruby's roll is oozing jam in a horrible way.

It's fun trying to work out what they're saying. So, the challenge is to make a Charlotte Royale. It's something to do with a set fruit custard (which must set overnight) and a bav-ah-warr. Nope, no idea. Looking forward to it though.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d955ae4b0bbc67cfff282\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:20:11.689+01:00\">8.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>So in summary, Beca is doomed.

Paul and Mary gush but he doesn't like the paprika. The cauliflower scones are lovely (times three) and also magical. Were they made by pixies and not Frances at all? This is like the elves and the shoemaker. She's a fraud.</p> <p>&quot;I got a Hollywood handshake,&quot; gushes Frances.

Paul says her canapes are boring. He said they had to look all the same! Why are they being so horrid to her? Paul says there is too much Stilton in her cheesy bites. The Welsh rarebits have booze in. Paul says there is too much beer. They've basically crucified her.

Paul chides her for not filling her shells properly. After the love has gone, eh? Mary loves her pastry but wants more seasoning. They're picking fault this week but I suppose they have to. But her choux are flat. Not as &quot;lively&quot; as Paul would like.

I would like to go to this party. Kimberley's crab has a good texture, her sesame seed buns are too big for Paul's mouth and the overall concept is ingenious.

Is she OK? Things are being filled and piped and urged into tiny cases. The string quartet (Bond is it?) are plucking madly with a synth adding extra drama. I think they should play live in the tent to really drive the contestants mad.

Beca says that her fellow competitor is on planet Frances. She smiles but she spits the words out, her nose covered in flour which is clearly sticking to the sweat.

Choux pastry, meringe, puff, shortcrust. It makes me want to cry. I find it hard enough to cook one thing at a time. Kimberley is making her buns uniform by using a cake pops tray. She says this as though we all have one lying around.</p> <p>Sue is buzzing in the contestants ears, reminding them how awful it would be to go this week. This really is a bad time to get the push isn't it? There will be crying later. No question.

Someone got me some of those for my birthday from a posh cheese shop. But I didn't know they were cheese flavoured and nearly hurled a rainbow of fromage and meringe everywhere. After that I decided I quite liked them. It was just the shock.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d9206e4b0bbc67cfff277\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:07:15.702+01:00\">8.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Ruby's canapes incorporate beetroot jelly. &quot;You little tart shells,&quot; says Paul to Ruby as if he didn't know how that would sound in the edit. She is making her usual fist of chucking dry-looking pastry at a board and hoping for the best. Kimberley is making her fillings - chicken for some steamed Chinese buns and a bunch of other savory stuff that all sounds like something I'd eat a lot of at a party.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d91a6e4b0010b6627a7b2\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:05:35.823+01:00\">8.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The canapes must be the same size, says Paul. Pack a big punch in a small pastry case, he says as if the one who doesn't manage it will be punished with a taser. It's just canapes, dudes. Needless to say, Frances is making miniature works of art and she's wearing nautique! Breton stripes and red lips scream Paris to me. Well done, Frances.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-525d917de4b0bbc67cfff275\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-15T20:04:03.316+01:00\">8.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Frances is wearing a lot of red lipstick and Beca is rocking a pony/fringe combo which says &quot;I'm not here for a fashion parade.

I can spell canape! Sue tells us she has released a tiger into the tent. Perhaps with the new BBC One show next year, they'll have the budget for this.

You all got rather into the comments section too by the looks of things. It’s amazing how a little baking competition can so inflame the passions of a nation. </p> <p>It’s semi-final week and the remaining four competitors (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013pqnm/profiles/bakers\">Ruby, Kimberley, Frances and Beca</a>) must face their penultimate challenges with courage or “courage” as the French pronounce it, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013pqnm\">as they take on French patisserie</a>. Ah, the delicate art of drenching everything in butter, icing sugar and more butter.</p> <p>From this week’s press coverage we know that Ruby and Paul definitely don’t fancy each other, which is a relief. But the fact that half of the country were trying to match-make a 21-year-old stretched cherub and that middle-aged lothario in the first place is pretty upsetting. </p> <p>Anyway, get yourselves in the mood for le pain (and the pain) as those four women (who you can see posing on the cover of Radio Times this week) go head-to-head (to-head-to-head) in this, the very last Bake-Off semi-final to appear on BBC Two. Because the show is doing an Apprentice and moving to BBC One next series. See you here at 8pm!</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420011189|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|b08647acc2113d1ac90cb0b552f41e262d097374 -->",

        "body":"<p>It feels slightly odd that the BBC has announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/15/clangers-remake-bbc\" title=\"\">it is going to rework the 70s children's series The Clangers</a>, in a new \"technically improved\" version costing £5m. Anyone who has been anywhere near a cinema over the past decade knows that we live in an age of 70s and 80s remakes. And yet, looking at an old episode of The Clangers, it's pretty clear that it's everything that children's TV in the 21st century isn't. It proceeds at a stately, rather meditative pace: compared with most of what is on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/\" title=\"\">CBeebies</a> today, it feels like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/07/last-year-in-marienbad-review\" title=\"\">Last Year at Marienbad</a>. It's both cryptic and melancholy, as evidenced by the original descriptions of episodes that appeared in the Radio Times: \"The Cloud: There are no daffodils on the Clangers' planet, but it's not really as lonely as it looks.\"</p><p>In fact, from Vernon Elliot's soundtrack to the all-pervading atmosphere of isolation, it's a rather eerie programme. If it's nowhere near as nightmare-inducing as say, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWMjegykSSg\" title=\"\">Children of the Stones</a> or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKT6RR88SkY\" title=\"\">The Changes</a> – drama series that had clearly been conceived with the express intention of scaring anyone who saw them witless – it's definitely a product of the same era. But set against the melancholy was a kind of natural warmth, largely derived from the fact that The Clangers was what you might politely call charmingly rustic in appearance. It looked like it was made in a shed. Which, of course, it was.</p><p>It's hard to see how you can bridge the gulf between The Clangers and what children expect from TV in the 2013, and harder still to see how you can have The Clangers without its co-creator, the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/09/oliver-postgate-bagpuss\" title=\"\">Oliver Postgate</a>. The new version is being executive produced by his collaborator, Peter Firmin, and his son, Dan, who is also writing it. It's a hard heart that doesn't wish them all the best, but they don't have Postgate's narration, and, as Charlie Brooker once pointed out, Postgate's lulling voice was at the centre of his programmes' success: \"It was hypnotic, your conscious seemed to alter slightly the moment he started to speak.\"</p><p>A friend of mine who worked with Postgate towards the end of his life put it another way. Every time he rang him, he said, he heard the voice that narrated The Clangers and Ivor the Engine and Bagpuss. \"It's quite hard to have a conversation with him, because his voice is so powerful and evocative. It's like hearing God speak.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420035717|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|e980464c898a3cb375b2489f9abf9a844e2ee597 -->",

        "headline":"Masters of Sex recap: season one, episode two – Race to Space",
        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching the first series of Masters of Sex at UK broadcast pace. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode two – and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers.</em></p><p></p><p>One of the things I most enjoy about <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/masters-of-sex\" title=\"\">Masters of Sex</a> is the way it focuses on the women's stories as much as, if not more than, the men's. On the surface, Michelle Ashford, the show's writer, is telling the story of how Masters and Johnson came to carry out their study, but she uses that framework to address all manner of &quot;women's issues&quot;, from Johnson's growing problems with juggling work and children, to Betty's desire for a better life, and Libby Masters' belief that a child will stop her feeling like a failure as a woman. It's not that other dramas haven't addressed these issues, but Ashford is placing them centre stage. After two episodes I feel I know more about Johnson, Betty and Libby than I do about any of the male characters – and while that imbalance will need to be addressed soon if the men aren't to become ciphers, it makes a refreshing to change to watch a show in which women's concerns drive the plot rather than being relegated to the B-story.</p><p></p><h2>'It seems to me that any study that lands you in jail is not good for your career'<br /></h2><p>That said, we did learn a little more about the egotistical Dr Masters this week, namely that he is so convinced his study will change the world that he is unable to compromise in any way. He refuses Provost Shelby's olive branch and strikes a deal with the chief of police to stop any raids on the brothel he is conducting his study from. This lack of compromise and desire to dominate extends to his relationships with both Johnson and Libby – he continues to keep the former unsure as to whether she still has a long-term job while his attempts to control the latter's fertility treatment provided some of the episode's most painful and heartbreaking moments. I can't have been the only person to cringe as poor, brave Libby announced: &quot;I'm asking if you'd like to watch because if you do, you can watch me.&quot; Michael Sheen continues to impress as Masters, although there is a danger that so clinical a character might fail to attract any sympathy at all – certainly his cold dismissals of Johnson's job fears, Libby's fertility fears and Betty's baby desires hammered home the point that he's rather too fond of playing God. And yet, what makes Masters interesting are the odd moments of tenderness: he was kind to the prostitute who needed glasses, and his issues with Ethan and Johnson were understandable, given he believes their loose tongues have cost him the study.</p><p></p><h2>'I knew I'd feel a failure if I didn't have children and if I'm honest I knew they'd be the only thing I could truly love'</h2><p>Of all we learned about Johnson this week – she's definitely an accomplished liar who enjoys risks (see her sales pitch to the women in the brothel and the dismissal of the secretarial candidate) and she's actually as driven as Masters, but has the social graces to try and disguise it – the line about her children was probably the most revealing.</p><p>Last week Johnson told us that most women confused sexual desire with love. This week she admitted she knew she'd only ever truly loved her children. What's fascinating about this is that in a different kind of show we'd be given a terrible past or buried trauma to explain such &quot;transgressive&quot; behaviour. Instead we're asked to accept her as she is, without excuses being made.</p><p>There were also some fairly explicit parallels with prostitution drawn this week with Johnson imagining a variety of different answers to last week's proposal and at one point apparently coming close to saying yes in order to keep her job. Meanwhile prostitute Betty demonstrated that the only difference between her and Johnson is that's she prepared to openly state what she wants and use whatever leverage she can to take it. By the end of the episode Johnson appeared to be taking on board Betty's life lessons and preparing to use Masters' obsession with his study to her advantage.</p><p></p><h2>Notes and observations</h2><p></p><p>• Ethan's moment of sexual awakening with Johnson has clearly had a destabilising effect, leading the young doctor to spend the episode in a series of unsatisfactory encounters, all the while dreaming of Ginny. Who knew a well-delivered blow job could be so powerful? (Don't answer that question.)</p><p></p><p>• The scenes between the no-longer-anonymous orthopaedic surgeon, Austin Langham, and secretary Jane were well-handled, with the horny Langham seeing the study as a further chance for playing away and Jane having a superficially more earnest approach.</p><p></p><p>• Jane's consciousness-raising book of choice – Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex - was first published in 1949, although the American edition only came out in 1953. Her choice of reading matter coupled with her throwaway line to Austin (&quot;We'll always have Paris&quot;) suggested there's more depth to the outwardly fluffy Jane than initially suspected.</p><p></p><p>• Far from being a little woman content to let her husband make all the decisions, Libby has a sharp tongue and plenty of wit. The way she handed Masters' arrest was an intriguing mixture of disapproval, slight mockery and pragmatism. She also called him out on his excuses: &quot;Yes, you were characteristically vague&quot; and refused to back down over Ethan being reinstated as her doctor. She is clearly far more than the saintly, gullible wife of Masters' imagination.</p><p></p><p>• The show's use of Betty teeters between giving us a woman desperate to seize her chance at a new life and making her little more than an earthy dispenser of down-home wisdom. So far they've got it right but it's a fine line.</p><p></p><p>• If Ethan didn't tell the Provost about the couples' element of the study, then who did?</p><p></p><p>• Masters' imagining of Johnson's response to his proposal cleared up any doubt from last week – he may love science but he definitely finds her attractive.</p><p></p><h2>Quote of the week</h2><p></p><p>&quot;I was simply using the brothel as a working laboratory&quot; – probably my favourite excuse ever.</p><p></p><h2>Sexual advice of the week<br /></h2><p>&quot;My mother told me not to put something in my mouth if I didn't know where it had been&quot; – Ethan suffers a setback in his attempts to find another 'sexually adventurous' woman.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So what did you think – are you interested in how the show is shaping up, or did you expect it to be more about the study and less about the home lives? Can Johnson solve her work/home balance and will Masters give in and give her back her job on a permanent basis? Will Austin convinced Jane to participate in more &quot;science&quot; and is there any hope at all for Ethan? Let us know, as always, below.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420057423|2013-10-17T16:29:06Z|9434ae69a8a1e46ad77d1183374795af2d7881bd -->",
