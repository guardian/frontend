The figures show Hillary and Bill Clinton earned nearly $11m in 2015, and paid a total of 43.2% tax. “Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency as she releases her 2015 personal tax return and builds on the Clintons’ tradition of making their returns public since 1977 and Kaine releases 10 years of his returns,” campaign communications director Jenn Palmieri said in a statement. “In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and backtracking on his previous promises to release his tax returns,” Palmieri continued. “He has failed to provide the public with the most basic financial information disclosed by every major candidate in the last 40 years. What is he trying to hide?” Trump, Clinton’s Republican opponent, has steadfastly refused to release any of his personal tax information, citing legal advice from Trump Organization counsel not to publicly disclose his tax returns before the completion of an audit. In 2015, the Clintons paid an effective federal income tax rate of 34.2% on an adjusted gross income of $10,594,529. Adding an effective state and local income tax rate of 9.0%, the couple’s total tax rate was 43.2%. The Clintons donated $1,042,000, or 9.8% of their adjusted gross income, to charity. Kaine and Holton had an adjusted gross income of $313,441, and paid a total of 25.6% in tax. The Clinton campaign released a table showing the effective tax rates paid by Kaine and Holton since 2006, although they did not release one for the Clintons:\nPresidential candidates are not legally required to release their tax returns, although the practice has been the norm for more than four decades. Trump’s critics have speculated that the real estate tycoon is hiding his tax returns because they may reveal that he has vastly overstated his personal wealth, has unsavory business ties with the Russians or may be stingy with charitable donations, or some combination thereof. Trump’s tax rate itself has been posited as a possible reason for the campaign’s reticence - the New York Times today floated the possibility that Trump may pay zero federal income tax in some years. There are no laws prohibiting tax returns under audit from being released. Richard Nixon released his own taxes under audit in 1973, in part because of accusations of tax-dodging that eventually forced the disgraced former president to pay the IRS $476,431 in back taxes. When asked about his taxes at the time, Nixon willingly released the returns that had been under audit: “I welcome this kind of examination, because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook.

The meeting couldn’t come at a time of greater tension between Trump’s campaign and the Republican party. On Thursday evening, more than 70 Republicans published an open letter to RNC chair Reince Priebus calling on the RNC to redirect money pegged for the Trump campaign to be used instead for vulnerable congressional races – in effect abandoning the party’s presidential nominee. The signatories – including former New Hampshire senator Gordon Humphrey, former congressmen Mickey Edwards and Christopher Shays and numerous former RNC staff members – wrote that Trump’s “divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide, and only the immediate shift of all available RNC resources to vulnerable Senate and House races will prevent the GOP from drowning with a Trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck ... “This should not be a difficult decision, as Donald Trump’s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day,” the signatories state. Citing numerous controversies over the course of Trump’s candidacy, from the mockery of a reporter with a disability to his feud with the family of an army captain killed in action, the letter asserts that Trump has shown “dangerous authoritarian tendencies”. Should make for an interesting sitdown. Here’s what’s on the docket for today: Neither Hillary Clinton nor Tim Kaine have public events scheduled for today. Donald Trump will be holding a rally at Erie Insurance Arena in Erie, Pennsylvania, at 2pm ET, followed by a rally at the Blair County Convention Center in Altoona, Pennsylvania, at 6pm ET.","title":"Donald Trump to hold 'emergency' meeting with RNC","attributes":{"keyEvent":true,"title":"Donald Trump to hold 'emergency' meeting with RNC","pinned":false},"published":true,"createdDate":"2016-08-12T13:01:51Z","firstPublishedDate":"2016-08-12T13:20:50Z","publishedDate":"2016-08-12T14:12:11Z","lastModifiedDate":"2016-08-12T14:12:10Z","contributors":[],"createdBy":{"email":"scott.bixby@guardian.co.uk","firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Bixby"},"lastModifiedBy":{"email":"rashmee.kumar@guardian.co.uk","firstName":"Rashmee","lastName":"Kumar"},"elements":[{"type":"text","assets":[],"textTypeData":{"html":"<p>After nearly two weeks of a campaign in crisis, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign will reportedly sit down with Republican National Committee officials in Orlando, Florida, today for what <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-rnc-meeting-226938#ixzz4H65U1h2l\">one official told Politico</a> will be a “come-to-Jesus” meeting to discuss the state of Trump’s campaign.</p>"}},{"type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da/0_233_3500_2101/3500.jpg","typeData":{"aspectRatio":"5:3","width":3500,"height":2101}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg","typeData":{"aspectRatio":"5:3","width":3500,"height":2101,"isMaster":true}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da/0_233_3500_2101/2000.jpg","typeData":{"aspectRatio":"5:3","width":2000,"height":1200}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da/0_233_3500_2101/1000.jpg","typeData":{"aspectRatio":"5:3","width":1000,"height":600}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da/0_233_3500_2101/500.jpg","typeData":{"aspectRatio":"5:3","width":500,"height":300}},{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da/0_233_3500_2101/140.jpg","typeData":{"aspectRatio":"5:3","width":140,"height":84}}],"imageTypeData":{"caption":"Donald Trump","displayCredit":true,"credit":"Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters","source":"Reuters","photographer":"Eric Thayer","alt":"Donald Trump","mediaId":"811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/811e0632cdd209776ac6d2e0921227387beaf3da","suppliersReference":"ET436","imageType":"Photograph"}},{"type":"text","assets":[],"textTypeData":{"html":"<p>Although campaign staffers have dismissed the meeting as a low-key discussion about the campaign’s strategy in swing-state Florida, others involved in the planning of the Orlando meeting have told multiple outlets that the sitdown amounts to pulling the emergency brake on a candidate who has careened from one self-inflicted controversy to another.</p> \n<p>The meeting couldn’t come at a time of greater tension between Trump’s campaign and the Republican party.
