Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Dear Nicky Morgan</p> <p>In 2011, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-munich-security-conference\" title=\"\">prime minister said</a>: “Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream. We’ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong.”</p> <p>Though David Cameron used the word “state” in front of “multiculturalism”, his speech was widely reported as telling us that it was the bit about living our “different cultures” that had been a disaster. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12371994\" title=\"\">Laura Kuenssberg on the BBC website wrote</a>: “In frank language he made abundantly clear he believes multiculturalism has failed.”</p> <p>At the time, I didn’t hear anyone in government rushing to correct any ambiguity around what the prime minister actually said. The “vision” that teachers should “provide” has turned out to be the “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/09/michael-gove-british-values-curriculum\" title=\"\">basic British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance for those of different faiths and beliefs</a>”.</p> <p>I guess we’re supposed to lay to one side the fact that these owe plenty to universalist ideas originating in France, the US and the United Nations rather than to something specifically British. The message I get here is that in education, we don’t need to bother about being historically accurate. Or is talking about “values” in a universal way in itself dangerously multicultural?</p> <p>Cameron’s speech came early on in this government. Subsequently, we’ve been offered free schools. People like me have opposed these on the grounds that they get in the way of providing the same educational opportunities to all children and can lead to the absurd situation I heard played out on Radio 4’s Today programme in which a local authority is accused of not intervening in so-called problem schools over which it has no control – as has happened in Tower Hamlets recently. How handy for you that it wasn’t you being grilled by the interviewer. And yet, in your government’s rush to create schools controlled by your office, it’s your office that encourages “state multiculturalism”, which according to Cameron leads to us having “separate lives”, and can result in “Islamist extremism” and “terrorism”.</p> <p>I nipped over to the “<a href=\"http://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/what-are-free-schools/find-a-free-school\" title=\"\">Find a free school near you</a>” page at the New Schools Network site and found more than 30 schools which appear to provide a culturally specific faith ethos, whether that’s dubbed Islamic, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, Hindu, Christian, Church of England or Catholic.</p> <p>I fully concede that this is a guess – and people will correct me if I’m wrong – but I doubt if there are many Muslims in the Jewish schools on this list, nor let’s say, many Catholics in the Hindu schools, or Jews in the Hindu schools … and so on. Doesn’t that encourage people to lead “separate lives”? When people set up free schools with a faith name on the board outside, don’t they tend to give off a signal about who’s welcome to come inside? Why else set them up?</p> <p>I gather that these days, I’m what’s known as “ethnically Jewish”. I could set up an “ethnically Jewish” school, couldn’t I? I could agree to abide by all the conditions on your website; on the board outside my school I could write “The Michael Rosen Ethnically Jewish School”. If I set this up in north London, say, I can imagine that it might attract a few parents.</p> <p>And what would I have achieved? I would have pulled some children out of schools where they had mixed with children of many faiths, no faith, many cultures and mixed cultures. Ofsted would of course pop in to make sure I was teaching “British values” so I would take care to not call them “universal”. Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/11253436/Ofsted-rural-schools-failing-to-promote-British-values.html\" title=\"\">as Ofsted have instructed some rural schools recently</a>, I’d have to teach “diversity” even as we were practising the opposite.</p> <p>As I thought some more about my ethnically Jewish school, I wondered what kind of encouragement would the state give me, even though Cameron has warned me of the dangers of this? This time I nipped over to the government’s own website to see what kind of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/326402/201407v3_Single_FA_mainstream_published.pdf\" title=\"\">financial assistance</a> I might expect from your office.</p> <p>Here I learned that: “The secretary of state will pay grants towards recurrent expenditure and may pay grants towards capital expenditure” for my free school. Recurrent expenditure “means any money spent on the establishment, conduct, administration and maintenance” of my school, apart from the  capital expenditure which means expenditure on such things as: “acquiring land and buildings”; and “such other items … of a substantial or enduring nature which the secretary of state agrees are capital expenditure...” This may also include “funding for any other costs to the academy [or free school] which the secretary of state considers necessary”.</p> <p>That’s quite a lot of “encouragement”. Cameron should be told.</p> <p><strong>Yours, Michael Rosen</strong></p>","newspaperPageNumber":"42","wordcount":"822","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T07:09:08Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-11-28T12:17:11Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T07:09:08Z","internalComposerCode":"547867c7e4b0c45a9ee684fe","internalOctopusCode":"9818557","internalPageCode":"2200709","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:19:24Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/43yyk","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"18","internalShortId":"/p/43yyk"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"e45b98e75effaa0c934931b24bc4281d1207c243","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/28/1417177828331/Faith-schools-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Faith schools","caption":"'I could set up an \"ethnically Jewish\" school … And what would I have achieved?

Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>On the first day of Freshers’ Week, Lancaster University’s students’ union president got a message that police were photographing two posters in her office window. One said “Not for Shale”, the other: “End Israel’s attacks on Gaza”.</p> <p>“A union officer asked [the police] why the photos were being taken and was told that I was potentially committing a public order offence,” says Laura Clayson, 24.</p> <p>Public order offences relate to the use of violence or intimidation by either an individual or a group, so this could have been serious. The police officer in question later came to Clayson’s office and said he was taking pictures around campus to find out what students were feeling concerned about. “It was a completely ridiculous excuse,” she says.</p> <p>Clayson, who is also an environmental activist, was even more worried when the officer said he “knew of my ‘history’ … I felt like the whole incident was an intimidation tactic, reinforced by this reference to my past.”</p> <p>It’s the sort of incident, with overtones of surveillance and threat, that concerns both students and academics. And now the home secretary, Theresa May, has said that under the terms of the new counter-terrorism bill, universities must have “due regard … to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism”, or they could face court orders compelling them to do so.</p> <p>Many academics are worried that this bill is expecting too much of universities, and could clash with one of their guiding principles: to encourage the free expression and analysis of ideas, no matter how unpleasant.</p> <p>Dr Simon Mabon, director for politics and international relations at Lancaster, says: “A university is supposed to be a forum where people can develop critical tools that enable them to criticise the orthodoxy, and that can lead into some unpalatable areas. Then we would engage with them, in lectures and in seminars where students are challenged by other students and their tutors … I don’t think it’s the government’s place to tell universities what can and can’t be talked about.”</p> <p>May’s bill aims “to have a chilling effect – that is one of its objectives,” says Cardiff University’s Prof Michael Levi, a criminologist who has studied the financing of terrorism. “One of the things this will lead to is more intensive monitoring of societies within universities.”</p> <p>At Lancaster, Mabon recently organised a discussion about Isis at which, he says, invited experts felt they could not speak frankly in an open forum. They were worried that undercover police or officials might be in the audience. There was also concern that their words might be taken out of context and circulated more widely, putting them at risk. Clearly no one can learn about an urgent policy issue if those who understand it best are too scared to speak.</p> <p>Although the bill talks about “extremism” in general terms, Teesside University’s Prof Matthew Feldman – an expert on the far right who has advised government on measures to prevent radicalisation – has no doubt that it is really aimed at Muslim extremists, without anyone in government quite being willing to say so. Feldman acknowledges, though, that he is torn. “I don’t think Theresa May is lying when she says it’s a real threat. Islamic extremism is an issue. The question becomes: is this the best way of tackling it?” he says.</p> <p>“What is not clear to me is that the people who have been convicted of plots were radicalised at university. There is no convincing evidence of that at all. Do we have a large number of terrorists who’ve been to university? Yes. But that tells us more about terrorists – that they can be people who are intelligent – than it does about universities. There is no evidence that the problem is bigger at universities than it is on Hyde Park Corner.”</p> <p>There is, Feldman points out, no right to unfettered freedom of expression – but judging when to curb it is a delicate matter. And legislation is rarely delicate or subtle. “I might run around campus nude, and say it’s my right to express myself. But that’s not acceptable. If someone wants to take an immoderate position on Israel or Palestine, should I accept that the same restriction applies? Throwing bombs is obviously not acceptable, but trafficking ‘unacceptable’ ideas, what about that? They are just ideas.”</p> <p>According to Bath University’s Prof Bill Durodié, an expert in the causes and perceptions of security risk, the bill is based on the false assumption “that young people are vulnerable and susceptible to the power of suggestion”. He says: “We know that individuals who choose to affiliate themselves to al-Qaida or Isis are the opposite of vulnerable; they tend to be quite bolshy. There’s a kind of child protection approach that suggests what are, by the time they get to university, autonomous adults, are not autonomous adults at all. It’s infantilising.”</p> <p>From the Council for the Defence of British Universities, Howard Hotson, professor of early modern intellectual history at Oxford, argues that May’s bill is a logical extension of what he describes as the coalition’s redefinition of education’s core purpose – a paid-for service to acquire the skills necessary to advance the UK’s prosperity. “In this new environment, those fundamental intellectual disciplines most necessary for demolishing an extremist’s arguments – logical, rhetorical, and linguistic analysis; moral reasoning; the sifting of historical evidence – are now disparaged as virtually useless, and, more pointedly, not worth £27,000 plus living expenses to acquire,” he says.</p> <p>“If we now need to shield students from unorthodox ideas, is this not because we are now committed to educating knowledge workers, rather than informed citizens, who need to be defended by government-imposed censorship because they can no longer be expected to be able to defend themselves intellectually?”</p> <p>What exactly will universities do? Universities UK says it will be involved in the drafting of the accompanying statutory guidance, which will be subject to public consultation.</p> <p>Tom Slater, who co-ordinates the Down With Campus Censorship campaign for the political online magazine Spiked, says that universities already operate rigorous speaker screening policies. “It is already difficult for students to invite a speaker who is even possibly controversial.” Even the students’ own union, the NUS, he points out, denies a platform to speakers from certain proscribed organisations but also people that are not, including the feminist Julie Bindel and politician George Galloway.</p> <p>Durodié believes the government has its eye on the wrong target. Rather than crudely banning speakers, he suggests, it is more important to understand that radicalism does not happen suddenly. “The fact that those words and images may connect with an individual begs the question of why they may fall on such fertile soil to begin with. And that’s the bit that the government’s not engaging with,” he says. For politicians, it can be “too discomfiting” to accept that contemporary culture is a significant contributor to the problem of emerging extremist views. “It’s a social problem, not a security problem. But then you’re asking politicians to engage in a wider debate about society’s problems, and they’re not keen to do that. The political process has become about managing the British state, rather than shaping it.”</p> <p>May has also been accused of intellectual cowardice. “Does the Home Office really believe that our universities lack the capacity to defend civilised values in free and open debate?” Hotson asks. “And what will banning extremists from open public debate on campus achieve? Won’t they just congregate off campus, and propagate their doctrines secretly instead? If the extremist’s opinions are demonstrably odious and absurd, then what better way could there possibly be to expose them than the bright light of open, public debate? If such debate is to be banned from the university, then where in society can it possibly take place?”</p> <p>At Lancaster, Clayson is still baffled and disturbed at the police’s behaviour.

She was, she says “a bit anxious” about being interviewed for this article, in case there was backlash, perhaps from the police. “It’s scary being out there because you’re living what your politics are,” she says. “It’s hard to be that person who’s always speaking out.”</p> <p>With academics and campaigners concerned about existing restrictions on free speech, let alone, according to Feldman, “the danger of mission creep” if the new bill goes through, it may be that, in future, students are unwilling to speak out at all.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"41","wordcount":"1452","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-05T07:20:08Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-11-28T17:53:12Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-12-02T07:20:08Z","internalComposerCode":"5478b688e4b00d7876ba1b8e","internalOctopusCode":"9821473","internalPageCode":"2201026","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:19:23Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/43m6d","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"22","internalShortId":"/p/43m6d"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"2d1902b5818c9cecec18d0265a56344a2a304f52","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/28/1417197548607/laura-clayson-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"laura clayson","caption":"Laura Clayson, Lancaster's students' union president, with the posters that attracted police attention.

Photograph: Ableimages/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>It would be churlish of me not to give half a cheer for the latest idea from David Laws. The Liberal Democrat proposal to stop politicians making decisions on the curriculum and assessment is a paler version of a policy I have singularly failed to persuade my own party to adopt for the next general election.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the dividing line between politics and education is in the wrong place. In policy areas such as health, the equivalent of ministers telling teachers how to teach would not happen. To some extent, this is explained by their different approaches to evidence. Education doesn’t have the sort of shared evidence base that is available to medical staff – and politics fills the gap.</p> <p>However, things could be about to change. There is an increasingly powerful voice in education that is calling for a shift in culture from one where ideas seem to re-emerge with a different label every few years to one where we build on evidence of what has gone before.</p> <p>Seeds are being sown; the <a href=\"http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk\" title=\"\">Education Endowment Foundation</a> is spending millions of public money to invest in high-quality research; funding bodies such as the Wellcome Trust and Esmée Fairbairn, universities such as York and Durham, thinktanks such as Nesta are all looking at what might happen if evidence is placed centre stage.</p> <p>Most encouraging of all, teachers are beginning to drive the change. The rapid growth in organisations such as ResearchEd – a grassroots initiative that brings together teachers who want to improve the links with research – shows a thirst to find out what works in the classroom and share it with others.</p> <p>Laws’s idea tries to catch the edge of this revolution but I’m not convinced that he has the right focus or solution. He highlights the curriculum as being the area that should be free from political interference and while I couldn’t defend the constant meddling of recent years, it is a far more complicated than that. The knowledge and skills that children are taught are certainly not a matter just for politicians but neither are they a matter just for teachers, subject experts or universities. We all have a stake.</p> <p>Laws’s solution is to entrust the responsibility to an independent body. Part of the turmoil of recent years has been the constant shift of powers and responsibilities, from government to local authorities to schools to quangos and back again. I can see why an independent body is seen as the answer but the prospect hardly fills me with excitement. Education already has its share of such organisations – Ofqual, Ofsted and the funding agencies, for example, and I’m not convinced that they are seen as significantly different from government.</p> <p>I would focus the debate around where to place the boundary between education and politics on the issue of who decides how teachers should teach – after all, that is what makes the difference.</p> <p>Parties currently have policies on how reading should be taught, whether pupils should be set by ability and even whether teachers should adopt whole-class teaching. Soon, a school’s rating could depend on whether it complies.</p> <p>This is the debate from which politics should be excluded and where the line should be drawn. Pedagogy is becoming a case of opinion and prejudice rather than a decision based on evidence and professional judgment.</p> <p>Although it would be tempting to follow the usual path of giving responsibility for gathering and disseminating evidence to an independent body, we need to be more imaginative. Freedom from unnecessary interference is important, but the users – in this case teachers – need to be able to shape it to meet their needs. The gain might not only be a change in the relationship between politics and education, but for the first time teachers would have access to good quality evidence to inform their decisions. It might have the potential to be a big idea for both politics and education.</p> <p>Estelle Morris is chair of the executive board at the Institute of Effective Education, University of York</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"39","wordcount":"681","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-28T07:10:06Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-11-21T11:55:51Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-25T07:10:06Z","internalComposerCode":"546f2847e4b0770f491f744e","internalOctopusCode":"9785715","internalPageCode":"2196741","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:20:57Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/43g9y","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"22","internalShortId":"/p/43g9y"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"669122a631ce5278f0973914ce8a608c87351766","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/21/1416571865333/education-research-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"education research","caption":"'The knowledge and skills that children are taught are not a matter just for politicians … we all have a stake in it.'

Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>There’s a debacle going on in our schools that no one is talking about – especially not the government. That is wrong, because it will potentially mess up the lives of children turning 16 this academic year. So let’s talk about it.</p> <p>For the past 14 years, if you sat A-levels, your final grade was based on a number of exams taken at different points across your two years of study. If you did badly at one, you could resit. Beyond giving more opportunities for improving grades, this process had two other advantages. First, universities could see the grades so far achieved by a student when they applied for a place. And second, students could drop subjects at the halfway point while still receiving a formal (AS) qualification.</p> <p>From next September, however, the government has decreed that A-levels will return to being a two-year qualification. Exams will all be taken, just once, at the end of the two years’ study. The mid-point AS exams will be stripped out and offered as a standalone qualification.</p> <p>At first, this doesn’t sound too much of a debacle. Won’t sixth forms just offer the standalone AS levels first and then have students sit the full A-level in their second year? Well, no. Because, in its wisdom, the government asked exam boards to make sure the materials don’t easily overlap. Ministers want students to either do the AS or the A-level, but not both.</p> <p>So which do you take? No one knows. Cue debacle. Government sentiment is that the new A-levels are more “rigorous” and universities prefer them. Though given that almost all degree courses are modular, I expect “universities” is more likely to be ministerial shorthand for “my mates who are professors at a couple of Oxbridge colleges”.</p> <p>There were suggestions when the changes were announced that they would reduce the amount of teaching time that was being lost to exams and that they would relieve stress on students. This sudden concern for students’ stress levels seems disingenuous from a party intent on assessing four-year-olds and which had to be talked down from ranking children in their primary school exams. ​​</p> <p>B​esides, it’s not true. Without formal AS ​exams at the end of year 12, sixth forms will ​likely still run mock exams to ensure students are well-practised and can check their progress. As for stress, the one-shot nature of A-level exams​ will likely send student blood pressure skywards.</p> <p>Then there are the practical problems facing schools and colleges with the policy’s implementation. Funding to sixth forms has been cut; they will now receive funds only for three subjects per student. Given the lack of overlap between AS and A-level, it’s likely that only the brightest students would cope with sitting both. Solely offering three A-levels, and ditching AS levels ​entirely, seems the best option to many.</p> <p>This,​ though, comes at a price. Faced with “one shot” exams, students pick safer choices. “Try it for AS, and drop it if it’s too hard” is a common coaxing option in subjects such as maths and foreign languages, in which teenagers often have low confidence despite good skill levels.</p> <p>Cambridge University last week added a further twist when it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29914310\" title=\"\">wrote to schools</a> urging them not just to do A-levels but to enter students for the standalone AS. Its reasoning is sound: without AS grades students will be selected for university places based on less-recent GCSEs, or the notoriously unreliable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/22/half-a-level-grade-predictions-wrong\" title=\"\">predicted grades</a>.</p> <p>Even if schools and colleges can pick their way through the minefield and find a sensible way to deal with this for their students, it’s still likely that the summer of 2017 will culminate in problems. Students will sit all of their new exams at once; exam boards will have to mark them – all at once – and no one has the foggiest how grades will be affected by the newly introduced “rigour”. If it works as it should, grades ought to go down. What does this mean for university offers? No one knows, but a good guess is that students just returning from a gap year, with A-levels already under their belts, will be at a serious advantage over thousands of others now unexpectedly getting lower grades – who will be plunged into the chaotic clearing system to find a university place.</p> <p>The education secretary said in a speech this year that she didn’t believe the government had acted too fast. She wants to <a href=\"http://press.conservatives.com/post/98807929855/nicky-morgan-speech-to-conservative-party-conference\" title=\"\">plough on</a> with this “reform”.</p> <p>But with something this half-cooked it has to be worth delaying – even if just for a year. Exam boards still haven’t released their syllabuses, universities don’t know what they want, funding is tumultuous. The only reason for barrelling ahead is because there’s an election next year. But that is irrelevant if you’re a teenager making decisions about your entire future.</p> <p>We need to talk about this issue, and the government needs to fix it now. Sixteen-year-olds will only live this year once. Let’s not disrupt their futures for the sake of an election.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"43","wordcount":"851","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-21T07:10:03Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-11-13T17:23:03Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-18T07:10:03Z","internalComposerCode":"5464e8f7e4b0cb80d027b802","internalOctopusCode":"9758771","internalPageCode":"2192448","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:22:35Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/43acy","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"21","internalShortId":"/p/43acy"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"fd9a27608f874d6053dbac6d3a3e10ee8a84965d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/13/1415900067119/A-levels-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"A-levels","caption":"From next September A-levels will return to being a two-year qualification with exams taken at the end of the period.

Photograph: Jo Unruh/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>A strange thing happened recently. I turned on the radio and heard the education secretary speaking. It took a while to work out her identity; her voice was unfamiliar and she was talking about her subsidiary portfolio, women’s issues.</p> <p>The fact that she was unrecognisable was revealing. The policy of becalming the education world in the run-up to the general election is clearly working. It could be argued (and is self-evidently the view inside government) that a period of quiet contemplation, implementation and remoralisation is still necessary after all those relentless reforms and gimmicky initiatives.</p> <p>Although the latter can have a comical flip side. Whoever dreamed up Labour’s policy of a Hippocratic oath for teachers clearly hadn’t remembered the power of citizen journalists and social media to instantly disable ill-thought-through ideas.</p> <p>But Tory silence, or Labour’s “job done if we get on the six o’clock news” approach, isn’t good enough. Two weeks ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/28/cameron-admits-coalition-failures-on-education\" title=\"\">Estelle Morris</a> rightly wrote about the muddled thinking of the past four years. But dealing with the legacy of botched ideas is only half the story.</p> <p>It’s not that I miss Michael Gove’s foghorn communication with the outside world (although it did give us lots to write about), but he did at least have a narrative based on deeply held, if misguided, views. As the election nears, we need a different but equally passionate vision, not just for schools but for children and their place in society.</p> <p>Last week I gave a lecture at St Hilda’s college in Oxford, based on the historian RH Tawney’s suggestion that: “What a wise parent should wish for their children, the state should wish for all its children.” Re-reading much of the evidence about the multiple influences that determine whether children thrive personally as well as academically was instructive.</p> <p>What becomes blindingly obvious, and is hardly new, is that we must stop obsessing on school type, focus on the quality of teachers and heads and take a more holistic approach to children.</p> <p>Gove’s decision to remove the words “children” and “families” from the name of his department looks increasingly flawed.</p> <p>There is a 19-month gap in cognitive skills between children eligible for free school meals and those who are not when they start school. So rather than aspiring to recreate the characteristics of the secondary schools our pale, male politicians went to, we should be prioritising high-quality early years education and care, family support and parenting and parent education.</p> <p>Of course literacy, numeracy and robust qualifications matter, but so do character, creativity, resilience, self-esteem, perseverance and confidence. As England fixates on what can be measured and examined, talks down its teachers, and even more bizarrely argues about whether they should be qualified at all, our competitors around the world are investing relentlessly in their teaching workforce and exploring new ways of valuing personal, social and emotional development alongside academic work.</p> <p>In Singapore, a new curriculum for character and citizenship education has just been introduced. At its heart are core values of care, respect, resilience and harmony, leading to core competencies: self-awareness, management of relationships, responsible decision-making.</p> <p>And no, this is not coming from the lips of a wishy-washy progressive teacher spawned by Gove’s “blob”, but is an integral part of the national development of a country right at the top of those international league tables we aspire to emulate.</p> <p>Policy proposals about the content of the Ofsted framework, the battle of the middle tiers (commissioners versus local authorities versus independent directors), and (yawn) more competition only matter in relation to how they further these wider aims of good teaching, a broad curriculum and better support for children and their families.</p> <p>I would even suggest the creation of a minister with responsibility for children across government, to undertake the role Nicky Morgan appears to be rather blandly pursuing on behalf of women, and to stand up to wider social policies, like the housing benefit cap, which have led one <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/single-motheroffive-made-homeless-by-benefits-cap-turns-to-supreme-court-over-westminster-councils-attempts-at-social-cleansing-9824374.html\" title=\"\">mother to the supreme court, after she was forced to put her children into foster care so they could continue their education while she moved 55 miles away</a> to live in temporary accommodation.</p> <p>The government defends this particular horror on the grounds that it will make the country more prosperous and fair. Prosperous and fair are good, evocative words and they should be part of a bigger vision. But they will never be truly reflective of this country until we have proper polices for children that include but also go beyond schools.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"39","wordcount":"761","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-14T07:20:07Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-11-06T17:14:59Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-11-11T07:20:07Z","internalComposerCode":"545bac93e4b0fa3e4c06b8d0","internalOctopusCode":"9733495","internalPageCode":"2188618","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:24:03Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-11-11T00:00:00Z","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4355p","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"22","internalShortId":"/p/4355p"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-c6500866-fb04-4e4a-bd28-ba73bbb88e34","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/11/6/1415295185715/Early-years-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Early years","caption":"'We should be prioritising high-quality early years education and care, family support and parenting.'

Photograph: Neil Hall/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>Did anyone else notice that debate on schools policy was strangely absent from this year’s party conferences? Education received no more than a passing mention. It’s all a long way from the days when it was almost guaranteed a central spot in any leader’s speech. “Education, education, education” seems to have given way to “health, health, health”. Although the emphasis on the NHS is entirely understandable given the challenges it faces, I hope that the relative silence on schools isn’t a sign that the parties think all is well.</p> <p>The reality is very different. If proof were needed, it came in a recent speech from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/12/failing-schools-rescue-teams-squad-teachers-assist\" title=\"\">prime minister</a>. What masqueraded as an announcement of new ideas to get tough on “failing” schools if the Tories win the next election was nothing less than an admission that the policies at the very centre of the coalition’s education strategy since 2010 have failed.</p> <p>The speech outlined plans to extend the role of the newly appointed regional commissioners, giving them authority over all schools rather than just academies and free schools. They would become some of the most powerful individuals in education, with the ability to fire teachers and headteachers, replace governors, implement new approaches to behaviour and introduce new policies on uniform and homework.</p> <p>The speech could hardly be described as a logical next step for this government. The PM and his ministers speak now about local intervention, powerful regional structures and limiting headteachers’ autonomy but they are the same people who have been lecturing us for the past four and a half years about the dangers of local authority interference and the importance of freedom for all school leaders. This government told us that “choice” and the market would solve all our problems and redirected the efforts of a whole department of state to convert schools to academies that would be run from Whitehall.</p> <p>Ministers can point to an improvement in standards in some schools, which is of course to be celebrated, but the real test of a government’s strategy isn’t just what happens to already successful schools, but whether their policies work for those schools that most need to improve. It may be no coincidence that David Cameron’s speech came just days before Ofsted reported that the six Birmingham schools caught up in the “Trojan Horse” saga – five of them academies and the responsibility of the Department for Education – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/oct/14/trojan-horse-schools-done-little-fix-problems-ofsted\" title=\"\">had made insufficient progress</a>.</p> <p>It is difficult to exaggerate how much the botched changes of the last four years have distracted teachers from their real challenge of improving the quality of teaching and learning and although I’ve no doubt that regional commissioners will make good use of their powers, it would be a testament to their professionalism rather than the wisdom of the government. Ministers seem to completely fail to understand the problems they have created and seem incapable of offering any solutions.</p> <p>I offer four examples of their muddled thinking.</p> <p>First, if the Conservatives have at last realised that they can’t run a few thousand schools from Whitehall, even with an army of civil servants, why do they think eight commissioners will be able to support and challenge 24,000 schools spread across the length and breadth of the country?</p> <p>Second, when the education service is crying out for clarity about who oversees the growing number of academies and free schools, why does the government propose to exacerbate the problem by setting up a conflict between commissioners and local authorities over who oversees local authority schools?</p> <p>Third, if these policies are ostensibly about devolving power, why do they think that a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29574125\" title=\"\">National Teaching Service</a> of “superteachers”, rather than a local arrangement, is the answer to anything?</p> <p>Four, when the evidence shows the need for education to work closely with other agencies, why is there no attempt to reverse the fragmentation of services over which the coalition has presided?</p> <p>This government will leave a minefield of energy-sapping, unworkable policies for its successor. No matter how difficult the issues, let us hope that the lack of discussion at conferences merely hides a depth of thinking behind the scenes.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"41","wordcount":"698","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-31T07:19:05Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-10-24T10:14:14Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-28T07:19:05Z","internalComposerCode":"544a2676e4b039a8407f6674","internalOctopusCode":"9676871","internalPageCode":"2181297","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:27:05Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00Z","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/42m4y","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"24","internalShortId":"/p/42m4y"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-01cd5dca-c425-42db-94ec-10a20a8eb362","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/10/24/1414146109169/David-Cameron-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"David Cameron","caption":"David Cameron's speech outlined plans to extend the role of regional commissioners giving them authority over all schools.

There have been allegations that some headteachers have found out the date of inspections in advance. The watchdog has undertaken a new consultation on a draft “framework” – its inspection guidelines – including shorter, more frequent inspections and a toughening up of safeguarding issues, following some highly damaging failures. It also recently published a “myth-busting” guide to clarify its position on lesson-grading and the amount of marking expected.

Things have improved over time and schools have never been so good. I visit many across the country as a consultant and I’m blown away with the work schools are doing – yet the rhetoric from her majesty’s chief inspector is always negative. With what end? Teachers have had enough and very few want to be heads.</p> <p>Teachers are under intolerable pressure as heads, local authorities and academy sponsors panic about the next Ofsted and the next set of results. I feel very sorry for the many heads of schools in deprived areas whose results have fallen dramatically this year because of all the changes to exams. They fear this will trigger a no-notice inspection, and so it goes on. Teachers are no longer free to take risks in the classroom or be creative. Opportunities to take children out and see things are severely curtailed due to the need to move results up.</p> <p>Heads and teachers are frightened to speak out in case Ofsted are watching and might come in unexpectedly. My own staff often used to question my outspoken stance on the subject in case we all suffered as a result. But I think more heads need to stand up and be counted.</p> <h2>Jonathan Simons, head of education, Policy Exchange thinktank and founder of Greenwich free school, London </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7f85b6732ab76914cad71dae727358d45b7d9c88\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414151077254/a2c5f141-b57c-41b2-9365-cf3c34213e4f-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jonathan Simons.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Simons. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ofsted should be a hygiene inspector, not a food critic. By that I mean it should be headteachers who are the dominant actors: they should be the ones saying this is what we’re doing, these are the outcomes, here’s the data to prove it. Ofsted should be validating and challenging that judgment rather than making the judgment themselves.</p> <p>The move to end graded lesson observations is a good one, but I’d take it further. Whenever you have Ofsted inspectors sitting at the back of a lesson they are inevitably going to be judging that lesson in order to judge the quality of teaching overall. Ofsted’s scrutiny should be of the head and governors and the decisions they’re making, rather than just making their own drop-in judgments.</p> <h2>Vicky Peel, parent of three, Peckham</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"69837ee4540c8db25956b7775ae36e3ea8f06bff\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414151192627/2bf5777d-2557-44c8-aa9f-6b19df4441aa-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Vicky Peel\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vicky Peel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Ofsted came into my son’s school, I feel they had a very particular set of ideas about the place and found stuff accordingly. The school was placed in special measures, which was a very destructive process for everybody – including the children, who were furious that their school had been trashed. It wasn’t reflective of their experience as students, or mine as a parent.</p> <p>I would like Ofsted to come in and, if schools do need support, then I’d like them to offer some, but I don’t feel that happens. Instead, it’s like a damning judgment most of the time. The stress it puts teachers through is palpable.</p> <h2>Richard Pring, retired director of the department of educational studies at Oxford University</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"28b395578830feef6e6a7cd138772e7f3dbf4a74\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414151297398/a65697fc-ec1a-4df3-b32c-c5781d5e5baf-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Richard Pring.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Pring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gordon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the last few decades there has been a transformation of her majesty’s inspectors as a totally independent body to what is now Ofsted.

Nowadays, it seems like they’ve made the decision before they arrive based on exam data which actually isn’t reliable because you can just drill students on passing tests. It’s a garbage-in, garbage-out system. Ofsted needs to be looking at whether students are being challenged to think – and not drilled as robots to pass tests, which is happening in some schools. Ofsted may talk the talk but the reality is they actually encourage this kind of behaviour because they are too enthralled with their political masters who are in love with exam results.</p> <h2>Russell Hobby, general secretary of National Association of Headteachers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"14eac560971c5392703b256e9d4e68c8cf385e66\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414151464692/db570e93-2fbb-4037-b45b-8068bde8841a-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Russell Hobby.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russell Hobby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michael Wilshaw’s sincerity is glaringly obvious for everybody, but the very authoritarian strategy he used when he was a head doesn’t work when applied across a whole system. It creates an awful lot of anxiety and hostility, which eventually is going to undermine what he is trying to achieve. For schools, Ofsted feels like a trial where you’re defending yourself against an aggressive prosecution. You don’t learn from the experience.</p> <p>We think the first layer of inspection should be a peer review process, where schools come in and inspect each other. Ofsted should be moderating and quality assuring that peer review process and intervening where there’s a risk of failure. Ofsted, which is an industrial-scale enterprise, would be better if it did less and focused on areas of risk where it did high-quality inspections.</p> <h2>Jackie Schneider, primary school music teacher in south London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"be7c6a3d2660dc6ae0034bfcc371cb529fe7aae4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414151554507/0dd30ffa-b782-4661-9cb9-f3128999a4a9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jackie Schneider.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jackie Schneider.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amit Lennon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ofsted has completely mangled the English language: we had the word “satisfactory” which meant it was OK. Now, if you say it in a school, it means terrible. If you tell a teacher that they’re good, then they well up because what they hear is: it’s OK, but it’s not outstanding.</p> <p>The overwhelming feeling of most teachers is joy and relief at surviving and getting shot of Ofsted – people don’t walk around inspired afterwards. It’s not a driver for improvement. Ofsted has been really good at getting schools to be good at Ofsted, which is completely self-serving. There’s an entire industry of consultants selling advice on how to get in the outstanding category – I’d like to know how much schools are frittering away on this.</p> <h2>Beatrice Merrick, chief executive of the British Association for Early Childhood Education</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9146513acf9bb1aadd55c4aaa886ccc4813baad5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414159190453/ff0e9ca4-9f12-4d79-a6b7-592dd5ce9f84-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Beatrice Merrick\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beatrice Merrick</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new framework’s proposal not to inspect new early years settings for up to 30 months is a huge concern. The idea of two and a half years of children going through a setting that has had no inspection is really worrying. We are already anxious that there is a big backlog with early years inspections more generally: some haven’t been inspected for five or six years when they’re supposed to be inspected every four years.</p> <p>Of the inspections that have taken place, there have been a very high level of complaints about the quality of inspectors – in many cases this is thought to be caused by outsourcing. It is disappointing that while Ofsted is taking the rest of inspections back in-house, it’s not doing so for early years. This is for reasons we can understand – linked to the length of contracts and so on – but there’s a real concern that the quality of inspections is not good enough.</p> <h2>Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, the union representing senior personnel in Ofsted</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"df8078595b424293874ac992dc1c4d78d25ae1a6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414159256016/a6955125-32be-47ef-8f08-9e5df6f3e010-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Dave Penman\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dave Penman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Maisey/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ofsted is supposed to be independent of government yet, clearly, various voices and forces within government, will brief against what they’re doing or the people involved in it. That undermines the independence of the inspection regime – something which inspectors take very seriously – and damages its credibility among parents and teachers. School inspections have always been a political hot potato, with a lot of very strong ideological positions taken on all sides – but that creates a perfect storm around inspections. In the middle of it, all of the good work that inspectors do is lost.</p> <h2>Dr Michael Firth, headteacher of the Meridian school in Royston, Cambridgeshire, which won an appeal against Ofsted </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"29a811e9712c6811dbe29d4b12481f5a2cebf2dc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414159331490/0b394cf4-b8b5-4dd5-8928-2e8f12a9ad25-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Firth.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Firth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: stephen bond</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pretty much every term the framework is republished in some form, which makes it difficult for schools – and inspection teams – to keep up. Certainly the last inspection we had, the inspection team didn’t follow the framework and we weren’t given an accurate outcome [the inspection team said the school required improvement but the school appealed and won]. The inspection was part of the old system using private contractors, which thankfully is changing now that all inspections from next September will go in-house.</p> <p>At the moment, my school is awaiting inspection and the state of alert is a distraction. But the process suggested in the new framework is proportionate – you would have one day with two in-house inspectors, rather than a two-day inspection with a team of four people. The sad thing is that this change will only apply to schools that are good or outstanding.</p> <h2>Tim Brighouse, former chief commissioner for London schools</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"32a58c66cc4c6624934c1c6dc6d9c9cf63a9ac73\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414159402039/074d460e-eb7b-44bd-952d-317bfe5da8fa-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Brighouse.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Brighouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unlike some, I don’t believe Ofsted can be blamed for things going wrong in Birminghamschools – it isn’t the job of an inspector to spot extremism. The blame lies squarely with the secretary of state and the local authority. Ofsted was sucked into a task for which it was ill equipped.</p> <p>The body seems to have become confused as to what its role is and it appears too closely involved in policy to be credible.</p> <p>My view is that we need a regional school improvement system: I would have it democratically accountable to a board made up of representatives of local authorities in the area and professionals. If a region had cause to doubt a school or had concerns, you could then use a national Ofsted that otherwise would be keeping an eye on national standards and trends, and advising the secretary of state on policy.</p> <p>At the moment people are too micromanaged.

It has so much potential to go wrong. It’s so vague: are we going to be given a list of what British values are? I worry that it’s going to be a case of cutting and pasting a few things on to your website and that’s that box ticked.

People worry so much about Ofsted that the whole school system has become geared towards what they think inspectors might want.</p> <p>Whenever there seems to be a move in the right direction, for example stopping grading lessons, the emphasis moves to something else. Because there was a suggestion by Ofsted that progress would be measured by looking at books – schools suddenly switched their marking policies around. So now you’re getting primary school teachers who are expected to mark 90 books every night of the week, and secondary school teachers with 200-400 students who are now expected to mark those books in a week. The job of a teacher has become unsustainable unless you’re willing to put 70- or 80-hour weeks in.</p> <p>Headteachers have become like Premier League football managers and so they fear a poor set of results because it might lead to a poor report. Heads put downward pressure on staff, and staff put pressure on the children. The school is just working under a buckling system of stress as a result.</p> <h2>Geoff Barton, headteacher, King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b9fb58231479b34542570342176998c59bf7e35c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414159800861/127df9ce-ced5-4612-bdc5-9f3d64ae7f18-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Geoff Barton\" width=\"90\" height=\"135\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Geoff Barton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When inspecting teaching, one of the things that Ofsted has unhelpfully done is warp people’s views of what good practice is. If you talk about progress, people see it as a 20-minute slice of a lesson in which a teacher very artificially gets children to demonstrate that they know more at the end of the 20 minutes than they did at the beginning. Ofsted has become too formulaic.</p> <p>The reports feel as if they could have been phoned in from a desk somewhere else. The distinctiveness of a school isn’t noticed and things that count to parents – whether there is a school orchestra, a debating society, whether the uniform is smart – increasingly aren’t mentioned.</p> <h2>‘Disappointed Idealist’, a secondary school teacher and blogger</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"040218fa99f6e26a9b032bd32c4caf1b6844ea5d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414159870462/a9175786-540d-4b28-b736-252fe99a7caf-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"'Disappointed Idealist'\" width=\"126\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Disappointed Idealist’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Politicians have suddenly – in the run-up to an election – realised that the current teacher workload situation is unsustainable. But attempts to identify tasks to cut are doomed unless politicians recognise that a huge amount of unnecessary work originates with headteachers who feel under impossible pressures to deliver “WOW” (What Ofsted Wants). Until last year, the issue was that schools came to understand from inspections that lessons had to be delivered in a certain way. This drove teachers mad until Ofsted had to publicly issue guidance to its own inspectors. No sooner had that issue gone than the rumour went round that inspectors were demanding to see “dialogue with students” in marking. Suddenly, schools all over the country were demanding that teachers engage in what’s become known as “double-marking”, where the teacher marks the work, the student comments on the marking, the teacher then marks the student’s comment on the original marking and so on. It shows how fear of Ofsted is behind so much unnecessary work. The single biggest thing politicians could do would be to tell Ofsted to stop looking for specific inputs and instead focus on outcomes – letting teachers choose how best to teach while retaining accountability for results.</p> <h2>Sarah Chitson, a sixth form student in Oxfordshire</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b869f65c58e8cac674c7e7ab20fbbe45c9ca83c5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414159945152/81c41757-84b0-4a32-bfeb-42275ee1dcd3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Sarah Chitson\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Chitson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don’t think that Ofsted can tell what’s happening at the school if they are only there for a couple of days. I’ve seen teachers attempt to cram all of their different techniques into one lesson – the mini whiteboards, games and group activities/presentations – just because it’s the only lesson of theirs that Ofsted are going to see. They’re attempting to make one lesson representative of a few years’ worth of teaching, and I think that’s unfair on the teachers.</p> <h2>Andy Cole, principal of the College of North West London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"062926dc507b7df31e10a7e883098bdc85c7835d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/24/1414160001711/d9223f46-e59e-42d4-be23-3e6e83cfa144-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Andy Cole\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Cole</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a college point of view, the new framework is adopting some of the bad practices of old regimes and becoming very school-centric. Within the suggested framework they’re talking about getting rid of individual subject reports. In a large FE college, we do a diverse range of specialist training – from construction to training for the visually impaired in computing. At the moment we get a report on one department, it might be engineering, for example, talking about this subject in real depth, which is very useful for us.

Ofsted have moved outside their remit and started talking about methods. And, because Wilshaw is so outspoken, we’ve got ourselves into a situation where he’ll say: “Ofsted want to see this,” and then everybody starts doing it. It’s not true that schools just do things to please Ofsted, but they are becoming like puppets. Really, we should have a situation where the Department for Education says what works best for children and then Ofsted come in and regulate things like safeguarding. They’re tinkering with the framework but I’m not sure that they’re going to be able to turn it into something that will work – I think they might have to start over again. </p>","newspaperPageNumber":"40","wordcount":"2769","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-31T07:30:05Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-10-24T11:20:34Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-28T07:30:05Z","internalComposerCode":"544a3602e4b039a8407f6696","internalOctopusCode":"9667127","internalPageCode":"2181377","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:27:05Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/42m7k","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"150","internalShortId":"/p/42m7k"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-4020f727-137a-4f3a-9994-48f0dcba32e3","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/10/24/1414150355083/Michael-Wilshaw-head-of-O-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Michael Wilshaw, head of Ofsted","caption":"Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, was recently the subject of a leaked DfE memo showing politicians’ concerns over Ofsted.

Some courses rated outstanding by Ofsted – possibly including Cambridge University’s – are facing drastic cutbacks as ministers press ahead with controversial plans to hand control over training to schools. The move is causing serious unease even within the DfE, we understand.</p> <p>Providers are expected to be told the number of places they will have funding for. It is thought university-led provision will be scaled back and there will be a big rise in places routed through School Direct, the school-based training introduced by Michael Gove.</p> <p>Sources close to the DfE say there was a battle between Gove and his appointee Charlie Taylor, head of the National College for Teaching and Leadership, on one hand, and the Liberal Democrat schools minister, David Laws, on the other, with Laws wanting to avoid destabilising university-led provision. Despite Gove’s exit, Taylor seems to have won.</p> <p>Our source says: “There’s no debate in the DfE as to whether this is the rational thing to do. It’s simply ideological vandalism. No other country is doing this.”</p> <p>A DfE spokeswoman says: “The School Direct programme is in response to what schools want. Universities will continue to play an important role.”</p> <h2>‘British values’ take over school websites</h2> <p>You click on a <a href=\"http://nicolmereschool.co.uk/index.php/curriculum/british-values/\">school website</a>, sit back – or should you stand? – and the national anthem plays. It’s “British values” in action on school websites.</p> <p>One school, Rush Green primary in Romford, Essex, interestingly<a href=\"http://www.rushgreenprimary.org.uk/smsc/british-values-statement\"> includes discussion of local heroes Bobby Moore and Dame Vera Lynn in its coverage of the topic</a>. Bill Bolloten, an independent consultant, who pointed us to three such sites, says some heads responded very quickly after Gove’s statement in response to the Trojan Horse affair in June when <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/birmingham-schools-secretary-of-state-for-educations-statement\">he said he would put the “promotion of British values” at the heart of every school</a>.</p> <p>Bolloten tells us: “Schools do need to think about how they develop pupils’ social, moral, spiritual and cultural development. I worry that they are being blown off course by over-emphasising ‘British values’ – which are contested – because of political pressure.”</p> <p>No one from the school using the national anthem, Nicol Mere in Wigan, was available for comment about the webpage, which we understand was placed on the site this term.</p> <h2>More delays at Durand’s boarding school</h2> <p>A multi-million pound boarding academy in the South Downs has still not opened, weeks after term began for the south London children who will be educated there. Questions are being asked afresh about the Durand Boarding Academy, which was enthusiastically backed by Gove. Last month, when we learned it had not opened on-site in Stedham, West Sussex, we were told that this had always been planned and that pupils would be there later in the month.</p> <p>As of last week, they had still not arrived, with whispers that a half-term date was more likely. Why the delay?</p> <p>A spokesman says: “It has always been Durand’s intention for children to spend the first few weeks of term at our Stockwell [south London] site, before moving down to West Sussex.” And yet in an email on 5 September, the same spokesman had said the move would be “by the end of the month”. Now, though, there are still “a few final touches” to make.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one local encountered a bus carrying adults – possibly staff and parents – lost en route to the site last week. Sam St Clair-Ford says he had to give the driver directions, as the bus was heading the wrong way up a narrow lane through which it could not pass. We hope this is not a metaphor for the whole project.</p> <h2>The high price of forced academisation</h2> <p>When an interim board is parachuted into a school to turn it forcibly into an academy, how much do they earn?</p> <p>One consultant was paid nearly £20,000 over eight months, a Freedom of Information request has revealed. The unnamed member of the three-person interim executive board at Cavell primary in Norwich was paid £18,247.50, the local authority disclosed to a campaigner. Normally, school governors are not paid at all.</p> <p>Parent Rachel Ward, who campaigned against the academisation, said it was a “staggering waste of money”. Norfolk should have saved its cash by supporting the school’s existing governing body, she says. A spokesman for Norfolk council says the costs at this school “were higher than normal due to the complex nature of the school’s academisation process” and a judicial review. Also, the people needed “a particular skill set to oversee improvement”.</p> <h2>And the record for the smallest free school …</h2> <p>Finally, some free schools seem to be vying to have the smallest number of pupils. Last month we learned that Trinity academy, a secondary in Lambeth, south London, <a href=\"http://www.academiesweek.co.uk/secondary-opens-with-17-pupils/ \">opened with 17 on its books</a>. Meanwhile, not so far away in Morden, Park community school, a primary run by the Chapel St charity, which has links to the Salvation Army, emerged into the <a href=\"http://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/news/11506905.Controversial_charity_wins_right_to_open_secondary_school_in_Merton/?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed\">world with only 12 children, housed in a former Salvation Army hut</a>.</p> <p>But perhaps leading the pack so far is the Leeds Jewish free school, a secondary school which, <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/education/the-3m-leeds-school-with-just-21-pupils-1-6864311\">the Yorkshire Post reports</a>, has just 21 students despite now being in its second year. Value-for-money questions about the free schools project are unlikely to go away.</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"39","wordcount":"920","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-17T06:00:18Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2014-10-10T16:03:10Z","firstPublicationDate":"2014-10-14T06:00:18Z","internalComposerCode":"5438033ee4b08c06d131fae1","internalOctopusCode":"9627405","internalPageCode":"2173812","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-07-19T14:30:13Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2014-10-14T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The Guardian","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/42bzf","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","lang":"en","internalRevision":"44","internalShortId":"/p/42bzf"},"tags":[{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/education","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webTitle":"Education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/education"}],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-0e21ef33-d1f0-48b6-ba9d-cb44cd6cd59a","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/cartoons/2014/10/10/1412957943864/Teacher-training-011.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Teacher training","caption":"The DfE will announce its funding allocations for teacher training on Tuesday 14 October.

Photograph: Art Rickerby/Life/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>For much of the last 40 years, historians on both sides of the Atlantic have been trained to detach themselves from the supposedly distorting imperatives of “relevance”. They have addressed their work to other historians more than to the wider public. When they have reached out, it has rarely been to shape public policy. It is time to overcome that fastidiousness.</p> <p>History has played little role in policy-making for at least a generation. It made news when in 2012 the then foreign secretary, William Hague, raised the profile of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s in-house historians by moving them into the FCO’s main building on Whitehall. “They were languishing in a basement,” Hague said, “and now the light is shining on their books.”</p> <p>The FCO’s in-house staff of full-time historians proudly declare on their website that they “provide a long-term, policy-relevant perspective on international issues, and contribute to the collective knowledge and understanding of the FCO and British foreign policy”. Hague, no mean historian himself – the author of well-received biographies of Pitt the Younger and William Wilberforce – recognised their usefulness. “People enjoy history. They see the relevance of it. It informs our policies.” No other government department makes such systematic use of historians to form policy. And few professional historians seem to want to be enlisted into the policy process.</p> <p>More “evidence-based policymaking” has been a battle cry since the 1980s. Yet as the sociologist Pamela Cox argues, what counts as evidence has been quite narrowly defined: either “what works”, derived from the model of clinical trials of drugs, or “what is most cost-effective”, inspired by the audit culture of public services. There is little sense that the kinds of evidence used by historians can be a basis for policy: documentary records, archives or serial data, for instance. They might reveal what “worked” but not what is most cost-effective. When it comes to forming political or administrative decisions, the future still gets much more attention than the past.</p> <p>One benefit of historical perspective is learning that it wasn’t always that way. For centuries, even millennia, historians advised rulers, enlightened citizens and shaped policy. The really long view would go all the way back to Thucydides, drawing timeless lessons about human nature from the conflicts among fellow Greeks, or even as far as Cicero, for whom history was the “guide to life”.</p> <p>A medium-term view would light on the Regius Professorships of History in Cambridge and Oxford, founded in 1724 by George I to equip young gentlemen with the knowledge of “Modern History and … Modern Languages” they might need as diplomats, or on the late-Victorian holder of the Cambridge Regius chair, JR Seeley, who thought history was nothing less than a “school of statesmanship”.</p> <p>In the 20th century, historians shaped local government, steered the course of empires and advised presidents. The Fabian historians Beatrice and Sidney Webb spearheaded the London Programme, a plan for London’s future housing, transport and water needs, using expertise they gained co-authoring a multi-volume history of English government since the middle ages. Sidney Webb also served as secretary of state for the colonies and as secretary of state for the dominions in Ramsay Macdonald’s second Labour government.</p> <p>The mid-1960s were the high-water mark for historians in public policy. In the US, Harvard historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr became the court historian of John F Kennedy’s Camelot as a presidential adviser, and the radical historian of American foreign relations William Appleman Williams turned down the chance to steer Latin American policy for the Kennedy administration. (At least he was asked.) The last historian seconded to the White House was Eric F Goldman, a professor of American history from Princeton, who was a special adviser to Lyndon Johnson in 1963-66. In 1965, a historical section was added to Britain’s Treasury but its operations were wound up in 1976, “after its early advocates moved on and the relevance of its work to the ‘man at the desk’ became subject to concerted challenge”, as the historian of public policy Alix Green has observed.</p> <p>The near-universal retreat of historians from the formation of high-level policy is both a product and a cause of the endemic short-termism of our times. When the FCO historians describe their work as both “long-term” and “policy-relevant”, they state something of an oxymoron for policymakers. To be “policy-relevant” is almost by definition to focus on the short-term, as quarterly reporting, brief electoral cycles and planning horizons of at most five years determine almost all aspects of public life.</p> <p>Short-termism is an increasingly inadequate way to face up to contemporary national and global challenges. The hot new term for these problems is “megatrends”. Mathew Burrows, a former analyst for the US National Intelligence Council (holder of a PhD in history), has diagnosed various “megatrends that will undo the world” in his recent book, The Future, Declassified. These include struggles over natural resources, the ballooning global middle class, exploding healthcare costs for ageing populations and mounting threats to privacy and data protection.</p> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/commission\"> Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations</a> – an international panel of experts – identified a similar range of megatrends for coming decades in its 2013 report, Now for the Long Term. Their motto might be the line they quote from former French premier, Pierre Mendès France: <em>gouverner, c’est prévoir</em>: to govern is to foresee. Better advice would be Winston Churchill’s: “The longer you can look back, the further you can look forward.”</p> <p>Historians, taking a term from the great French practitioner of their craft Fernand Braudel, would call this the longue durée. The long view allows us to ask about the rise of long-term complexes over many decades, centuries or millennia and to distinguish what is temporary or contingent from what is enduring and cumulative among our current global discontents. It can also reveal alternative strategies from past societies. This can liberate us from the assumption that history can be reduced to path-dependency, as some economists might argue.</p> <p>The future need not run in the ruts of the past. It is possible to jump the tracks and take a new direction. Only by delving deep into the past can we hope to project ourselves imaginatively any meaningful distance into the future.</p> <p>A recent example of how taking the long view can transform public debate is Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Piketty has shown that standard analyses of the relationship between booming capitalism and declining inequality rested on short-run data collected in the historically anomalous decades after the second world war. His analysis of more than 200 years of data on western incomes reveals instead that inequality within societies is more likely to grow than contract and that it has been accelerating since the 1970s. This finding has profound implications for tax policy, social welfare and social cohesion more generally. But the pattern only emerged when the long-run trumped the short-term. Not for nothing has Piketty called his book “as much a work of history as of economics”.</p> <p>Debates on climate change also reflect the advantages and the limitations of historical perspective. On the one hand, Barack Obama’s former undersecretary for science in the US energy department, Steven Koonin, has recently argued for humility about future policy because we lack long-run data about the role of the oceans in climate change: “Precise, comprehensive observations of the oceans are available only for the past few decades.” On the other, historical economist Anil Markandya has shown that environmental regulation in 19th-century Britain did not have “any serious impact on GDP per capita”, overturning the orthodoxy that there is a necessary trade-off between growth and environmental protection. Meanwhile, French historians Sabine Barles and Gilles Billen have examined Paris’s “nitrogen footprint” to show how urban managers there invented sustainable practices for recycling waste in large cities: these are precedents relevant to practice and policy today.</p> <p>Historical thinking – and not just by those who call themselves historians – can and should inform practice and policy today. The Cambridge-based History &amp; Policy network has been notably successful at creating dialogue between historians and civil servants and at getting its evidence-based position papers on topics such as pension reform, women’s participation in politics and the governance of Northern Ireland into public discussion. Elsewhere, units staffed by trained historians investigate and adjudicate land claims by First Nations people in Canada and by Maoris in New Zealand, leading to radical revisions of the social contract in both countries. And in the recent debates on Scottish independence, the views of historians on the past and the prospects of the union carried unusual weight even if, as Scotland’s leading historian Sir Tom Devine quipped, “the future is not my period”.</p> <p>History should not be just affirmation, like Michael Gove’s myth of a single “national past”. Nor should it be entertainment: merely something “people enjoy”. It is a critical science for questioning short-term views, complicating simple stories about causes and consequences, and discovering roads not taken. History can upset the established consensus, expand narrow horizons and, in Simon Schama’s words, “keep the powerful awake at night”. In that mission lies the public future of the past.</p> <ul> <li>David Armitage is the Lloyd C Blankfein professor of history at Harvard University.
