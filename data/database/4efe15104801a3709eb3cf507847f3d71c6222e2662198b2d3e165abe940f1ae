But the velveteen breeches are spot on – or off.</p> <p><strong>Other characteristics?</strong> Laconic, contemptuous, doesn’t like pussies.</p> <p><strong>Come again? </strong>He doesn’t like pussies that kill his employer’s game.</p> <p><strong>Why’s that?</strong> Because he’s a gamekeeper.</p> <p><strong>Who’s his employer? </strong>Sir Clifford Chatterley.</p> <p><strong>Name rings a bell.</strong> Not much gets past you.</p> <p><strong>Chatterley has a wife I seem to recall.</strong> Constance.</p> <p><strong>And a war wound.</strong> Jolly nasty one.

Dirty novel by D H Lawrence.</strong> I think you mean masterpiece published in 1928 that captures the postwar nihilism of Britain, and man’s (and indeed woman’s) timeless search for the union of mind and body.</p> <p><strong>Not the kind of book “you would wish your wife or servants to read”. </strong>That, indeed, is how it was described by the prosecution at the 1960 Old Bailey trial at which Penguin was accused of obscenity. Penguin won the case and the book was published, complete with lots of four-letter words and uncomfortable alfresco sex.</p> <p><strong>Marvellous. But why bring it all up again? </strong>Because it’s now the kind of TV film you might not want your wife or servants to watch either.</p> <p><strong>Raunchy?</strong> A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark\">Poldark</a>-style bodice-ripper. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a> star Richard Madden may not look much like Lawrence’s description of Mellors, but he’s very dashing with his shirt off.</p> <p><strong>Super.

catch the others.</p> <p><strong>What’s next? </strong>An Inspector Calls.</p> <p><strong>Lots of sex?</strong> We live in hope.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with:</strong> <a

<p><strong>Do you realise how offensive you’re being here? I’m outraged. You wait until I tell Twitter about this.</strong> No, wait, stop. Denise looks like a pig because she is a pig. She’s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BetgJuD1NA\" title=\"\">Muppet</a>.</p> <p><strong>A Muppet? Like Miss Piggy? </strong>She is like Miss Piggy, but she definitely isn’t Miss Piggy. According to reports, Denise is Kermit the Frog’s new girlfriend.</p> <p><strong>Kermit and Miss Piggy broke up? But they were so good together.</strong> Are you kidding? They were awful. They were toxic and co-dependent, trapped in a joyless cycle of commitment-dodging and physical abuse. They were the worst couple in history.</p> <p><strong>Yes, but who is Denise exactly?</strong> All we know is that she is apparently a head of marketing at ABC – conveniently, the network that will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/13/tv-upfronts-abc-the-muppets-shonda-rhimes\" title=\"\">air the new Muppets TV show in the US later this month</a> – plus she’s a pig.</p> <p><strong>Wow, Kermit really has a type, doesn’t he?</strong> Only in that Denise and Miss Piggy are both pigs. They will be truly similar only if Denise suddenly becomes a dangerous egotist and starts beating up Kermit for kicks.</p> <p><strong>And how has Miss Piggy taken this news? </strong>Well, the actor Liam Hemsworth recently <a href=\"https://instagram.com/liamhemsworth/\" title=\"\">posted an Instagram shot</a> where he is gazing adoringly into her eyes, so maybe that says something.</p> <p><strong>He certainly seems like a step up from Kermit.</strong> Does he? What if they have children? Is the idea of a tiny, squealing, deformed pig-human hybrid really any less horrific than the idea of a tiny, squealing, deformed frog-pig hybrid?</p> <p><strong>I can’t say I’ve given it any thought.</strong> Well, do it. Give it some thought.</p> <p><strong>OK, I think a pig-man is probably slightly worse than a frog-pig.</strong> So what you’re saying is that you want Kermit and Miss Piggy to get back together?</p> <p><strong>I think so. </strong>You’re a terrible person. Also, you’re in luck because the Kermit-Piggy relationship will probably be central to the new Muppets show, or else ABC wouldn’t be busting a gut trying to sell a non-starter like Denise to us. Also, the Muppets are fictional and none of this matters.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Please welcome Denise to the Muppet family!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Huxtetter\" title=\"\">Mildred Huxtetter</a>?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10738400","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-09-03T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2364313","internalContentCode":"457850598","internalRevision":"28","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"In the new Muppets TV show, the gaze of the world’s favourite frog – and half of the most toxic relationship in showbiz – has been turned by another porcine beauty.

<p><strong>Age: </strong>36.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Games programmer and designer.</p> <p><strong>Nerdy, ubiquitous black hat?</strong> Exactly.</p> <p><strong>What does he do?</strong> He is – or perhaps was – a developer of computer games.</p> <p><strong>Was?</strong> He developed Minecraft, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/15/microsoft-buys-minecraft-creator-mojang-for-25bn\">sold it to Microsoft last year for $2.5bn (£1.6bn)</a>, and is now at a loose end.</p> <p><strong>How loose? </strong>Very, according to a series of bored tweets he posted over the weekend.</p> <p><strong>Such as? </strong>“Hanging out in ibiza with a bunch of friends and partying with famous people, able to do whatever I want, and I’ve never felt more isolated.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

<p><strong>I’m available.</strong> But you’re not a girl.</p> <p><strong>Nobody’s perfect. </strong>Hey, good line!</p> <p><strong>Are you going to fill this entire column with Mr Persson’s tweets?</strong> Yes. “When we sold the company, the biggest effort went into making sure the employees got taken care of, and they all hate me now.”</p> <p><strong>Why do they hate him?</strong> When they sold out to Microsoft, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c58e4b5c-1fda-11e5-ab0f-6bb9974f25d0.html\">Persson and his two partners trousered the dosh</a>; the company’s other 30-odd employees had no equity so couldn’t cash in.</p> <p><strong>And they resent him?</strong> He’s become a non-Persson.</p> <p><strong>I take it he’s Scandinavian?</strong> Very sharp of you. Born in Stockholm, Finnish mother, Swedish father, produced first game at the age of eight, released Minecraft in 2011.</p> <p><strong>A brief description of Minecraft for the uninitiated?</strong> Build your own virtual world before assorted monsters and zombies destroy you. Reckoned to be the best-selling game in the world.</p> <p><strong>How is he feeling now? </strong>He says he’s over his weekend blues and has apologised: “To people out there with real problems: I’m sorry the whining of a newly wealthy programmer gets more attention than yours. Stay strong.”</p> <p><strong>Good for him. </strong>But now he’s moaning about the media picking up on his tweets instead: “Journalism (noun): 1. Browsing twitter, speculating, and making up some shit. 2. (archaic) Accurately describing reality.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notch/statuses/638311608834465793\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Journalism /ˈdʒəːn(ə)lɪz(ə)m/    noun&#10;1.

<p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Ebullient once more!</p> <p><strong>Ebullient … So this will be Sarah, Duchess of York we’re talking about, not Sir Alex? </strong>Got it in one.</p> <p><strong>She’s still around? I’d almost forgotten about her. </strong>I know, right? But she’s had a busy summer.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Doing ghastly, vulgar things that are causing silent conniptions in private corners of Buck House? </strong>Absolutely! First she <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3189931/The-creditors-spitting-mad-Fergie-s-moving-tax-haven-Duchess-just-moved-13m-chalet-Switzerland.html\">moved into a £13m Swiss chalet that she bought with Prince Andrew</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, are they back together? Imagine the Queen’s face! Like she’s been sucking on a lemon corgi. </strong>No, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30759303\">both their names are on the deeds</a>, but she’s moved out of his house, the Royal Lodge, and is living there on her own.</p> <p><strong>What else? One Swiss chalet does not a busy summer make. </strong>She is thought to have acquired a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3215306/GIRL-TOWN-Fergie-s-new-1-000-guru-services-including-relaying-messages-dead.html\">new spiritual adviser</a>.</p> <p><strong>Tell me it’s Carole Caplin, and let us all experience not-quite-pop-cultural nirvana. </strong>Alas, no. It’s the US psychic Rebecca Rosen. But they are said to have been introduced by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/10/oprah-winfrey-sarah-ferguson\">Oprah Winfrey</a>, if that helps.</p> <p><strong>Brilliant! </strong>According to “pals”, Fergie is thought to ring her for positive life affirmations and help with major decisions.</p> <p><strong>Such as chalet purchases? </strong>One presumes. And maybe whether she should endorse small kitchen appliances for a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/30/how-low-can-fergie-go-the-duchess-of-york-is-sell-sell-sell.html\">QVC infomercial</a>.</p> <p><strong>That is a major concern? </strong>She <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/celebrity/article4323792.ece\">credits</a> Tristar’s Fusion Xcelerator food emulsifier with her recent 25kg (55lb) weight loss and highlights other Tristar products on her website under the heading “Duchess Discoveries”.</p> <p><strong>Ah, I can practically hear Prince Philip jackknifing in pain in a picture gallery somewhere. </strong>They include a set of hairstyling tongs.</p> <p><strong>He’s just fallen to the floor, fibrillating. I hope someone passes by soon. </strong>Last year it was suggested that she was going to launch a range of pudding-flavoured teas.</p> <p><strong>It’s a fabulously indiscriminate work ethic she’s got, isn’t it? </strong>Like an unremitting series of lunges after random lump sums.</p> <p><strong>No wonder she’s losing weight. </strong>And no wonder the Americans love her and the British aristos sneer.</p> <p><strong>Nicely played, Sarah F, nicely played. </strong>The duchess is her own greatest discovery.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> Tremendous!</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> This blender costs £60. Duchess, you are having a

</strong>Pensionable – the airline is 65 years old this year.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Ghastly, with most of its rather small roster of aircraft purchased from the Soviet Union after the end of the cold war.</p> <p><strong>Ooh, an aeroplane? Because I am thinking of going on holiday, as it happens.</strong> How lovely. Where to? The party island of Ibiza? The celebrated seafood trail of the Scottish lochs? The Maldives, while some of its islands are still above water?</p> <p><strong>No, I’ve decided to swim against the tide and head for North Korea. </strong>Right. That whole tense <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/26/north-korea-deal-diplomacy-on-peninsula\" title=\"\">entente-cordiale-of-sorts-with-neighbouring-South-Korea</a> thing not dissuading you, then?</p> <p><strong>No, if anything the ever-present threat of war with them, and, indeed, pretty much everyone else on the planet, adds to the frisson.</strong> And you are not put off by the fact that <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/04/130406-north-korea-kim-jung-un-counterfeit-gulag-world-facts/\" title=\"\">wearing jeans is illegal and you’re not allowed to talk to the locals</a>?</p> <p><strong>I will wear sensible slacks and maintain an air of unapproachable froideur. </strong>OK, well, if the need for comfortable trousers and lack of human interaction is not enough to put you off, maybe you ought to consider the fact that you’ll have to travel with Air Koryo, North Korea’s state airline.</p> <p><strong>Sounds lovely. Does Kim Jong-un do the flight-safety video?</strong> That might not make a whole heap of difference. Air Koryo has been named as the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/11823302/The-worlds-worst-airlines.html?frame=3072040\" title=\"\">worst airline on the planet for the fourth year running</a>. Indeed, it is the only airline on said planet to be given just one star by the <a href=\"http://www.airlinequality.com/ratings/a-z-airline-rating/\" title=\"\">Skytrax rating system</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oh. And that’s out of how many airlines? </strong>197.</p> <p><strong>Oh dear. Well – ha ha! - it can’t possibly be worse than … </strong>Ryanair? You couldn’t be more wrong. The much-maligned Irish chaps were one of 22 airlines to be awarded two stars, which means that Air Koryo is precisely half as good as Ryanair.</p> <p><strong>Blimey. And all because the planes are a bit long in the tooth? </strong>Nope, the Skytrax report also cites “questionable” safety and rudimentary safety belts, which is why pretty much all of Air Koryo’s planes are banned in the European Union because they’re a horrendous risk.</p> <p><strong>Ah well, Ibiza it is then.</strong></p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I seem to have left my boarding pass in my illegal jeans.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Hey, look! Asiana Airlines in South Korea got five stars from Skytrax! Go South Korea!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10716302","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-27T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2360537","internalContentCode":"457804256","internalRevision":"26","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The North Korean carrier has come bottom of an annual league table for world airlines for the fourth time.

Don’t tell me – hipster cafes were frying them in a light tempura batter and sprinkling them atop kale salads. Without them, the snack du jour is ruined.</strong> No. Much simpler. Not a modern tale, but one as old as time – the insects have attacked brassica crops, including cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage, as well as kale. Unless growing conditions remain perfect from hereon out, this will cause a superfood shortage.</p> <p><strong>How will all the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\" title=\"\"><strong>Gwyneth</strong></a><strong>-a-likes manage? </strong>It doesn’t bear thinking about.

You banish joy if you’re forever chewing on a fibrous bale of bitter greens.</strong> There are lots of ways to improve those aspects of this wonderfood.</p> <p><strong>Mm-hm. Any of them wholly successful? </strong>The Italian method of calling it cavolo nero and drowning small portions of it in cream, cheese, olive oil and spaghetti seems to work best.</p> <p><strong>I am almost persuaded.</strong> And in Sweden, they chop it up, fry it with cream, pepper and syrup. That’s called langkal.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Ah, Swedish for: “Let’s address this problem head on – ADD SUGAR!” I presume. </strong>But really, you should try my local cafe’s kale, oat and banana smoothie. It’s to die for, if it wasn’t going to make you live for ever.</p> <p><strong>You should try my local cafe’s egg, bacon and hash browns. You will die, but happy.</strong></p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I add kale to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/sorry-gwyneth-paltrow-but-steaming-your-vagina-is-a-bad-idea\" title=\"\">my morning vaginal steam</a>.

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Hipsterish, dressed in black T-shirts, usually found in California, though also increasingly visible in cities in India and China.</p> <p><strong>Pointy thing on the forehead, I seem to recall: </strong>Er, no, you are thinking of the mythical white horse that features in the literature of the ancient world. The modern unicorns – privately owned high-tech companies valued at $1bn or more – are resolutely modern.</p> <p><strong>So why are they called unicorns? </strong>Because when American venture capitalist <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/02/welcome-to-the-unicorn-club/\">Aileen Lee coined the term two years ago</a>, she could find only 39 in the US. Since she reckoned 60,000 software and internet companies had been “seeded” in the previous decade, that meant only 0.07 had grown into billion-dollar companies – hence they were as rare as unicorns.</p> <p><strong>And are they still? </strong>Apparently not. <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies\">At the last count, there were 131</a>, and they are growing by at least 50 a year. “Unicorns are becoming so common, maybe we should just call them horses,” is one Silicon Valley joke.</p> <p><strong>How droll. </strong>There is even a new terminology springing up to describe the market: “narwhals” are companies valued at more than $500m; “decacorns” are companies valued at more than $10bn. No one has yet come up with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber\">a word for Uber</a>, which is valued at more than $50bn.</p> <p><strong>Who cares? This is boring. </strong>True, but it matters because it could have the makings of another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/23/nasdaq-new-record-high-dotcom-bubble\">dotcom bubble</a>. “We may be nearing the end of a cycle where growth is valued more than profitability,” investment guru <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/634572713168793600\">Bill Gurley tweeted last week</a>. “It could be at an inflection point.”</p> <p><strong>An inflection point? </strong>I think it means everything is about to go belly-up.</p> <p><strong>Maybe the stock market collapse in China could be another indicator. </strong>I see you’ve been reading the FT after all.</p> <p><strong>What is this growth v profitability thing? </strong>Unicorns usually pursue market share rather than profit – for a digital startup, dominating your sector is everything. As a result, you can be valued at billions without ever making a cent. But eventually, investors might start fretting about the bottom line.</p> <p><strong>And then? </strong>Gurley reckons there are going to be lots of “dead unicorns” and “zombie unicorns” – and quite a few burnt investors.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with: </strong>The real world.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“It’s a dangerous spike.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Isn’t this a bit recherché for Pass notes? Perhaps we should have done Usain Bolt instead.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10710429","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-08-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2359315","internalContentCode":"457789817","internalRevision":"37","publication":"The

How much lower can we bow and scrape? </strong>Oh, c’mon – it’ll be fun! Storms called Brian! Hurricanes Ena and Betty! Terrible Downpour Elaine!

It’s still interactive and cool and everything!</p> <p><strong>Not as chosen, cool or interactive as coming up with something like Hurricane Bawbag, though.</strong> No, but … but …</p> <p><strong>Tell me, do you think this initiative has anything to do with the Met Office wanting to improve its standing in the popular mind since it </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/23/met-office-loses-bbc-weather-forecasting-contract\"><strong>lost its lucrative contract with the BBC</strong></a><strong>?</strong> No executive agency of the Ministry of Defence with such an honourable history, rooted in Britain’s proud naval traditions, could possibly be so needy.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Clouds are gathering. They look like a ‘Ptolemy’ to me.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Earlier on today, a woman rang and said she’d heard there was a hurricane on the way … Don’t worry, there isn’t!” Especially if you’re <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqs1YXfdtGE\">Michael Fish on 15 October 1987</a>.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10757349","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-09-09T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2367494","internalRevision":"95","internalContentCode":"457891423","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The lack of official names for bad British weather has been causing confusion, according to meteorologists, who have invited us to submit our own suggestions","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Thunderstorm Barry?

But the velveteen breeches are spot on – or off.</p> <p><strong>Other characteristics?</strong> Laconic, contemptuous, doesn’t like pussies.</p> <p><strong>Come again? </strong>He doesn’t like pussies that kill his employer’s game.</p> <p><strong>Why’s that?</strong> Because he’s a gamekeeper.</p> <p><strong>Who’s his employer? </strong>Sir Clifford Chatterley.</p> <p><strong>Name rings a bell.</strong> Not much gets past you.</p> <p><strong>Chatterley has a wife I seem to recall.</strong> Constance.</p> <p><strong>And a war wound.</strong> Jolly nasty one.

Dirty novel by D H Lawrence.</strong> I think you mean masterpiece published in 1928 that captures the postwar nihilism of Britain, and man’s (and indeed woman’s) timeless search for the union of mind and body.</p> <p><strong>Not the kind of book “you would wish your wife or servants to read”. </strong>That, indeed, is how it was described by the prosecution at the 1960 Old Bailey trial at which Penguin was accused of obscenity. Penguin won the case and the book was published, complete with lots of four-letter words and uncomfortable alfresco sex.</p> <p><strong>Marvellous. But why bring it all up again? </strong>Because it’s now the kind of TV film you might not want your wife or servants to watch either.</p> <p><strong>Raunchy?</strong> A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/poldark\">Poldark</a>-style bodice-ripper. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a> star Richard Madden may not look much like Lawrence’s description of Mellors, but he’s very dashing with his shirt off.</p> <p><strong>Super.
