And he viewed public service – in which he toiled for much of his career – as a rare privilege. He was a pragmatic problem solver who won the respect of collaborators and peers across the British film industry, and his was a highly credible voice that had particular value when articulated in favour of investment in risky projects, as it often was. He was a creative enabler who took his role seriously – while making himself the frequent target of his quiet, self-deprecating wit.</p> <p>Chris was born in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, to John and Gill Collins, respectively a building maintenance supervisor and secretary, and attended North Crawley Church of England primary school and Ousedale comprehensive. When I first met him in the summer of 1983, after he had just graduated in physics from King’s College London, his initial appeal to a starstruck teenager was that he was the coolest, smartest and most handsome man I’d ever met. I was not wholly surprised, catching up with him again a decade later, to find that he was now a budding film producer.</p> <p>He joined BFI Production (the film-making arm of the British Film Institute) in 1996 as a development and production executive, overseeing films including Carine Adler’s Under the Skin (1997) and John Maybury’s Love Is the Devil (1998). Striking out on his own, Chris served as line producer on Jasmin Dizdar’s Beautiful People (1999), associate producer on Pawel Pawlikowski’s Last Resort (2000), and producer of Francesca Joseph’s Tomorrow La Scala! (2002), Pawel Pawlikowski’s My Summer of Love (2004, featuring a then 21-year-old Emily Blunt) and Sarah Gavron’s Brick Lane (2007) – among many other credits.</p> <p>In 2007, Chris joined the UK Film Council – a body that had been set up by the Blair administration in 2000, absorbing the film-making responsibilities of the BFI. Serving first in the development team (which invested in screenplays), Chris then became senior production and development executive after a merging of the development and production arms into a new combined Film Fund. Films that Chris helped to steer include Andrea Arnold’s Wuthering Heights and Lasse Hallström’s Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (both 2011).</p> <p>The coalition government wound down the UK Film Council in 2011, with most of its functions returning to the British Film Institute. Chris continued in his role, helping to shepherd films including Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin (2013, no relation to the Adler title), Amma Asante’s Belle (2013) and Daniel Wolfe’s Catch Me Daddy (2014). Following his diagnosis of intestinal cancer at the very end of 2013, and serious illness in spring 2014, it was heartening to see Chris in Cannes in May, supporting Catch Me Daddy, and he was in Venice in August with Duane Hopkins’s Bypass. But the cancer returned.</p> <p>Pawlikowski said of Chris, “He loved cinema. He was inside it. He understood how the creative process worked. He would leave no stone unturned to create time and space for the director, if he sensed the film really needed it. In the face of disasters, he kept his sangfroid and wit. He was always the last man standing. He was not frightened of making unpopular decisions, not afraid of being disliked – though I never met anyone who disliked Chris. The respect seemed total and universal.”</p> <p>Chris is survived by his wife, Emma, and daughters, Jessica and Matilda.</p>","headline":"Chris Collins obituary","trailText":"<strong>Other

putting blanket bans on acts such as breath restriction or urination – context is always considered</p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>On 1 December, the Communications Act 2003 was amended. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/dec/02/pornography-law-bans-list-sexual-acts-uk-made-online-films\" title=\"\">The regulation of R18 pornographic content available on-demand in the UK </a>will henceforth be subject to the same standards as those applied to pornography on DVD by the British Board of Film Classification, where I am a senior examiner. The amendment applies to those works whose primary purpose is sexual arousal or stimulation, with the R18 category being a special and legally restricted classification primarily for explicit works of consenting sex, or strong fetish material involving adults.</p> <p>While some non-pornographic films may contain material which raises issues comparable with those which might be found in sex works, and which may also be subject to cuts – such as scenes of sexual violence – there is no direct crossover between the standards for sex works and those applied to non-pornographic films.</p> <p>Underpinning the BBFC guidelines is a specific requirement for the Video Recordings Act to have special regard to any harm that may be caused to potential viewers, or, through their behaviour, to society. This means that, before classifying a work, the BBFC may cut certain acts in pornographic works where imitation or the influencing of attitudes is a particular concern. Breath restriction is one such example. It would be wrong to assume that the BBFC consequently cuts all sight of people sitting across other people’s faces. But the BBFC will cut sight of clear and deliberate restriction of a person’s ability to breathe during sexual play. Breath restriction for the purposes of sexual enjoyment can result in death. Given such a clear and well-documented risk of harm, passing such breath play in a sex work would be contrary to the BBFC’s designated responsibility.</p> <p>The BBFC also intervenes where material risks prosecution under UK law. This includes prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Indeed, the BBFC’s designation under the Video Recordings Act requires that it does not pass any content in breach of UK law. We regularly consult both the Crown Prosecution Service and the Metropolitan police to understand and keep up to date with the types of content which are subject to prosecution and conviction. Consequently, we may not classify any material which may be subject to prosecution. Among other activities, this includes any repeated focus on urination during sex and urination over any other person, including any act which cannot be distinguished from urination on the basis of the onscreen evidence alone.</p> <p>It has recently been suggested that the introduction of the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations will lead to several acts now being banned from UK on-demand services, including spanking and verbal abuse. Much of this information is inaccurate, some of it is wrong. In judging material which may or may not be allowed under BBFC Guidelines, it is often unhelpful to speak hypothetically and in generalisations when specifics of context and potential harm in a given situation are among the considerations which really matter. The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations will ensure that UK on-demand content is consistent with legally available pornography off-line, benefiting from the application of UK law and the expert legal and medical advice which informs BBFC decisions.</p>","headline":"The truth about the porn law changes","trailText":"<strong>Murray Perkins:</strong> The film board isn’t interested in putting blanket bans on acts such as breath restriction or urination – context is always considered","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417621723759/Person-watching-porn-on-a-006.jpg","wordcount":"522","commentable":"true","byline":"Murray Perkins, senior examiner BBFC","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-06T16:00:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/03/porn-law-amendments-film-board","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/03/porn-law-amendments-film-board","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","webTitle":"Comment is free","type":"blog","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Comment is free","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/commentisfree","references":[]},{"id":"culture/pornography","webTitle":"Pornography","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/pornography","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/pornography","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"world/censorship","webTitle":"Censorship","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/censorship","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/censorship","references":[]},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/world","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/world","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/comment","webTitle":"Comment","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/comment","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/murray-perkins","webTitle":"Murray Perkins","r2ContributorId":"67367","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417623290560/Murray-Perkins-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"murray","lastName":"perkins","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Murray Perkins is senior examiner of the British Board of Film Classification, responsible for the 18 and R18 categories.

The Thanksgiving effect contributed to a firmer hold in the US. This dollop of The Hunger Games has been frontloaded more than previous ones – opening simultaneously in close to 90 territories rather than 40-something – so no surprise either that it is ahead of the last two at the second-weekend mark: $254.6m overseas against $146.1m. What is concerning is that many individual countries are tracking lower than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire\">Catching Fire</a> at the same point. Most rich countries grossed lower this weekend, and their overall second-week take also dropped; that’s even happening in some emerging markets, like Russia (Catching Fire, second weekend: $5.4m; Mockingjay: $2.5m). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/21/hunger-games-mockingjay-homesman-winter-sleep-get-on-up-video-film-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43g5t\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2196630\"                data-video-name=\"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, The Homesman, Winter Sleep and Get On Up: the Guardian film show – video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/21/1416561783266/Jennifer-Lawrence-in-The--014.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452346654\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/21/1416561781706/Jennifer-Lawrence-in-The--013.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames/141120TGFSHungerGames.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/21/141120TGFSHungerGames.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>It’s in less mature markets, like Mexico (Catching Fire: $4.3m; Mockingjay: $4.4m) and Brazil ($2.7m; $3.8m), where affection seems to be building. It’s probably too early – especially with $480.3m already banked, and given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/26/global-box-office-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-interstellar-dumb-and-dumber-to\">law of cleft final chapters</a> described last week – to declare a general cooling-off. But it’s interesting for anyone given to thinking about blockbusters in geopolitical terms that, to adopt Hunger Games parlance, heat for the franchise is now burning strongest outside <a href=\"http://thehungergames.wikia.com/wiki/The_Capitol\">the Capitol</a>.<br /></p> <h2>Laddie marmalade</h2> <p>There’s no doubt that StudioCanal’s fondly received <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paddington\">Paddington</a> adaptation has got off to a very fine start. Michael Bond’s diminutive bear has nipped between the legs of The Hunger Games for an $8m No 1 in his UK home market, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/dec/02/paddington-beats-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-1-at-uk-box-office\">the second best family-film debut in 2014 after The Lego Movie</a>. Paddington’s homeland, Peru, also got the film in its first week, where it did a tidy $405,000 – less than other kids’ fare there this year, like Mr Peabody and Sherman ($491,000), but higher than Interstellar ($369,000). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/28/paddington-concerning-violence-horrible-bosses-2-2001-a-space-odyssey-video-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43yhj\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2200600\"                data-video-name=\"Paddington, Concerning Violence, Horrible Bosses 2 and 2001: A Space Odyssey: Guardian film show – video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169977700/Paddington-Bear-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452743397\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169974735/Paddington-Bear-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington/141127TGFSPaddington.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Lacking a local tie-in, Paddington didn’t make as much of a splash in the much larger Mexican market, its other inaugural territory, taking little more than $1m. Translated into 30 languages and having sold 30m books, there’s no doubt that the dude in the duffle coat has worldwide appeal – which is why StudioCanal are releasing their film in 40 countries through to next February. Judging by the UK result and the superior quality, Paddington shouldn’t flinch from believing he can match the mighty worldwide grosses chalked by his predecessors in the mixed live-action/CGI kids’ bracket: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/24/the-smurfs-review\">The Smurfs</a> (2011, $563.7m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122289/alvin-and-the-chipmunks\">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a> (2007, $361.3m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/82594/stuart.little\">Stuart Little</a> (1999, $300.1m) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/10/yogi-bear-review\">Yogi Bear</a> (2010, $201m).<br /></p> <h2>Flightless birds</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5099a71adfa73c317cc4b0d35e062db5b86aca26\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/3/1417613938952/9d491c0f-8277-40c2-82e8-a31eabea7bae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Penguins of Madagascar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rudderless Skipper … Penguins of Madagascar’s disappointing returns could herald the end for the franchise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DreamWorks Animation/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picking up a penguin was not top priority for American audiences this weekend, with Dreamworks’ Madagascar spin-off debuting at a chilly $25.4m ($36m with Thanksgiving takings included) – despite sheltering under the franchise umbrella and being based on a popular Nickelodeon cartoon. That’s a low for the series, well below the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/106958/madagascar\">first film</a>’s $47.2m in 2005. Possibly it found itself squeezed between sharper-looking animation Big Hero 6, and the Hunger Games juggernaut, which swept off many of the adults who might otherwise have been attracted by the in-jokey overtures now standard for CGI cartoons (how many kids are going to get a <a href=\"http://youtu.be/BjfID263ViI?t=35s\">Werner Herzog shoutout</a>?). As emphasised in the trailers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/26/penguins-of-madagascar-review-benedict-cumberbatch\">Penguins of Madagascar</a> also follows the global-location itinerary (Venice, Shanghai, New York) demanded of big studio films these days. But it looks unlikely that its real-world passage will leave flames behind it. The early Chinese release ($30m+ and counting) bulks out a sparse-looking initial whip-round ($36.5m overseas this week in 45 territories, compared to Madagascar 3’s $77.2m from 25 in 2012). With plenty left on its rollout – including the UK this week, where Cumberbatch fever (he voices a covert-ops wolf) should win it fans – it should make good on a $132m outlay. But the Madagascar series could be running low on juice.<br /></p> <h2>Loss leaders</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/26/jennifer-aniston-horrible-bosses-2-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43j5p\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2198824\"                data-video-name=\"Jennifer Aniston on Horrible Bosses 2: 'I loved playing someone so twisted' – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933386241/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452595484\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933365269/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses/141125HorribleBosses.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>The Horrible Bosses franchise looks an even more conspicuous candidate for collecting its belongings and leaving the building after a shaky start for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/horrible-bosses-2\">the sequel</a>. A haul of $15.5m Stateside for director <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1890845/\">Sean Anders</a> (also co-writer on other current top 10 denizen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dumb-and-dumber-to\">Dumb and Dumber To</a>) is underwhelming, to put it mildly - nearly half of the first’s $28.3m in 2011. Taking $11.3m from 44 international locales is even more disappointing, with even the best results scraping into the medal places (Russia, $1.8m, No 3; UK, $2m, No 4; Germany, $1.1m, No 4; Mexico, $1.1m, No 3). The strange thing is that the second film is an improvement in some ways – more coherently plotted, and featuring snappy editing that shows off the souped-up budget (up $8m to $43m). So what’s gone wrong? I’d lay it at the door of Warners’ garbled marketing, which has failed to freshen up the hashtag immediacy of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142717/horrible-bosses\">original film</a>’s premise: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell playing “psycho”, “maneater” and “tool” respectively. New bosses Christoph Waltz and Chris Pine – the venture-capitalist father-and-son duo in charge of the torment this time – don’t register as succinctly in the sequel. That has trickled down into ineffectual posters and ads that fail to pull the same trick twice: convincing the perpetually online, zero-hours generation currently in their 20s that a comedy starring three men in their late 30s and early 40s is about them.</p> <h2>The rest of the world</h2> <p>After Johnnie To’s recent Don’t Go Breaking My Heart 2, yet another metropolitan love triangle landed high in the Chinese charts (and 7th worldwide) in the shape of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhgBKQnjkk8\">Women Who Flirt</a>, directed by Pang Ho-cheung, the Hong Kong veteran responsible for 2010’s lauded <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_a_Puff\">Love in a Puff</a>. As well as the $11.5m or so it took around Asia, it also enjoyed an $80,000 snifter in the US, despite reviews taking varying degrees of umbrage with its throwback frivolity.

That still lacks the crucial magic-potion ingredient compared to $20m-ish French debuts for the live-action (and big-budget) Asterix films of recent years. A return of $3.4m for the Korean action comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_To7w9_AUn4\">Big Match</a> was good for second spot there and 15th in the worldwide list. Lee Jung-jae stars as a mixed martial-arts star forced into a series of real-time hi-tech games in order to save his brother’s life. Who said Hollywood had a monopoly on daft high concepts? <br /></p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Penguins of Madagascar, Horrible Bosses 2 and Paddington all continue their rollouts next week – the last hoping to prove its mettle on a global stage in the key markets of France, Brazil, Germany and Japan. Ahead of its US opening on 12 December, Ridley Scott’s Moses epic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/exodus\">Exodus: Gods and Kings</a> stakes out safe theological ground with early engagements in Catholic countries including Mexico, Spain, Argentina and the Philippines, and also South Korea, whose Christian population is larger than its Buddhist one; Noah followed a similar pattern. Singham star Ajay Devgan leads the line on the $15.3m Indian action comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YubQzbzGHps\">Action Jackson</a>, one of Bollywood’s most expensive for 2014 (Shah Rukh Khan’s Happy New Year, at $21m, is reportedly the priciest). Adapted from the Telugu film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1756476/\">Dookudu</a>, having seemingly acquired some Kill Bill stylings on the way, Action Jackson is also getting the typical diaspora-oriented overseas release through Eros International. And December blockbuster season began in earnest in China on Tuesday, when the first part of John Woo’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmBfWxp1-z4\">The Crossing</a> pushed off the jetty. Based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_%28steamer%29\">the sinking of a Taiwan-bound steamer in 1949</a>, the $49m film has been dubbed the Chinese Titanic.

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/04/terminator-salvation-film-review\">Terminator Salvation</a>.<br /></p> <p>In <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/q-a-with-actor-christian-bale-1417449357\">an interview with the Wall Street Journal</a>, the British actor confirmed he had doubts about working with the Charlie’s Angels director prior to joining the cast of the fourth Terminator film, but was swayed by the film-maker’s enthusiasm. </p> <p>“He goes, ‘Give me a chance. Everyone needs to evolve, and I need to turn over a new leaf. And please, you must’ve been in this position before yourself, when someone has taken a leap of faith on you,’ – which I have – ‘please do that for me now; I promise you, I’m ready for it’.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcYdjHpJUV8\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcYdjHpJUV8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately for Bale – and McG – Terminator Salvation turned out to be the weakest instalment yet in the long-running sci-fi saga created by James Cameron. It received lukewarm reviews from critics and took just $371m <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=terminator.htm\">at the global box office</a>, down almost $150m from the series’ high water mark, 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Adjusted for inflation, Salvation would have taken around a third of its predecessor’s total.</p> <p>When asked if he was right to have given McG a chance, Bale replied: “There’s a lot of room for many approaches and many characters within the film industry. I won’t be working with him again, but I wish him very well. OK?”</p> <p>Bale also discussed berating a paparazzo in Italy who had insulted his wife, but said he was otherwise uninterested in the kind of campaigning currently conducted by George Clooney. “It’s boring, isn’t it? You know what I mean? It doesn’t matter that he talks about it,” he said. “It’s like, come on, guys, just shut up. Just get on with it and live your lives and stop whining about it. I prefer not to whine about it.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/17/profile-christian-bale-terminator-film\">• Profile: Christian Bale<br /></a><a

href=\"http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/2014/12/national-board-review-announces-2014-award-winners/\">named the best film of 2014 by the National Board of Review</a>.</p> <p>Each year the US organisation, whose best-of list is voted for by critics, film-makers and academics, casts one of the first stones in the annual awards season that culminates in the Oscars. Other early best-film prizes have gone to Boyhood, awarded by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/02/boyhood-bags-hat-trick-at-new-york-critics-circle-awards\">New York Film Critics Circle</a>, and Birdman, winner at the Gotham awards.</p> <p>Chandor’s film stars Oscar Isaac as Abel Morales, a New York businessman trying to build a heating oil empire, and coming up against violent rivals as well as law enforcement. Isaac shared the best actor award with Michael Keaton for his performance in Birdman, while Isaac’s co-star Jessica Chastain took the supporting actress award. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/07/a-most-violent-year-review-plucky-outsider-draws-blood-in-this-years-oscar-battle\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Xan Brooks described the film as “rigorous, resourceful and as smart as a whip. It surely can’t win [the best picture Oscar]; it’s too nuanced and sombre. But its canny tactical struggle remains a joy to behold.”</p> <p>Also appearing in A Most Violent Year is David Oyelowo, the British actor tipped for awards season recognition in civil rights drama Selma, which won a Freedom of Expression award.</p> <p>Other National Board of Review winners included Julianne Moore, who plays a woman suffering early onset Alzheimer’s in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/12/still-alice-alzheimers-julianne-moore-alec-baldwin-film\">Still Alice</a>, and Clint Eastwood, awarded best director for American Sniper. British actor Jack O’Connell won the Breakthrough performance award for his work in Starred Up and Unbroken.</p> <p>The Lego Movie won the best original screenplay award, suggesting it might break out of the animated movie ghetto this season, while Chris Rock was given the special Spotlight award for writing, directing and starring in Top Five.</p> <h2>Full list of winners</h2> <p><strong>Best

The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were sold by Professor Tolkien in the late 60s, the film rights,” Jackson said. “They are the only two works of his that have ever been sold … So without the co-operation of the Tolkien Estate, there can’t be any more films.”<br />While The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are by far Tolkien’s best-known fantasy works, the author also wrote numerous other stories about Middle-earth. The most famous is the posthumously published The Silmarillion, a collection of histories and tales written to flesh out Tolkien’s mythos prior to the time of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jul/29/hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-trailer-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4vbba\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2134090\"                data-video-name=\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies: watch the teaser trailer - video\"                data-video-provider=\"Warner Bros\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/29/1406649695456/The-Hobbit-The-Battle-of--017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-443296405\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/29/1406649679470/The-Hobbit-The-Battle-of--007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit/140729Hobbit.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/07/29/140729Hobbit_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>Ian McKellen, who plays the wizard Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, said at the premiere that he expected further films to be made in the future. Yet Tolkien’s son and literary executor Christopher is known to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-30283141\">extremely resistant</a> to the idea.</p> <p>“Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed by the absurdity of our time,” he told Le Monde in 2012. “The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialisation has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away.”</p> <p>Jackson may not have helped matters by splitting The Hobbit, a breezy children’s fable, into three epic movies complete with numerous new characters not imagined by Tolkien.

supervillain movie based on the DC Comics series, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/suicide-squad-cast-revealed-jared-leto-to-play-the-joker-will-smith-is-deadshot-1201368867/\">according to Variety</a>.</p> <p>Leto, in one of his first roles after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/03/oscars-broadcast-stopped-russia-jared-leto-ukraine\">winning the best supporting actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club</a>, becomes the first actor since The Dark Knight’s late Heath Ledger to play the Joker on the big screen. Smith, in a rare shift into ensemble fare, plays hired assassin Deadshot, while Hardy is military expert Rick Flag. </p> <p>Robbie has signed up to play Harley Quinn, another traditional enemy of Batman, while Delevingne will portray magical villain Enchantress. Jay Courtney, an Australian actor best known for his turns in Jack Reacher and Divergent, takes the role of dysfunctional villain Boomerang, traditionally an enemy of the Flash.</p> <p>Suicide Squad was revealed as part of Warner’s slate of 10 movies based around the DC Comics universe – an ambitious bid to take on Disney-owned Marvel Studio’s own hugely successful series of interlinked superhero films – in October. The original comic book, inspired by warsploitation fare such as The Dirty Dozen, is about a team of supervillains recruited to take on suicide black-ops missions in return for the commutation of their sentences. Fury’s David Ayer will direct the film version.</p> <p>“The Warner Bros roots are deep on this one,” said studio president Greg Silverman said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under David Ayer’s amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero.”</p> <p>There could yet be more star names joining the cast. Jesse Eisenberg – Lex Luthor in the upcoming superhero face-off Batman v Superman – is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/27/jesse-eisenbergs-lex-luthor-suicide-squad-superman-dawn-justice\">reported to be in talks to join the team</a>, while Warner is on the hunt for a high-profile signing to portray Amanda Waller. The latter is the Rick Fury of the series, the operative who chooses missions and sets out the Suicide Squad’s terms of engagement. Oprah Winfrey is reportedly the studio’s top choice, with Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer also said to be in the running.<br /></p>","headline":"Will Smith, Jared Leto and Tom Hardy sign up for

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks\">Paul Katis</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Entertainment grade: B+</strong></p> <p><strong>History grade: A</strong></p> <p>The 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment (known as 3 Para) of the British army originated in the second world war. The 3 Para Battle Group was deployed in Afghanistan in 2006.</p> <h2>Politics</h2> <p>The film begins on 5 September 2006 near the Kajaki dam in Helmand province. One of the men of 3 Para is addressing two Afghan boys who have just nearly killed him while indulging in the adorable childhood pastime of grenade-fishing. “I’m here trying to bring peace and love to your fucking stone-age country,” he explains. “Don’t pick a fight with an armed midget,” his buddy warns him. The unspoken question behind the film is set up: what are British soldiers doing in Afghanistan, anyway? Some critics have felt this film lacks engagement with the local population or the wider scope of the war, but surely that’s exactly the point: these soldiers are just ordinary blokes (they’re all blokes), a long way from home, doing an incredibly dangerous job without much sense of why.</p> <h2>History</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5vhurFXu5c\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5vhurFXu5c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/why-is-hollywoods-take-on-the-afghan-conflict-so-different-from-the-uks\">The film neatly underlines this</a> when the men return to Observation Post Normandy, a tiny camp at which members of 3 Para Mortar Platoon and 3 Para Support Company are bivouacked. One of the soldiers, armed with a Penguin classics edition, reads out a few lines of a poem: “When you’re wounded and left on Afghanistan’s plains/ And the women come out to cut up what remains/ Jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains/ An’ go to your Gawd like a soldier.” This is from <a href=\"http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_youngbrit.htm\">Rudyard Kipling’s The Young British Soldier</a>, published in his 1892 volume Barrack-Room Ballads. It is quoted in Patrick Bishop’s 3 Para, a gripping history of the battle group in Afghanistan. There and here, it makes an important point: that the most recent Afghanistan campaign has historical echoes in the Anglo-Afghan wars of the 19th century.</p> <h2>Legacy</h2> <p>The soldiers spot what appears to be an illegal Taliban checkpoint set up on the road below their observation post. It’s too far away for a sniper to take out the suspects, so they decide to go down to investigate. “This country’s full of shit left behind when armies fucked off,” says one. “Russians, it was the mines. Ten million fucking mines. God knows what we’re going to leave behind.” Good question.</p> <h2>Disaster</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ccb777bb169b488eae4b466d79c96b6ef79bd4c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417533149414/8c43246c-5ed4-4b61-803f-ff27eff3848d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kajaki - Andy Barlow (played by Liam Ainsworth)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Barlow (played by Liam Ainsworth)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three soldiers walk down a goat track towards the checkpoint. Then, all of a sudden, Lance-Corporal Stuart Hale (Benjamin O’Mahony) finds one of those Soviet mines. “I didn’t see a flash or feel a blast or heat,” the real Hale said later. “It was as if I’d stood on a banana skin.” The bottom half of his leg is gone. Medic Lance Corporal Paul “Tug” Hartley (Mark Stanley) hurries down with other soldiers. Though they take precautions in trying to reach Hale, there is soon another explosion and more are wounded. Corporal Stuart Pearson (Scott Kyle) has to deal with his own leg being blown off (everyone in 3 Para had basic medical training, as you might glean from the film). One of the men present, Private Jay Davis, said of Pearson’s reaction in real life: “He put the tourniquet on himself, put morphine into himself and we just had to leave him.” A Chinook helicopter arrives to save the men, but it can’t land because they are, of course, in a minefield – and it isn’t equipped with the winches it needs to hoist them up. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/17/chinook-inquest-military-afghanistan\">Unfortunately, this is accurate</a>. As the Chinook leaves, it whips up a dust cloud – and another mine is set off.</p> <h2>Humour</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa1c0e45c1a7dbab16f0f9d3653a6c5d3bdf0ef6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417537930543/bf89544b-4b07-40c2-85c9-8a35fcf0a55d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kajaki - film still Andy Barlow (played by Liam Ainsworth), Luke Mauro (Jon-Paul Bell), Dave Prosser (John Doughty), Jay Davis (Paul Luebke), Spud McMellon (Ali Cook), Mark Wright (David Elliot)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kajaki … Andy Barlow (Liam Ainsworth), Luke Mauro (Jon-Paul Bell), Dave Prosser (John Doughty), Jay Davis (Paul Luebke), Spud McMellon (Ali Cook), Mark Wright (David Elliot)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the fact that so many of them were seriously injured, Patrick Bishop’s account specifically says the men kept a sense of humour throughout their six-and-a-half-hour ordeal: “[Corporal Mark] Wright made brave jokes about the amount of insurance that would be coming to him.” The film’s strong screenplay, by Tom Williams, captures the tone of the soldiers’ dialogue authentically – tough, practical and witty, with any hint of sentimentality quickly cut down. “I’ll be legless every night now,” ruminates one of the wounded. Not only is this accurate; it’s also in a long British army tradition that you can see a century ago in the popular first world war commemoration volume <a href=\"http://www.firstworldwar.com/diaries/cockney_cricketonthesomme.htm\">500 Cockney War Stories</a>. In that book, one cricket-loving soldier is said to have reacted to having two comrades killed and his own leg blown off by reporting: “One over – two bowled – and I’m stumped.”</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>Kajaki is an unusual war film: rather than focusing on combat, it shows a foreign army dealing with the legacy of previous foreign armies in a much-invaded territory. It’s a fascinating and apposite take on the war in Afghanistan – and one which takes care to get its facts right.</p>","headline":"Kajaki – an impressive war movie with questions and ballistic grit","trailText":"A group of paras get stuck in a minefield in this historically accurate, mordant account of death and soldiering in Afghanistan in 2006, writes <strong>Alex von Tunzelmann</strong>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417529384968/Kajaki-film-still-004.jpg","wordcount":"837","commentable":"true","byline":"Alex von Tunzelmann","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-09T14:03:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/03/kajaki-reel-history-british-army-afghanistan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/dec/03/kajaki-reel-history-british-army-afghanistan","tags":[{"id":"film/series/reelhistory","webTitle":"Reel history","description":"The historian Alex von Tunzelmann watches classics of big screen history and prises fact from fiction","type":"series","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/series/reelhistory","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/series/reelhistory","references":[]},{"id":"film/kajaki","webTitle":"Kajaki","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kajaki","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/kajaki","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"film/war-films","webTitle":"War films","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/war-films","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/war-films","references":[]},{"id":"world/afghanistan","webTitle":"Afghanistan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/afghanistan","references":[]},{"id":"uk/british-army","webTitle":"British Army","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/british-army","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/british-army","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alexvontunzelmann","webTitle":"Alex von Tunzelmann","r2ContributorId":"25529","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/07/21/alex_vontunzelmann_140x140.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"vontunzelmann","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Alex von Tunzelmann is a historian and writer.

Original owner Fred Cook was once an understudy to opera legend Enrico Caruso, and oversaw things with his wife Grace (aka Lovey) until his death in 1947.

Raymond Chandler knew his way around the bar blindfolded, as did F Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner, back in the days when glamour, literary talent and heavyweight boozing were inseparable.

reviews dozens of films but hasn’t seen any of them. Tommy Edison, aka the Blind Film Critic, talks American Hustle, audio description and the joys of ‘watching’ his first silent movie</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>The next time you’re watching a big budget action movie – a superhero spectacle, perhaps, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jan/09/why-we-love-michael-bay-transformers\">or a Michael Bay-directed brain hemorrhage</a> – try this out. When a chaotic special effects-stuffed scene is just about to click into top gear, close your eyes. Keep them closed. And only open them only once the scene is over. Then ask yourself: what happened? Did all those audio effects tell a story or were they just a collection of thuds, screeches and explosions?</p> <p>The way sound and music convey information is an area of particular interest for film critic Tommy Edison. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyEdisonXP\">A star on YouTube</a>, where his videos regularly rack up more than a million views a piece, Edison has reviewed dozens of movies with his signature good-natured style: lots of humour, lots of self-deprecation and lots of fast-paced banter.</p> <p>But he hasn’t, in the strictest sense, watched any of them. Born with an undeveloped optic nerve, Edison has never been able to see. Endorsed by the legendary film reviewer Roger Ebert in 2011, and having chalked up appearances on countless US media outlets from CNN to the Howard Stern Show, Edison is known as the Blind Critic. </p> <p>His motto: “No spoilers. I don’t even know what happened.”</p> <p>The chatty American’s idea for his channel was borne out of frustration. As a film lover, he watched (for want of a better word) as film after film revealed its key plot moments using a visual language he has never been able to translate. A language that understandably left him hanging.</p> <p>“I thought it might be fun to review movies from a blind person’s perspective to show sighted people what that frustration is like,” says Edison. </p> <p>“Some people say: ‘How can you even review a movie? You can’t even see it.’” But a word to the wise, he says: “After 1928, they started putting dialogue in films. They’re not all silent any more! Before that, OK, yeah, I couldn’t review movies. But now I can and I love it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB-s7x26y88\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB-s7x26y88?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Edison’s favourite films may surprise. “I loved <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB-s7x26y88\">Hugo</a>. And you wouldn’t think so, because it’s this giant beautiful thing to look at. But that story just was cooking. I love <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCpePGwe08\">Goodfellas</a>. I mean, who doesn’t love Goodfellas? That’s a film I believe any sighted person could watch that without pictures, on a broken television, and be able to understand. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwZT9UBEJaE\">Clerks</a> was another one like that. I also really liked American Hustle. That movie won awards for costume design, which was completely lost on me!”</p> <p>Edison is currently in Australia as a guest of the <a href=\"http://otherfilmfestival.com/\">Other Film Festival</a> (Toff) at Melbourne Brain Centre. Billed as the world’s leading disability film festival, Toff programs a suite of films and events themed “to embrace the lived experience of disability”. </p> <p>A topic regularly discussed is audio description. Available in only a small number of cinemas and DVDs (provision is constantly lobbied for by the vision-impaired community), it’s essentially a voiceover track that narrates visual experiences so audiences without sight can understand them. The technology allowed Edison to experience his first silent film last year. “I got it. I knew what it was. That was huge for me,” he says. “Pardon the pun, but it was really eye-opening.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"119674ff0a5188e7c19b73499ef4e0553a25e7da\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417563070296/a4b6c69b-6fc0-4fc9-8582-c707fbfe4031-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"American Hustle's costumes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American Hustle’s costumes were ‘lost on me’, says Edison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois Duhamel/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2014, Toff will hold a competition to create the best audio description of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcyzubFvBsA\">FW Murnau’s 1922 horror classic Nosferatu</a> – and Edison is one of the judges. But when it comes to the films he reviews as the Blind Critic, having audio description – or even a friend telling him what’s happening – is against his rules.</p> <p>“It would sort of cloud my viewing or understanding of the film, because then it would be about their experience,” he says of the describer. “I can ask questions when it’s all over. But during it I don’t want to know. I’d rather try to figure it out by myself.”</p> <p>Edison’s candid and funny film reviews, and his persona as an affable pun-slinging chap who would never wish to be pitied, has led to another kind of fame. He now spends much of his time<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyEdisonXP\"> making videos</a> that address questions random commenters used to pose to him under the line on his YouTube reviews about living with blindness. Questions like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzah0A6IC5o&amp;list=PL775406A89C7B0AE9\">“how do blind people use the ATM?”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbiim4OaqDg&amp;list=TLxLIdPVzkejQ\">“can blind people open their eyes?”</a></p> <p>So for the record, yes, he dreams, but he cannot see in them (“my subconscious doesn’t know how”). Yes, he enjoys a tipple, though he doesn’t quite know what to make of “beer goggles”. Yes, he relies on his other senses, but doesn’t think his ability to use them is innately better than yours or mine. And no, he doesn’t understand what colours are. </p> <p>And on the subject of attraction and falling in love? “I do it backwards,” he says. “People look at a person in a bar or something like that and think: my god I’ve got to talk to them. Then after you get talking you learn what their mind is like. I do it the other way. I learn somebody’s mind first and then I learn what they look like afterwards.

The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/-sp-north-korea-hack-sony\" title=\"\">absurd move</a> was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/01/north-korea-sony-hacked-the-interview\" title=\"\">floated yesterday</a> when the notoriously paranoid nation was accused of hacking into the Sony Pictures computer system in pre-emptive retaliation for forthcoming comedy The Interview, which stars Rogen and James Franco as journalists who are granted a rare television interview with Kim Jong-un and then urged by the CIA to assassinate him.</p> <p>“To allow the production and distribution of such a film on the assassination of an incumbent head of a sovereign state should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war,” thundered North Korea’s UN ambassador in July. By which logic, we’d have been at war with Malaysia over Zoolander for over a decade now.</p> <p>This is merely the latest skirmish in an ongoing cinematic cold war, however. North Korea was fine with being branded part of Bush’s “Axis of Evil”, but mock them and they won’t see the funny side.</p> <p>They certainly weren’t laughing when Kim Jong-il was ridiculed as a pathetic, isolated dictator in Team America: World Police, singing his borderline-racist ballad I’m So Ronery around his empty palace. “Such behaviour is not part of our country’s political culture. Therefore, we want the film to be banned,’’ their diplomats complained.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3517ea12cfef27d44e533d7f58a2b41b851bf89\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417542166694/d636f3cc-7c81-4860-a665-0ff1262a453e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kim Jong-il was ridiculed as a pathetic, isolated dictator in the film Team America.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Jong-il was ridiculed as a pathetic, isolated dictator in the film Team America.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PARAMOUNT/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor were they amused when James Bond faced off against a North Korean baddie in Die Another Day, in a movie that depicted their glorious nation as technologically primitive and stereotypically torture-happy. “A dirty and cursed burlesque aimed to slander and insult the Korean nation” was <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&amp;dat=20030115&amp;id=mA0bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KUgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5004,1486209\" title=\"\">Pyongyang’s verdict</a>.</p> <p>The less North Korea finds it amusing, the funnier it gets – until they start a nuclear war, at least. They might have a point, mind you. In recent years, we’ve had North Koreans failing to invade the US in the Red Dawn remake (in the original it was Russians), North Koreans failing to hijack the White House in Olympus Has Fallen, and North Koreans abusing Angelina Jolie in Salt with their fiendish Oriental torture methods, just as they did back in the 1950s in movies including The Bamboo Prison or Prisoner Of War.</p> <p>Hollywood can hardly congratulate itself for taking a principled political stand here. North Korea is an easy target. There’s no export market there for a start, in glaring contrast to its equally undemocratic but immeasurably more powerful neighbour: China. Often, North Korea is merely a last-minute substitute. The Red Dawn remake actually started out with China as the invading force, but when Beijing started to grumble, they <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/16/entertainment/la-et-china-red-dawn-20110316\" title=\"\">hastily removed the Chinese flags and dialogue</a> and made the invaders North Korean instead. Cinema has had a fine tradition of ridiculing dictators and despots, from Charlie Chaplin to Sacha Baron Cohen, but what’s equally telling is the dictators they <em>don’t</em> ridicule. If there’s a sequel to The Interview, perhaps Seth Rogen can go and try to assassinate Xi Jinping. That’s how to start a proper war.</p>","headline":"Why do film-makers keep trolling North Korea?","trailText":"The country is fuming about the Seth Rogen movie The Interview – the latest film to wind up Kim Jong-un.

ursine hero draws in a family audience to nudge Hunger Games: Mockingjay off the top spot</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<h2>The winner</h2> <p>When StudioCanal jumped on board Paddington, after Warners opted not to proceed with a screenplay it had long developed, the company was taking a significant risk. Its biggest ever UK production had the potential to reach a large audience, especially in the UK, but it came with a hefty price tag, due to the cost of blending live action with a CGI character. And did children really know, and care about, Paddington bear, who owed his origins to Michael Bond’s stories dating back to 1958? A late switch of voice actor from Colin Firth to Ben Whishaw could be interpreted negatively as a problem that needed fixing.</p> <p>It’s doubtless with a mix of relief and jubilation that StudioCanal tallied initial box office receipts. An opening weekend of £5.13m is the second biggest debut for a family film this year, behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-lego-movie\">The Lego Movie</a>. (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/maleficent\">Maleficent</a>’s £6.59m opening frame includes £2.77m in previews.) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/frozen\">Frozen</a>, which proved the top draw for families last Christmas, began with £4.70m. Paddington has delivered the biggest opening weekend for a live-action family film since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131099/alice-in-wonderland\">Alice in Wonderland</a>, in March 2010 – unless you count the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/07/harry-potter-deathly-hallows-part-2-review\">final Harry Potter film</a>, which was a 12A certificate.</p> <p>StudioCanal’s previous biggest hit was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tinker-tailor-soldier-spy\">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>, taking £14.21m. It’s a dead certainty that Paddington will exceed that total, and the well-reviewed film, which enjoys a 7.9/10 user rating at IMDb, could go a lot further. StudioCanal also currently has The Imitation Game in play at £9.48m so far, and with a fair wind – including Bafta and Oscar nominations – the second world war codebreaking drama could reach Tinker Tailor levels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/28/paddington-concerning-violence-horrible-bosses-2-2001-a-space-odyssey-video-reviews\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43yhj\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2200600\"                data-video-name=\"Paddington, Concerning Violence, Horrible Bosses 2 and 2001: A Space Odyssey: Guardian film show – video reviews\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169977700/Paddington-Bear-010.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452743397\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/28/1417169974735/Paddington-Bear-008.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington/141127TGFSPaddington.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/28/141127TGFSPaddington_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Paddington, Concerning Violence, Horrible Bosses 2 and 2001: A Space Odyssey: Guardian film show</figcaption> </figure>  <p>In order to create a feature-length storyline for Paddington, writer-director Paul King (who shares the story credits with Hamish McColl), created an arc – and a villain – that are not to be found in the source material. Having successfully done so, Paddington is in great shape for further film adventures, with another freshly created storyline peppered with comic misadventures drawn from, or inspired by, Bond’s text. Discussions with the film’s producer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/24/david-heyman-film-power-100\">David Heyman</a> (Harry Potter franchise) are presumably already under way.</p> <p>The arrival of Paddington proved predictably detrimental to Nativity 3: Dude, Where’s My Donkey?!, which fell 49%. After three weekends of play, the festive sequel stands at £4.65m, which compares with £4.38m for predecessor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150688/nativity-2\">Danger in the Manger</a> after the same amount of play.

Lionsgate probably isn’t panicking. Eleven-day receipts of £21.25m compare very equivalently with £21.71m for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-hunger-games-catching-fire\">Catching Fire</a> at the same stage of its run, and the film has another whole week of relatively little competition until it gets clobbered on 12 December by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/01/the-hobbit-the-battle-of-the-five-armies-review-film-peter-jackson\">The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</a>.</p> <p>To beat Catching Fire, Mockingjay needs to reach £34.1m. To match The Lego Movie as the biggest film of the year so far, its target is £34.3m. Having dropped by 52% from its opening weekend, signs currently are that it will just fall short of those goals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/nov/26/jennifer-aniston-horrible-bosses-2-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/43j5p\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2198824\"                data-video-name=\"Jennifer Aniston on Horrible Bosses 2: 'I loved playing someone so twisted' – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933386241/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-452595484\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/11/25/1416933365269/Horrible-Bosses-2-Jennife-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses/141125HorribleBosses.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/11/25/141125HorribleBosses_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <h2>The comedy alternative</h2> <p>It’s been a while since there’s been a Hollywood comedy on release: the last one was the little-loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sex-tape\">Sex Tape</a>, in early September. Horrible Bosses 2 consequently had a clear run at adult audiences looking for comedy fare, and distributor Warners may be slightly disappointed with an opening weekend of £1.26m. The original <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142717/horrible-bosses\">Horrible Bosses</a> began with £2.08m in July 2011, eventually reaching £10.48m.</p> <p>With sequels, the audience tends to be more front-loaded, as fans of the original film rush out to see the follow-up. For that reason, you wouldn’t expect Horrible Bosses 2 to achieve a lifetime box-office that is five times its opening weekend, as the first one did. A final total around £5m looks more likely. The conclusion would seem to be that lots of people enjoyed the first Horrible Bosses film, but weren’t necessarily eagerly anticipating a second one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJo29XoIt94\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJo29XoIt94?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The plucky contender</h2> <p>Many films face the challenge of addressing both a core market and a broader audience: how do you fine-tune your marketing campaign so it effectively targets both groups? With Kajaki: The True Story – a virtual reconstruction of real-life events experienced by British soldiers in the Kajaki valley, Afghanistan, in 2006 – that challenge was particularly acute. Ideally, a film’s audiences are overlapping or adjacent. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/27/kajaki-the-true-story-review-afghan-war-film\">Kajaki</a> could be positioned as a well-reviewed, gritty true tale from a first-time director and a relatively unknown cast, targeted at upscale viewers willing to investigate challenging fare. Or it could be directed squarely at British soldiers, former soldiers, their family members and sympathetic friends – a market that his been ill-served by feature films unapologetically celebrating the courage of British forces in Middle East conflict zones. Those two audiences are far from overlapping or adjacent; in fact, they’re quite far apart.</p> <p>In the end, the producers of Kajaki, who are self-distributing the film, opted to focus principally on the latter with their marketing materials. The strategy made sense, given the decision had already been made to release the film with an exclusive two-week run at Vue cinemas nationwide. The tagline “For Queen. For country. For your mates” suggested engagement of an audience sympathetic to British soldiers, if not necessarily to the British military project in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The outcome – £55,000 from 81 cinemas – feels a little underwhelming, although it’s worth bearing in mind that only 34 venues played it for all showtimes, with the remainder offering one or two slots a day. Despite working with military charities, including Walking with the Wounded and Help for Heroes, Kajaki doesn’t seem to have energised its soldier/former-soldier base in sufficient numbers. Kajaki’s backers report that the film played particularly well in Vue West End, where it came second to Paddington, and also in Portsmouth, Edinburgh Omni and Basingstoke.</p> <p>Whether the film could more successfully engage its twin potential audiences with a mix of multiplex and arthouse venues is a question that may yet be answered. The exclusive Vue run ends on 11 December, which means other cinemas will then be able to book the title – if they have room on their screens to give it a punt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/mar/28/frozen-deleted-scene-disney-animation-video\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3zv8x\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2066932\"                data-video-name=\"Frozen: a deleted scene from the Oscar-winning Disney animation – video\"                data-video-provider=\"Disney\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/27/1395934354142/Still-image-from-Frozen-d-013.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-433145974\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/27/1395934351600/Still-image-from-Frozen-d-011.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/27/140331Frozen-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/27//140331Frozen.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/27/140331Frozen/140331Frozen.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/27/140331Frozen_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/27/140331Frozen_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Frozen: a deleted scene from the Oscar-winning Disney animation</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The reissues</h2> <p>Nearly a year after its release, Frozen is back in the chart for a festive reissue, adding another £178,000 at the weekend, and taking the tally so far to a spiffy £40.96m.

It’s worth noting, however, that this tally includes £141,000 in previews from 173 cinemas. Much of this was from the Hockney Live from LA event on 25 November, which presented the film together with a live Q&amp;A with subject David Hockney. With the documentary space increasingly cluttered in cinemas with a confusing array of choices, it is becoming ever more necessary to make an event of a documentary film’s release.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q75gwePUlh0\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q75gwePUlh0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <h2>The future</h2> <p>With the arrival of Paddington and continued success for Mockingjay, grosses are a welcome 32% up on the equivalent frame from 2013, when Catching Fire and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gravity\">Gravity</a> remained in the top positions, and animation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/free-birds\">Free Birds</a> was the best-performing new release.

Which is, broken down to its essence, also guide to how to do an uninspired big hit of 2014. You can almost hear the boxes being ticked in the boardroom as she raps ‘OMG’.</p> <p>1// <strong>A rebellious title</strong>. But not too rebellious. It’s Katy Perry’s This Is How We Do. It’s Run The World. It’s<em> Heal </em>The World. <br /></p> <p>2// <strong>Something supercute</strong>. It’s hard to know where to start with Spark The Fire but I guess we’ll go with the anime characters. Kawaii is the new everything.</p> <p>3// <strong>An unusual beat</strong>. You can’t just have any old beat these days. It needs to sound like rocking chairs creaking, or be carefully crafted from goat screams. Luckily, Pharrell has opted for a beat that sounds like spoons on saucepan lids.

I think there’s a massive nod to a certain make of car and a certain make of computer in there but I just can’t be sure. Anyway, the computer makes pizza so it can’t be real.</p> <p>8// <strong>FEMINISM</strong>. Do not even think about releasing a modern pop song without a girl-power lyric in there.

It can get Scarlett Johansson to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyFOfty5pmg\">sound like a bag lady at the back of the bus</a>. And it can make Brad Pitt read poetry that’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fR_v4HQEGo\">100% worse than what you wrote for GCSE English</a>.</p> <p>So here’s Chanel’s latest weirdfest, in which Pharrell and Cara Delevingne fart about on an empty dancefloor after being ‘reincarnated’ from a bell boy and a waitress into 19th century finery. Technically, you can’t be reincarnated if you’re still alive. But hey, fashion just bends the rules like that. The ‘song’ is probably the most annoying thing we’ve ever heard from Pharrell. More annoying than “bae” or that sexist song he did with that guy no one likes anymore.

even Gigi, there was a jolly musical revue in London called Petite Sauce Tartare that helped propel a young Audrey Hepburn into the limelight – a show in a nightclub that is now part of the National Portrait Gallery (NPG).</p> <p>“It is a wonderful coincidence,” said Helen Trompeteler, associate curator of photographs at the gallery, which announced details on Tuesday of a major exhibition exploring the life and career of one of the century’s biggest film stars. “It is very special to us that she appeared in our building so early in her career.”</p>  <figure class=\"element

include intimate and rarely-seen photographs from the Hepburn family, as well as classic portraits by some of the century’s leading photographers such as Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton, Irving Penn and Norman Parkinson.</p> <p>The exhibition will also explore her close collaborations with the Paris couturier Hubert de Givenchy. His most famous muse, Hepburn once remarked: “His are the only clothes in which I am myself.”</p> <p>She became one of the world’s most photographed women and what is striking is how in control Hepburn was of her image. “She had a very clear idea of how she wanted to be portrayed and in terms of how her image was used,” said Trompeteler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5608db947a20607e72d132b3e6652e2d9664dc02\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417538955966/03d1dcfb-c9d9-417a-aa49-cc59c4b66fe3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hepburn’s relationship with photographers such as Beaton was 'very much her guiding, rather than her being a passive recipient', says the show's curator.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hepburn in 1954.

I think she was a very modern star in having that awareness.”</p> <p>Born in Brussels in 1929, Hepburn arrived in London in 1948 to take up a ballet scholarship at the Rambert Ballet School in Notting Hill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f85cd0fb34492ebc03e6aa7734b97b7493c765a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417539281293/93d6f25d-8e4e-4d04-b117-bb081f184090-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'The world's most elegant actress': one of the magazine covers to feature in the exhibition.\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The world’s most elegant actress’: one of the magazine covers to feature in the exhibition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jours de France/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her appearances at Ciro’s on Orange Street, then the place to be seen and now the NPG’s public archive and study room, quickly got her noticed by talent scouts and photographers such as <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp70549/antony-beauchamp\">Antony Beauchamp</a>.</p> <p>These London years, far less well known than her Hollywood years, will be explored in the NPG show. Trompeteler said Hepburn “comes across as a very modest young woman really ... she clearly had great potential and talent but in the published interviews of the time she was modest.”</p> <p>The exhibition will include the young Hepburn in fashion photographs taken by Beauchamp and pictures taken by Angus McBean in 1950 featuring her as the face of Crookes Lacto-Calamine skin cream (“Your skin is not for burning”).</p> <p>After being spotted in Ciro’s, Hepburn began getting small parts in British films – she was a cigarette girl in Laughter in Paradise and a hotel receptionist in One Wild Oat in 1951.</p> <p>That was also the year she landed the breakthrough role of Gigi on Broadway and the NPG show includes photographs by Larry Fried showing Hepburn backstage in her dressing room.</p> <p>There will be some rarely seen photographs including a behind-the-scenes series taken by Mark Shaw during the making of the film Sabrina in 1953.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e90fff05172940af9603d66ab0680fc3e2413f68\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417539900089/b1582e82-41a9-4722-baff-535a2c818c59-407x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Hepburn captured in Rome in 1960.\" width=\"407\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hepburn captured in Rome in 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cecil Beaton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other confirmed loans will include Hepburn captured on set in Italy during the filming of War and Peace (1955), by Philippe Halsman and George Daniell; publicity photographs for Funny Face (1957) and on-set photographs taken by Terry O’Neill during the making of How to Steal a Million (1966) and Two for the Road (1967).</p> <p>The gallery will also have original film posters, magazine spreads and front covers including one from Life magazine in 1961 of Hepburn in Givenchy for her role in Breakfast at Tiffany’s.</p> <p>The show will take visitors through her later philanthropic life, serving as a Unicef ambassador from 1988 until her death in 1993. In 1992 Hepburn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States’ highest civilian award, in recognition of her contribution to the arts and her humanitarian work.</p> <p>Trompeteler, who will co-curate the show with Terence Pepper, the gallery’s senior special adviser on photographs, said they had wanted to put on an Audrey Hepburn show for some time.</p> <p>“She has always been a subject we’ve been fascinated by and she has appeared in a few of our previous exhibitions but there’s never really been one exhibition entirely devoted to her iconography. It has been a long time coming.”</p> <p><em>• Audrey Hepburn: Portraits of an Icon will be at the National Portrait Gallery from 2 July-18 October</em></p>","headline":"Audrey Hepburn back at scene of

Pyongyang, but secretive state appears happy to stay on list of suspects","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>North Korea has refused to deny it was behind a cyber-attack a week ago that resulted in online leaks of several new Sony Pictures films, possibly in retaliation for a forthcoming Sony film depicting a fictional plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un.</p> <p>The attack leaked at least five high-profile titles – the recently released Fury, as well as unreleased movies such as Still Alice, Annie and To Write Love on Her Arms – to file-sharing sites, and crippled the firm’s corporate email and other parts of its internal network.</p> <p>It also appeared to leak the salaries and other confidential information of more than 6,000 employees, leaving the studio facing accusations of gender pay disparities among top executives. Sixteen of the 17 most highly paid executives are reportedly male.</p> <p>The Interview, a comedy due for release next month about two journalists who are hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim, was not leaked. There has been speculation that the North, perhaps using hackers based in China, was trying to get its retaliation in early.</p> <p>Despite reports that North Korea has assembled a sophisticated cyber-attack unit, and similarities between the Sony hack and a cyber-attack on South Korean banks and TV networks last year, experts say little hard evidence exists to point to the secretive state.</p> <p>But North Korean officials appeared happy to let their country stay on the list of suspects. Asked whether Pyongyang was involved in the attack, a spokesman for North Korea’s mission to the UN accused “hostile forces” – usually a reference to the US, South Korea and Japan – of blaming everything on the North. But he added: “I kindly advise you to just wait and see.”</p> <p>The FBI said it was investigating the hack and did not name any suspects.</p> <p>Pyongyang reacted angrily when the Kim film’s plot became public this summer, and promised a “resolute and merciless” response unless the US banned it. North Korea’s ambassador to the UN, Ja Song-nam, called the movie “the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war”, in a letter to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p>Re/code, a technology news website, <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/11/28/sony-pictures-investigates-north-korea-link-in-hack-attack/\" title=\"\">was the first to float the North Korea theory last Friday</a>. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, it said: “Sony Pictures Entertainment is exploring the possibility that hackers working on behalf of North Korea, possibly operating out of China, may be behind a devastating attack that brought the studio’s network to a screeching halt earlier this week … the sources stress that a link to North Korea hasn’t been confirmed, but has not been ruled out, either.”</p> <p>Last week employees at Sony Pictures were greeted with an image of a red skull on their computer screens and the message “Hacked by #GOP” – thought to stand for Guardians of Peace. The screens then went dark.</p> <p>After a week of using only pens, faxes and telephones employees returned to a semblance of normality on Monday when some computer systems were restored.</p> <p>However the company faced embarrassment when Kevin Roose, a blogger for the news site Fusion, posted what appeared to be sensitive internal documents. An anonymous emailer sent him a link to a public Pastebin file containing 26 large archives, <a href=\"http://fusion.net/story/30850/more-from-the-sony-pictures-hack-budgets-layoffs-hr-scripts-and-3800-social-security-numbers/\" title=\"\">yielding an “insane” amount of information</a>, said Roose.</p> <p>One spreadsheet detailed employees names, job titles, home addresses, bonus plans, and current salaries. Of 17 Sony Pictures executives earning more than $1m only one, co-chair Amy Pascal, was female.</p> <p>Hannah Minghella, the co-president of production at Sony’s separate Columbia Pictures division, was on track to earn $1.6m in 2014 but that was significantly less than the $2.4m for her co-president, Michael De Luca, who in theory has equal responsibilities.</p> <p>The leak also included the script for an in-house Sony Pictures recruitment video and performance reviews for hundreds employees.</p> <p>The company did not respond on Tuesday to Guardian requests to verify the information.</p> <p>In a statement earlier this week it said it was trying to establish who was behind the attack. “The company has restored a number of important services to ensure ongoing business continuity and is working closely with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter,” it said.</p> <p>It is not the first time North Korea has been accused of mounting cyber-attacks. While most ordinary North Koreans have no access to computers or the internet, the regime is thought to have committed vast resources to the development of a cyberwarfare unit.</p> <p>Last year North Korean hackers were blamed for paralysing computer networks at three South Korean banks and the country’s two biggest TV networks. Some observers have noted that the methods used in that attack were similar to those used against Sony.</p> <p>But Martyn Williams, of <a href=\"http://www.northkoreatech.org\" title=\"\">North Korea Tech</a>, said that was where the similarities ended. In a blogpost on Tuesday, Williams <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/02/-sp-north-korea-hack-sony\" title=\"\">lists several inconsistencies</a> between the Sony incident and previous cyber-attacks linked to North Korea. They included the targeting of the Sony chief executive, Michael Lynton, on Sony Twitter accounts and the claim that the hack was carried out by the Guardians of Peace.</p> <p>“Attacks linked to North Korea have never included these credits,” Williams said. “Of course none of these mean that the country is definitely not involved, but it seems possible that the story is too good to be true.”</p> <p>In The Interview, which is due for release in the US on Christmas Day, Seth Rogen and James Franco play celebrity TV journalists who secure an exclusive interview with Kim and are then recruited by the CIA to kill him. A trailer of the film reveals a less than flattering portrayal of Kim, played by Randall Park, as an overweight cigar smoker.</p> <p>Having once said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/25/north-korea-merciless-response-us-kim-jong-un-film\" title=\"\">he hoped Kim would like the movie</a>, Rogen’s tone had hardened by last weekend. “I personally don’t care if [the film is] disrespectful to Kim because he’s evil. But that’s not the intent,” he tweeted on Sunday. “North Korea has produced tons of propaganda films that portray America’s destruction.” </p>","headline":"North Korea refuses to deny role in Sony

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/06/grand-budapest-hotel-review-berlin-2014-wes-anderson\">A select few had a sneak peek at Berlin in February</a>. Then, the following month - the first Friday after the Oscars in fact - the place was immediately packed out (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/10/300-rise-of-an-empire-us-box-office\">best screen averages of the year so far</a>).<br /></p> <p>In part because of this unexpected timing, it felt like even more of a treat; Christmas in spring, a birthday you’d forgotten was looming. Rather than the barrel-scraping pap which generally sets up shop in the schedule once the Oscar movies have cleared out, here, suddenly, was a flawless little miracle. A hermetic sanctuary for those battered by awards season and bracing themselves for the barren months to come.<br /></p> <p>Now, of course, Wes Anderson’s eighth feature must itself enter the fray, stand up and be counted not just in end of the year lists like this but in the 2015 awards round for which it’s eligible. Yet like last year’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/nebraska\">Nebraska</a>, it feels too delicate for such sausage-paws – an eclair in the bearpit, a diamond in the mud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/mar/07/grand-budapest-hotel-300-rise-empire-invisible-war-video-review\"                data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3nbeq\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2055455\"                data-video-name=\"The Guardian Film Show: The Grand Budapest Hotel; 300: Rise of an Empire; The Invisible War – video review\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-431480329\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/6/1391708359326/The-Grand-Budapest-Hotel-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/03/06//140306FilmShow.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow/140306FilmShow.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/03/06/140306FilmShow_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <p>But it’s this resistance to being lumped in with the others which makes it stand out; its significance – like the lapel badge sported by members of the <a href=\"http://pushkinpress.com/book/the-society-of-the-crossed-keys/\">Society of the Crossed Keys</a> – only discernible by the specially refined. </p> <p>Structurally alone, it’s a doozy. The script (discreetly filthy, a second watch confirms) a teetering stack of digressions and diversions, each fresh layer exposing a new Faberge egg beneath. It is fine-tuned yet casual, a perfect confection.<br /></p> <p>Its biggest reveal is its simplest: Ralph Fiennes can be funny. Really funny. As legendary concierge M Gustav (a part originally earmarked for Johnny Depp) he is camp, nimble, precise as a kitten and much more cute. His <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/03/travelling-light-grand-budapest-hotel-wes-anderson\">fondness for Leonard Rossiter </a>finds full expression in some of the sideways glances and quick skips here. Gustav is irresistible; Fiennes the best he’s ever been.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7616ed67b93df0edf05f69e7950628344d98c31\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/2/1417528993632/e5338743-d01b-4f36-82ce-f7573acab4a3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the appeal of the Grand Budapest also lies in it acting as an antidote to Anderson’s other movies: films about the minted and flippant, fairytale boards in which players trade quirks. Grand Budapest’s models may be only a meter or so high, but this is in many ways the most gritty manifesto he’s ever made. These people are battling fascism, as well as four-star customer service. The bereavement suffered by one is real and tearing. We see the hotel itself not just in its glory years, but at a time of brutalism, too. Such bookending means that the meat of the movie can justifiably be regarded as nostalgia, not indulgence.<br /></p> <p>Anderson’s previous signature dish was brattishness served sentimental. Here he delivers something quite different: a splendid defence of preciousness and etiquette, a rallying cry for the importance of aesthetics even in prison, even in exile. It is stirring stuff, feeling beneath the genteel. <br /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/dec/01/10-best-films-2014-the-lego-movie\">• No 10: The Lego Movie</a></p> <p><strong>Which film has topped your own list?

behaviour doesn’t mean we should take his allegations less seriously. That would be as bad as dismissing them because he is a man","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>In the sacred texts of my hysterical feminazi coven, there are a few political fixed points: women are people, my body my choice, believe victims, Chris Pratt is life. But when actor Shia LaBeouf revealed, four days ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/28/shia-labeouf-raped-performance-art-project-dazed\" title=\"\">that he was raped by a female visitor at his February performance art piece #IAMSORRY</a>, the public reaction felt anything but fixed. I saw expressions of doubt, scorn and outright rage from people across the ideological spectrum – some fellow feminists included. (Feminists, it should be noted, are also the only ones I see defending LaBeouf. The scant response from “men’s rights activists”, supposed champions of male victims, seems to mainly revolve around how effeminate LaBeouf is for not fighting his attacker hard enough.)</p> <p>And the confusion is understandable, to a degree. LaBeouf’s circumstances are unusual to the point of anomaly; his behaviour over the past decade, along with his persona itself, <a href=\"http://time.com/6094/shia%C2%ADlabeouf-plagiarism%C2%ADscandal/\" title=\"\">seems to be a study in unreliable narration</a>; and #IAMSORRY, as I understand it, was a commentary on vulnerability and violation, so how can we trust that his purported violation during a moment of self-constructed vulnerability is a genuine account and not an artistic manoeuvre to support his point?</p> <p>The fact is, it doesn’t matter. A victim doesn’t have to be relatable or reliable or likable or “normal” – or even a good person – for you to believe them. You can be utterly baffled by someone’s every move and still take their victimisation seriously. LaBeouf’s bizarre behaviour and his sexual violation are in no way mutually exclusive, nor are the latter and his gender. “He was asking for it.” “Why didn’t he fight back?” “Why didn’t he say ‘no’?” “He must have wanted it.” “He seems crazy.” These are flat-out unacceptable things to say to a person of any gender. In a culture where male victimhood is stigmatised as feminine and weak (toxic masculinity is, above all, an extension of misogyny), believing male victims isn’t oppositional to feminism, it is a feminist imperative.</p> <p>The truth is that we know almost nothing about LaBeouf’s emotional and psychological state during #IAMSORRY. But we know that in the past year <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2014/10/shia-labeouf-had-to-wear-a-hannibal-mask-in-jail-after-spitting-on-cops.html\" title=\"\">he has described his own actions as “crazy” and part of an “existential crisis”</a>, that <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/shia-labeouf-treatment-alcohol-addiction-arrest\" title=\"\">he has undergone treatment for alcohol addiction</a>, that he spent a traumatic night in jail in restraints and a Hannibal Lecter mask, and that all of this is seemingly part of a pattern of <a href=\"http://www.hollywood.com/news/brief/2435433/shia-labeouf-caught-up-in-knife-attack-shocker?page=all\" title=\"\">erratic public behaviour stretching back at least to 2005</a>. Was he even capable of consent during #IAMSORRY? I have no idea – I don’t know him. But when I’m not sure about something, I try to err on the side of compassion.</p> <p>And if you feel comfortable speculating – as most of the media has for the past decade – that LaBeouf might be grappling with some mental health and/or addiction problems, you should feel just as comfortable believing that mental illness or addiction could have impaired his consent. We are so gleeful with the diagnosis, but so dismissive of the consequences.</p> <p>Men are just as capable as women of being taken advantage of during emotionally fragile moments. Men are just as capable of freezing up and going into shock. And men are just as likely not to report their assaults, because of exactly the backlash that LaBeouf is facing now. And if he still just seems “crazy” to you, remember that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2014/sep/04/mental-illness-sexual-abuse-rape-victim\" title=\"\">mental illness makes a person more likely to be the victim of sexual assault, not less</a>.</p> <p>Whether or not you think LaBeouf recklessly threw himself into a vulnerable situation, whether or not he “could” or “should” have fought back, whether or not you think #IAMSORRY is good art or bad, literally the only thing that matters here is that a woman chose to sexually violate him. The turning point – the moment when #IAMSORRY pivoted from a goof into a horror – came not from any of LaBeouf’s choices, but from that woman’s. She did it. No one else.</p> <p>If someone had stabbed Yoko Ono during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYJ3dPwa2tI\" title=\"\">Cut Piece</a>, would we be hazy on whether or not that was murder? If someone had shot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/03/interview-marina-abramovic-performance-artist\" title=\"\">Marina Abramović</a> dead during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwPTKmFcYAQ\" title=\"\">Rhythm 0</a>, would the shooter’s choice to kill be considered irrelevant to either the criminal investigation or the meaning of Abramović’s work? No. It would have been central to both. That, in fact, is a fundamental tension of her piece – even if someone offers you dominion over their body, you still have a choice, and an ethical imperative, to respect their humanity. Unless, of course, you don’t think of them as fully human. The dehumanisation of celebrities, I think, is not irrelevant here.</p> <p>In no rational universe should LaBeouf have been expected to hang a sign in the gallery that specifies: “Please do not rape the artist.” As his collaborators clarified on Sunday: “Nowhere did we state that people could do whatever they wanted to Shia during #IAMSORRY.” And – here is the heart of it – even if they had said such a thing, the choice to beat and rape him would still have been wrong.</p>","headline":"I believe Shia LaBeouf – a person doesn’t have to be likable to be a victim","trailText":"<strong>Lindy West: </strong>The actor’s history of bizarre behaviour doesn’t mean we should take his allegations less seriously.

I sometimes hear a voice and think: “That could be a character I could do.” Of course there are many different grades, right up to the autism spectrum, and I am nowhere near that. But I sympathise with children who have it.</p> <p><strong>As I’ve grown older </strong>I’ve become less focused on show business. I am no longer writing and pitching scripts. I am much more picky about the movies I do. In the 80s and 90s I was away from my family a lot, so I am trying to make up for that by spending time with them now.</p> <p><strong>I don’t draw inspiration from my childhood. </strong>There are guys like Jim Carrey who had a miserable youth and created incredible comedy from that. But I had a great childhood in Ottawa, Canada.</p> <p><strong>James Brown showed me </strong>the responsibilities of being a band leader, with the rest of your group relying on you to keep the pay cheques coming in. Even if he was feeling down he didn’t let it affect his performance.</p> <p><strong>There is a universal life force that connects us all.</strong> I believe in an overhead cosmic godhead, a power that I draw on. But a church doesn’t have to be a church, it can just be one or more people in a room.</p> <p><strong>The death of John Belushi hit me hard. </strong>We had so much going on: a hit movie, a TV series. Suddenly I lost my partner. For a while afterwards I thought I might not come back from that.</p> <p><strong>Comedians today are more thoughtful than we were,</strong> and more grounded in real life. We did more absurdist stuff. But I love the younger guys – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jonah-hill\">Jonah Hill</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell\">Will Ferrell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/melissa-mccarthy\">Melissa McCarthy</a>. The torch has been passed.</p> <p><strong>I think of myself as a capitalist-socialist. </strong>I’m not very political, but if you had to take my leanings I’m left of centre. After Hurricane Katrina a lot of money was sucked away and never went to the rural police departments. My charity [the <a href=\"http://bluelineusa.org/\">Blue Line Foundation</a>] provides equipment and training – if you provide a car or a vest, you are tangibly making a difference.</p> <p><strong>My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy. </strong>You get on that and you don’t need a shrink. When you’re on the bike all you’re doing is concentrating on staying alive. You get into the rhythm of the road and it’s quite zen.</p> <p><strong>I’m a big fan of the British monarchy.</strong> I am lucky to have met the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward – they’re a living link with history. I look at Prince William and see a young guy with his heart and soul in the right place.</p> <p><strong>I believe in the continuous consciousness of the soul: </strong>when you die it goes off on a journey and becomes something else. You can draw on the power of those who have gone before – they will inspire and help you.</p> <p><br /><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/17/get-on-up-james-brown-chadwick-boseman\">Get On Up</a><em> is in cinemas now</em></p>","headline":"Dan Aykroyd: ‘My Harley-Davidson is a form of psychiatric therapy.

Kyle was the deadliest sniper in US military history, responsible for 160 confirmed kills during four tours of duty. Insurgents in Iraq called him the Devil of Ramadi, a monster in the shadows to be hated and feared. Comrades and supporters saw him as an American Hercules, a talismanic presence in the “war on terror”.</p> <p>Clint Eastwood stands squarely in the second camp. His gripping, incurious film gives the impression of having not so much been directed as dictated. It stares so fixedly down the rifle sight that it is finally guilty of tunnel vision.</p> <p>Is it possible to relish a drama but resent the way that it’s told? American Sniper (adapted from Kyle’s autobiography) offers a heartfelt salute to US muscle, a Green Berets for the war in Iraq; ringing with patriotic fervour and bullish male bonding. It’s lean, tough and tightly paced, darting from the rooftops of Falluja down through the ruined streets where the yellow dust swirls. But the film leaves a mass of casualties on either side of the frame.</p> <p>Bradley Cooper plays Kyle, a reformed tearaway, incensed by 9/11 and determined to defend “the greatest country on Earth”. He’s as broad as a barn and as clear-sighted as an eagle. He deals death from a distance and he makes the town safe for his men. Time and again Kyle heads back into the inferno, chasing a Syrian marksman (Sammy Sheik) who may just be his equal. Time and again he comes home with his blood pressure through the roof. His wife (Sienna Miller) has had enough of him; she’s contemplating divorce. So he sits in the garden with a thousand-yard stare. He is staring at the barbecue and seeing Iraq.</p> <p>All of which is engrossing, so far as it goes. It’s just that American Sniper is so conditioned by its first-person shooter aesthetic that it never widens its focus or pans left or right. Kyle’s wife is left hanging, while the war on Iraq is a just, noble cause. Meanwhile the Iraqis are reduced to a band of shadowy savages, darting like phantoms through the alleyways and led by a terrorist Satan who likes killing small boys with a drill. No doubt this sensibility reflects Kyle’s experience and if so, that’s fine. But I couldn’t help feeling that the film rather risks letting its man off the hook. In failing to interrogate the raw matter of Kyle’s book, it simply decides to print the legend instead.</p> <p>In one early scene, Kyle’s father tells him that the world is divided into three types: sheep, wolves and sheepdogs. Kyle sees himself as a sheepdog, a noble protector of the weak and the innocent, and it is clear that Eastwood does too. But is the world that simple? A different film (a better film) might have asked the wolves what they think, or at least wondered why the sheep behave as they do.</p> <p>American Sniper has no interest in that. The sole concession it makes is to acknowledge that the dog is sometimes traumatised by its heroic job of fending off wolves. This means it is therefore all the more deserving of a pat on the head, or a Silver Star medal, or a marble statue in its honour. In the absence of a monument, American Sniper does the job just as well.</p>","headline":"American Sniper review: Clint Eastwood’s heartfelt salute to US muscle in Iraq","trailText":"Unconcerned with

The high level of discord, he suggests, has provided him with dramatic material ever since.</p> <p>Leigh, 71, tells Yentob that his father, Dr Abe Leigh, was deeply opposed to the idea that he might become an artist or an actor. He forbade him his frequent habit of sketching visitors to the house and regarded him as a problem child because of his creative interests.</p> <p>“I was always drawing caricatures of people and he asked me to stop because he thought it might offend them,” Leigh will say. “Even the word ‘artist’ was very frightening to him, anathema. So the idea that I would be any sort of artist was terrifying to him”</p> <p>At the age of 14 Leigh was taken to see an NHS psychiatrist. “He [his father] decided I had something wrong with me mentally. So I went to see this extremely nice guy. And these were the first adult conversations I had had with another adult.”</p> <p>The psychiatrist told Leigh’s father that there was no mental problem with his son, but the news was not welcomed. “He said, ‘There is nothing wrong with him. He just doesn’t like being at home.’ My father was very angry and stopped me going. So I used to go along on my own to see him, and when my father found out about that he threatened to have him struck off the register.”</p> <p>The film director also recalls that both his parents were concerned about social appearances and about doing “the done thing”. The family moved from a working-class area of Salford out into the suburbs and their desire to conform became the centre of conflict. “I remember life at home becoming a battlefield every night,” Leigh says. “There were rows about nothing really. And what Dr Leigh was really doing, of course, was giving me a lifetime’s ammunition for my film-making. But the screaming matches were awful, terrible, horrifying to remember.”</p> <p>When the teenage Leigh, who went on to win a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, showed an interest in acting, his father urged him to shake off his ambitions as “the moonings of a stagestruck girly”.</p> <p>After failing all but three of his O-level exams, Leigh went to London to study acting in the early 1960s. He later won the role of a deaf mute in an episode of the popular TV series <em>Maigret</em>, but then lost interest in performing.</p> <p>Leigh remembers his nascent interest in film-making first taking hold when he was a boy in Salford attending a funeral, a Jewish wake or shiva held at a family home. As he watched the coffin being carried downstairs and listened to a family argument die down, Leigh tells Yentob he suddenly thought it would make a great film. “It was already a tragi-comic scene, you see,” he says.</p> <p>In London the director eventually attracted funding for his first film from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/albert-finney\" title=\"link to Guardian profile site\">the actor/director Albert Finney</a>, who was then in his mid-30s. Finney decided to use his newfound wealth to fund three films: one by Stephen Frears, who made <em>Gumshoe,</em> starring Finney; another by Tony Scott, called <em>Loving Memory</em>; and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/01/mike-leigh-on-bleak-moments\" title=\"link to Leigh on this film\">Leigh’s <em>Bleak Moments</em></a>, which was hailed by the late American film critic Roger Ebert as a masterpiece.</p> <p>In the <em>Imagine</em> documentary, Leigh talks through his early career in theatre and television, before he was finally able to attract funding to make a feature film again, 17 years later, still using his trademark improvisational techniques.</p> <p>Leigh has two sons with his former wife, the actress Alison Steadman, and, according to one of them, he may not have an entirely encouraging attitude to the arts himself. Interviewed in 2009, his son Leo Leigh, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/17/leo-leigh-swansea-love-story1\" title=\"link to Guardian interview\">also a film-maker</a>, jokingly revealed that his father had warned him away from acting “from junior school. My dad said: ‘If you become an actor, I’ll break your legs.’ ”</p> <p><em>Imagine will be screened on Tuesday 25 November at 10.35pm on BBC1 </em></p>","headline":"My home life was a battlefield: Mike Leigh tells of early traumas","trailText":"Acclaimed director of Mr Turner says family rows provided a lifetime of dramatic material","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1416002421639/Mike-Leigh-006.jpg","wordcount":"751","commentable":"true","byline":"Vanessa Thorpe","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-19T00:05:15Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/16/mike-leigh-family-conflict","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/16/mike-leigh-family-conflict","tags":[{"id":"film/mikeleigh","webTitle":"Mike Leigh","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mikeleigh","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/mikeleigh","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"media/bbc1","webTitle":"BBC1","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc1","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/bbc1","references":[]},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/bbc","references":[]},{"id":"media/television","webTitle":"Television industry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/television","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/television","references":[]},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/media","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/media","references":[]},{"id":"media/alan-yentob","webTitle":"Alan Yentob","type":"keyword","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/alan-yentob","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/alan-yentob","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news/uknews","webTitle":"News","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news/uknews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news/uknews","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/news","webTitle":"Main section","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/news","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theobserver","webTitle":"The Observer","type":"publication","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theobserver","references":[]},{"id":"profile/vanessathorpe","webTitle":"Vanessa Thorpe","rcsId":"GNL004779","r2ContributorId":"16548","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/1/1367419199456/Vanessa-Thorpe.jpg","firstName":"","lastName":"thorpe","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Vanessa Thorpe is arts and media correspondent on the Observer</p>","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/vanessathorpe","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/vanessathorpe","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"gu-fc-48383b12-3997-4fee-bc65-2514761208d8","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1416002427844/Mike-Leigh-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Karen Robinson","displayCredit":"false","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/14/1416002427844/Mike-Leigh-011.jpg","source":"Observer","photographer":"Karen Robinson","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"Mike Leigh","suppliersReference":"Mike Leigh","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Karen Robinson/Observer","caption":"Mike Leigh says his nascent interest in film-making first took hold as a boy in Salford.

There he changed his name to Mohamed Husen and appeared in films alongside some of the country’s most famous actors, sometimes in movies that championed German imperialism, before ending up in a concentration camp for having an on-set interracial relationship.</p> <p>“I didn’t know much about Africans in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s,” says Knopf. “It seems like German people’s awareness of colonialism was washed away because of the second world war and the Holocaust. We lost our colonies after the first world war, so we felt we didn’t have to deal with them any more. Our history with them didn’t reach into the 1950s and 1960s like it did in many other European countries. So, the metaphor of the extra represents both the extras themselves and the absence of Africans from the German imagination.”</p> <p>Born in 1905, Husen volunteered, aged nine, for the Askari, elite native troops who helped Germany keep a tight grip on its dominions. “No one in Germany would expect that Kaiser Wilhelm had child soldiers,” reflects Knopf. “Some would carry weapons to the frontline. This was very dangerous anyway, but they couldn’t even use the weapons to defend themselves.”</p> <p>Husen’s father died during the first world war and he, too, was injured in service. Later, he got a job as a ship steward and sailed to Hamburg before heading to Berlin where, defiantly and unsuccessfully, he demanded back wages he claimed were owed to his family. He was instructed to leave the country, but the order wasn’t carefully administered and he stayed on without papers. He married a white actor, fathered a child by his mistress and eked out a living by working in costume at a cowboy-themed bar, at an Africa-themed circus and as a Swahili teacher at Berlin University’s Foreign Institute, where he primed civil servants for life in Africa.</p> <p>At this time, port and working-class communities in Hamburg and Berlin had significant black populations. The popularity of performers such as Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson offered migrants the chance to pretend to be from the US. Often they drifted between jobs in cabaret, dance and acting. Husen found blink-and-miss-them roles as a bellboy, a waiter and a saloon-bar lag, which, says Knopf, were two-dimensional. “He and other black performers were portrayed more or less as children.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04aba0fad913789f7671035c98990addd8b7e4e0\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415897646928/835214dd-973f-4157-b88d-d72abe8d5455-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"majub statue\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A statue of Majub, whose story was pieced together by director Eva Knopf. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rainer Hoffmann</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet, for many German Africans, life on a film set was better than life outside. The studio was a safety zone, a place of make-believe rather than austere reality, a money-earning gig, a hub for gossip and friendship. According to Dorothea Diek, quoted in Robbie Aitken and Eve Rosenhaft’s study Black Germany (2013), “It was cheerful and cosy: no politics, no Nazis, just happy people. We were all together – young and old Africans.” On the set of Husen’s last film, German Africans were so aghast at the shivering, emaciated Togolese PoWs they performed alongside that they banded together to give them cigarettes and clothes.</p> <p>It was also on that set that Husen’s fortunes took a dramatic tumble. He was playing Ramazan, the loyal servant of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsvV6DwsrY0\">Carl Peters</a> in Herbert Selpin’s 1941 biopic of the German explorer and Scramble for Africa conquistador. Peters was infamous for executing his black mistress after he discovered she was having an affair with his man-servant. Husen was denounced by an informant for his extramarital affair and sent, purportedly for his own safety, to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp\">Sachsenhausen</a>, where he died four years later.</p> <p>Other film-makers might have portrayed Husen as a pioneer or hero, a symbol of Germany’s far-from-glorious relationship with people of African descent. Knopf’s screenplay is spare and ruminative, as keen to point out how little is – and could be – known about him as it is to celebrate his life. “I don’t know if I liked him,” she says. “He wasn’t what the Nazis wanted him to be – a proper Askari. But nor was he what we would want him to be – an anti-colonial freedom fighter or an anti-fascist.” Indeed, by the mid-1930s, he was dressing up in military gear and appearing at rallies in front of banners bearing the slogan “Germany needs colonies”. “He went his own way. He doesn’t fit any clear-cut patterns of how we might think about history.”</p> <p>Some may think Husen a chump. What kind of fool would have travelled to a recent imperial giant hoping for social recognition or economic justice? “He took the Germans at their word,” suggests Knopf. “He was never meant to appear in Germany. He was just a fantasy, a story they told about themselves and about how faithful the Askari were and how much the Germans honoured them. You have to wonder: did he just not understand what he was doing?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://vimeo.com/77801442\"                                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/77801442\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The trailer for Majub’s Journey, featuring footage of the actor from the era.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Husen’s life is rich in mystery. No diaries, correspondence or personal photographs appear to have survived. Knopf found a sheet of notepaper that he had personally designed, but it contained no writing. His name would not have been listed in credit sequences, and no trade magazines would have interviewed him; after all, as the film’s narrator comments, “extras are there only for the clothes they wear and the spot of moving colour that they bring to the screen.”</p> <p>His 12-year-old son, Heinz Bodo, supposedly collected his father’s ashes, but it seems likely that he died soon after during the bombing of Berlin.</p> <p>In a sense, Husen is a ghost, one who, like many immigrants from formerly colonised nations, is barely visible even upon arriving at the imperial centre. What non-filmic traces of him exist are down to his run-ins with the authorities – asking for help with rent, seeking compensation for military valour. Immersing herself in the archives, watching countless films from the period, trying to make out Husen in scenes captured on now-degraded stock, Knopf became a kind of surveillance operative. At the same time, she worried that bringing these forgotten images back into circulation would heap fresh humiliation on him.</p> <p>Yet, what makes Majub’s Journey so compelling is its artfully conveyed tension between the desire to liberate Husen from anonymity and the suspicion that his absence from the cinephilic record may be a blessing in disguise. “History is often written on the basis of what survives,” says Knopf. “But there are all these histories and tragedies and lost voices and souls that also shape the way our world is today. When you screen these films, you can make these ghosts appear again.”</p>","headline":"Mohamed Husen: the black immigrant actor who carved out a career in 1930s German cinema","trailText":"<strong>Sukhdev Sandhu</strong>: A new film tells the unlikely story of Mohamed Husen, the African former child soldier who emigrated to Germany and appeared alongside the biggest film stars of the Nazi era","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415896952993/majud-003.jpg","wordcount":"1158","commentable":"true","byline":"Sukhdev Sandhu","productionOffice":"UK","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T18:30:00+00:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/13/mohamed-husen-black-immigrant-actor-carved-career-1920s-german-cinema","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/nov/13/mohamed-husen-black-immigrant-actor-carved-career-1920s-german-cinema","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"world/secondworldwar","webTitle":"Second world war","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/secondworldwar","references":[]},{"id":"world/firstworldwar","webTitle":"First world war","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/firstworldwar","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/firstworldwar","references":[]},{"id":"world/holocaust","webTitle":"Holocaust","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/holocaust","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/holocaust","references":[]},{"id":"film/documentary","webTitle":"Documentary","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/documentary","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/documentary","references":[]},{"id":"film/world-cinema","webTitle":"World cinema","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/world-cinema","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/world-cinema","references":[]},{"id":"world/germany","webTitle":"Germany","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/germany","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/sukhdev-sandhu","webTitle":"Sukhdev Sandhu","r2ContributorId":"44412","firstName":"sukhdev","lastName":"sandhu","type":"contributor","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/sukhdev-sandhu","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/profile/sukhdev-sandhu","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2/film-and-music","webTitle":"Film and music","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2/film-and-music","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/g2","webTitle":"G2","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/g2","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/g2","references":[]}],"references":[],"elements":[{"id":"cc3f8aba92fb1573e48d4947c5f03f3a1415b096","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415896959670/majud-008.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Publicity image","displayCredit":"true","secureFile":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415896959670/majud-008.jpg","source":"Filmakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg","imageType":"Photograph","altText":"majud","height":"276","credit":"Photograph: Filmakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg","caption":"A still from one of Majub’s films.

That’s who I’m gonna call.”</p> <p>The original Ghostbusters movie is like a lot of other films: the story of a group of men whose technological innovation, devil-may-care attitude and entrepreneurial spirit lead them to take advantage of an unexpected spike in demand. It’s just that their particular good fortune was a paranormal invasion of New York City.</p> <p>But it was a huge hit, making more at the box office than anything else in 1984 but Beverly Hills Cop (<a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1984&amp;p=.htm\">and that includes</a> Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). </p> <p>The new movie will not be a sequel so much as a “total reboot”, Variety <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/paul-feig-ghostbusters-comedy-reboot-1201274332/\">has reported</a>. Ivan Reitman, who directed the original movie and Ghostbusters II, dropped out of directing a third movie in the series in March, the report said.</p> <p>It’s not that there were no hilarious women in the original movie, which was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and starred the writers plus Bill Murray. In Ghostbusters, Sigourney Weaver plays a New Yorker whose apartment in <a href=\"http://www.bigwaste.com/photos/ny/ghostbusters/barrett.shtml\">55 Central Park West</a> becomes haunted. So she commutes to <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hook-and-ladder-8-ghostbusters-new-york\">Hook &amp; Ladder 8</a> in Tribeca, where the Ghostbusters have set up their headquarters. Before the movie is over she delivers witty ripostes to Murray’s jokes, levitates over a bed and makes love to Rick Moranis. (Weaver has announced her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/09/ghostbusters-3-sigourney-weaver-son\">son would appear</a> in the third film.)</p> <p>There should be ample opportunity for the writers of the new movie to riff on the original, which used sex as a metaphor for the ghost apocalypse, with Weaver playing the “gatekeeper”, Moranis playing the “keymaster” and their unearthly offspring embodied by a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=slavitza+jovan&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1418&amp;bih=1038&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IKg1VPztL5Dd7Qb_v4DYDg&amp;ved=0CCAQsAQ\">Serbian supermodel</a>. </p> <p>One thing they’ll have a hard time beating: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9We2XsVZfc\">that theme song</a>.</p>","headline":"Women-led Ghostbusters reboot is official: who they gonna cast?","trailText":"Bridesmaids’ Paul Feig announces he will direct and co-write reboot about women of paranormal pest extermination team","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/8/1412804742672/90a36f67-0b04-46dd-bd66-991f0799fabd-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"352","commentable":"true","byline":"Tom McCarthy in New York","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-10-11T22:36:53Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/08/new-ghostbusters-paul-feig-women-reboot-stars","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/oct/08/new-ghostbusters-paul-feig-women-reboot-stars","tags":[{"id":"film/ghostbusters","webTitle":"Ghostbusters","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/ghostbusters","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/comedy","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/tommccarthy","webTitle":"Tom McCarthy","r2ContributorId":"49576","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/24/1382626910884/tom-mccarthy.jpg","firstName":"tom","lastName":"mccarthy","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Tom McCarthy is a live blogger and reporter at the Guardian US.

still sticks – review","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-26T17:28:26Z","sectionName":"Film","sectionId":"film","id":"film/2014/sep/26/kill-the-messenger-gary-webb-review","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/42vdc","standfirst":"<p>It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes, but much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game</p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>He has a sturdy build, a clear moral compass, wears cool sunglasses and rides a vintage motorcycle. Everything about Jeremy Renner’s portrayal of journalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb\">Gary Webb</a> in Kill the Messenger readies a conditioned moviegoer to expect him to kick ass in the name of justice. But this is a movie for grownups, so <a href=\"http://www.blastr.com/2013-5-16/rumor-day-jeremy-renner%E2%80%99s-being-replaced-hawkeye-avengers-2\">The Avengers’ Hawkeye</a> puts down the bow and arrow and picks up his pen – or more specifically his mid-90s desktop mouse – and uses his brain instead of his brawn. </p> <p>Webb was the relatively small potatoes reporter at the San Jose Mercury News whose fearlessness and determination helped him break an amazing story, and Renner gives this role everything he’s got.</p> <p>As a middle schooler in the 80s, I befriended some older kids who read ‘zines and listened to the Clash and wore jackets with tiny pins on them like Rick from the Young Ones. One such pin read CIA: Cocaine Import Agency. Even suburban twerps from New Jersey suspected that the government was pumping crack into the inner cities and using the cash to fund anti-communist Nicaraguan militias. There was never any proof of this – at least not then, but a decade later Gary Webb connected many of the dots in a series of articles that, at first, had him hailed as the next Woodward and Bernstein, but that’s only the first half of the story. The second part, and, frankly, the more interesting part, shows how forces conspired to bury the story. </p> <p>“Some stories are too true to tell,” warns Michael Sheen as the DC insider beside a reflecting pool – where all movies are forced by law to shoot the scene where a DC insider warns reporters they are in too deep. But Webb won’t be waved away. Not because he has an anti-government radical agenda, but because he’s still naïve enough to think that a journalist owes his first duty to the truth. </p> <p>After the initial splash of success comes the backlash. The CIA refutes every claim (naturally) and even do a little psy-ops on him. But the CIA doesn’t have to destroy Webb when his so-called colleagues are there to do the job. </p> <p>Bigger papers like the Washington Post are humiliated that they got scooped by a pipsqueak outlet like the San Jose Mercury News, and with the aid of the CIA’s mouthpiece they commence with the policy of CYA (Cover Your Ass). By tearing Webb’s story apart (and, by extension, Webb himself) the mainstream press can sweep all this under the rug.</p> <p>It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes. Yet the film in total – if I may paraphrase Webb’s critics – has a number of holes. Its use of newsy exposition montage is deplorable (the pre-title sequence is exhausting) and a number of characters just drop in to shove the plot along to its next checkpoint.</p> <p>Much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game than drama. Director Michael Cuesta (best known for helming cable shows like Homeland and Dexter) makes a few choices that aren’t exactly what you’d call subtle. He’s got Barry Pepper as the sleazy government operative and Michael Kenneth Williams as the drug dealer primed with bon mots. And when Webb sits down to actually bang out his report he cranks The Clash’s “Know Your Rights.” (Those pin-wearing chums from school would be proud.) When Webb gives a rousing speech endorsing truth, justice and the American way at the film’s conclusion, he’s at a banquet and the light off the back curtain frames him with a golden halo.</p> <p>And yet what Renner’s selling still sticks, because he’s just that sympathetic (and, of course, on the right side of the issues.) I remember when the Webb story broke and then I also remember people shoo-ing it away. What I didn’t remember was the aftermath. I won’t spoil too much of that here, but <em>why</em> I don’t remember it is clear: when evidence supporting Webb’s claim came to light, it had the misfortune of surfacing when the American media had its eyes exclusively on Bill Clinton’s zipper.</p> <p>Kill the Messenger (like Webb) is clear about the line between fact and conjecture – but the facts alone make this an “issue film” worth seeing.<br /></p>","headline":"Kill The Messenger: the Gary Webb story has holes but Renner's performance still sticks – review","trailText":"It’s a great story that lends itself to some striking scenes, but much of the screenplay feels more like a reporter’s video game","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/26/1411750078616/8bdc8a15-6d88-4ea2-a320-4447cfb21e1f-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"713","commentable":"true","starRating":"3","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-29T17:28:36Z"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/26/kill-the-messenger-gary-webb-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/sep/26/kill-the-messenger-gary-webb-review","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/actionandadventure","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/actionandadventure","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","webTitle":"Article","type":"type","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","webTitle":"Reviews","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

festival","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-25T15:35:57Z","sectionName":"Film","sectionId":"film","id":"film/2014/sep/25/fantastic-fest-austin-texas-hedonism","fields":{"shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4xp8x","standfirst":"<p>Fantastic Fest specializes in extremes and this year is no exception, with programming ranging from Norwegian psychological horror to a documentary about slime moulds<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"false","body":"<p>“You wanna fire a shotgun?”<br /><br />It’s a strange enough question on its own, but it was even stranger considering that just a few hours earlier the speaker sold me a cream and Froot Loops-based Mexican popsicle of his own creation called the Saturday Morning Cartoon. </p> <p>This mix of machismo, nostalgia and high-fructose hedonism is endemic to Austin, Texas, a town with a large college campus and tech industry jobs for the young and playful and their disposable incomes. Many local businesses may claim to be the “heart” of the city, but for film lovers it is undoubtedly the <a href=\"http://drafthouse.com/austin\">Alamo Drafthouse</a>, which just celebrated the 10th anniversary of its in-house film festival, <a href=\"http://fantasticfest.com/\">Fantastic Fest.<br /></a><br />Fantastic Fest specializes in extremes – this year the programming ranged from far-out Mexican science fiction to Norwegian psychological horror to a British documentary about slime molds to a lewd parody of the Italian “giallo” to a gangland hip-hop opera from Japan. There are always a handful of movies that are already en route to a release in mainstream cinemas, but for many these are the afterthoughts. </p> <p>The pride a Fantastic Fest-goer feels comes from seeing something so twisted and deranged the Chinese government won’t let it out of the country without strings attached. (A Fantastic Fest programmer told a tale of recruiting his girlfriend for translation duties to acquire one such film.) The extra-cinematic activities, frequently based in The Highball, a restaurant/bar/arcade/karaoke facility attached to the theater, similarly run the gamut. The same stage that hosted “Nerd Rap” featured an hourlong Q&amp;A with the charming elder statesman of cinephilia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Maltin\">Leonard Maltin</a>.</p> <p>While the organized trip to go off and fire shotguns may have just been pure Texas, most of the zany tie-ins have a thematic connection. An organized pie-fight after the repertory screening of Alan Parker’s Bugsy Malone makes perfect sense in context, as the 1976 film, which cast kid actors like Scott Baio and Jodie Foster as 1920s gangsters, swapped bullets for pie cream for the shootouts.<br /><br />Catching an archival print of Bugsy Malone on a big screen with a top notch sound system was a personal highlight, and made for an amusing counterpoint to the debut of Keanu Reeves’ new action picture John Wick. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9151bf19-ced8-400a-9f40-3428fca5735f\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411568564471/3b7b3477-73d5-484b-b898-b6eda05ac6e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"John Wick\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reeves doesn’t act too much, but looks cool in his upcoming film John Wick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fantastic Fest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Directed by former stuntmen David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, John Wick is a perfect vehicle for Reeves as he glides into the next phase of his career. Bluntly, he doesn’t have to act much, but he has to look cool wearing a suit while shooting people at close range with automatic weapons. As the titular character (the full name is repeated so many times that the drinking game is surely around the corner) Reeves is a former hit-man who just wants a quiet life. But when the bratty son of the Russian Mob (played by Game of Thrones’ Theon Greyjoy!) steals his car and kills his dog, the spirit of vengeance is unleashed. </p> <p>So far pretty standard, but when John Wick goes “back on the job” the movie takes a creative leap into satire and surrealism. We enter an underworld of contract killers and the service industry that caters to their trade. As such, John Wick has some of the best hotelier jokes in a movie since Neil Simon’s Plaza Suite. This tweak at realism gives the movie a little extra wiggle room, and as such the extreme violence comes off as strangely charming. John Wick is not the direct-to-DVD feature you’d suspect from the poster.<br /><br />Another debuting film that made a splash was Isaac Ezban’s The Incident (El Incidente). I know this doesn’t sound like an endorsement, but it’s been a while since I’ve witnessed the uncomfortable confusion and frustration that accompany nightmares put to film in such a way. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-e4a5d00c-903d-4b8a-bd2f-b7a434fe2c05\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/24/1411578015093/1ff010ed-4f82-4ee0-9b3e-99c775a0480c-460x276.png\" alt=\"Fantastic Fest The Incident\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The Incident isn’t a graphic or violent movie, but a gripping psychological torture session.’ </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fantastic Fest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Incident isn’t a graphic or violent movie, but a gripping psychological torture session. Until its revelatory ending it seems like two not-very-connected Twilight Zone stories. In one, a cop and two thuggish brothers (one shot in the leg) are trapped in a stairwell. In the other, a family with a sick child is on a road trip that offers no exits. The simple “what if?” scenarios play out in ways that seem ludicrous at first, but jibe with the film’s peculiar internal logic. The production design and world building are extraordinary, especially considering that the movie was most likely made on a minuscule budget. This is Mexican director Isaac Ezban’s first feature film, and I can’t wait to see what he’s got in store next.</p> <p>Additional highlights include films that may have made their debut elsewhere, like the just-wrapped Toronto film festival, but perhaps needed a more likeminded venue to cut above the chatter. One such title was Tokyo Tribe, Sian Sono’s relentless rap-battle martial arts epic set in fantasy land of violent, warring crews. If The Warriors were rebooted as an absurdist live-action anime musical with lots of foulmouth humor and nudity, you’d have the soil ready to grow such a film. </p> <p>I’m not going to lie and say this movie is good, but considering the Drafthouse brings beer directly to the table and encourages hootin’ and hollerin’ when diminutive and adorably clad women suddenly reveal themselves to be furious henchmen-destroying ass-kickers, it’s fair to say everyone had a really good time. Some of the raps had key phrases in English, so hundreds of giddy cinema-goers exited the screening chanting “Tokyo Tribe, never ever die!” as they made their way back to the bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1098b1e9-fab9-4999-92cb-73df4c68c793\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/25/1411654355817/e53c4fc2-80f1-4e41-b3d3-bbeefa4672b9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tokyo Tribe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tokyo Tribe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fantastic Fest</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br />Another Toronto premiere that popped up was Spring, a bizarre romantic drama that takes a left turn into monster mythology. “HP Lovecraft’s Before Sunrise” is how some were summarizing. The sweet, sincere and scary picture (from film-making team Benson &amp; Moorehead) had the good fortune to announce an acquisition deal at the fest – from the Alamo Drafthouse’s distribution arm Drafthouse Films. Those not in the know may think that a theater chain specializing in bringing queso dip and suds directly to your seat has no business in distributing films, but in just four years they’ve had two pictures nominated for Academy Awards (Belgian crime tale Bullhead and the Indonesian documentary The Act of Killing.)<br /><br />From elsewhere in the fest, I was quite taken with the The Creeping Garden, a look at the mysterious world of slime molds (really) from both a scientific and artistic point of view. The movie hums as if it was shot by aliens visiting Earth for the first time, and that’s a high compliment. I also enjoyed watching hardcore cinephiles react to Peter Strickland’s The Duke of Burgundy and Miroslav Slaboshpytskiy’s The Tribe. The first is a stylized but ultimately tender tale of a May-December lesbian BDSM romance set in a world without men, and the second is a Ukrainian film set at a school for the deaf that doubles as a prostitution headquarters. The Tribe, shot in long, wide takes, is entirely in sign language without subtitles. It will be distributed by Drafthouse Films and I think the strangeness of its description works as a good indicator for what Fantastic Fest and Drafthouse is all about.</p>","headline":"Machismo and hedonism at Fantastic Fest: America's wildest film festival","trailText":"Fantastic Fest specializes in extremes and this year is no exception, with programming ranging from Norwegian psychological horror to a documentary about slime moulds<br>","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/25/1411655241423/37f9ef18-37aa-4fbb-b487-9d214e37c26e-140x84.jpeg","wordcount":"1213","commentable":"true","byline":"Jordan Hoffman","productionOffice":"US","liveBloggingNow":"false","commentCloseDate":"2014-09-28T11:30:00-04:00"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/25/fantastic-fest-austin-texas-hedonism","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/sep/25/fantastic-fest-austin-texas-hedonism","tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/film","references":[]},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/festivals","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/austin","webTitle":"Austin","description":"The latest news and comment on Austin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/austin","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/austin","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"film/keanureeves","webTitle":"Keanu Reeves","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/keanureeves","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/film/keanureeves","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/us-news","references":[]},{"id":"us-news/texas","webTitle":"Texas","type":"keyword","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/texas","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","webTitle":"Features","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","webTitle":"News","type":"tone","webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"profile/jordan-hoffman","webTitle":"Jordan Hoffman","r2ContributorId":"64308","bylineImageUrl":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/23/1403542588719/Jordan-Hoffman-profile-pi-003.jpg","firstName":"jordan","lastName":"hoffman","type":"contributor","bio":"<p>Jordan Hoffman is a writer and critic based in New York City.

some filmmakers, climate change is now the equivalent of the nuclear scares of the mid-20th century<br></p>","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>As we have begun to see the effects of climate change more severely, more frequently and closer to home, so too have film-makers been spurred to address the consequences of an irrevocably damaged environment in new ways. In both fiction and non-fiction, climate change is no longer depicted as the eventual cause of future calamity, but a reality affecting everyday life. <br /></p> <p>On the heels of documentaries that hoped to raise awareness by laying out the facts about climate change have come new ones showing the consequences of our behavior through spectacular images of an increasingly inhospitable environment. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/114266/inconvenient.truth\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, that PowerPoint presentation of a documentary from 2006, stands as a prototype of activist filmmaking, the kind of movie that caused Roger Ebert to write, apparently for the first time in his career, “you owe it to yourself to see this film.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4c55d78c-f5a3-4e1b-9247-9bacff0ab8de\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/19/1411156348437/ee785cf9-83ed-42db-9585-80c3dbc818e8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An Inconvenient Truth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“Gore leads viewers with calm determination through facts and figures, laying out the problem at hand”</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It bets on the power of reason: Gore leads viewers with calm determination through facts and figures, laying out the problem at hand. ‘How can you ignore the truth?’, the film seems to ask.<br /></p> <p>Years later, it seems Gore’s ‘truth-telling’ hasn’t been as successful as he’d hoped, and a series of more recent docs have broached new ways of approaching the issue. </p> <p>James Balog’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/13/chasing-ice-review\">Chasing Ice</a> is no less eager to change the mindset and behavior of its audience than Inconvenient Truth; in fact, Balog explicitly states at the beginning that he is former climate change skeptic who has now seen the light, positioning his film as a hopeful catalyst for other similar transformations. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIZTMVNBjc4\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eIZTMVNBjc4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>But Balog is also a photographer by trade, and his approach is correspondingly more visual than Guggenheim’s in Inconvenient Truth: the doc follows him and his crew as they trek into the Arctic and produce multi-year timelapse videos that dramatically show the melting of ice caps and glaciers. Inconvenient Truth, of course, also had photos displaying similar evidence, but Balog’s images go much further. </p> <p>Beyond eliciting understanding, they’re clearly produced to inspire awe. </p> <p>The images that Edward Burtynsky and Jennifer Baichwal produce in their documentary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/04/watermark-review-documentary-jennifer-baichwal\">Watermark</a> are equally striking. Unlike Chasing Ice, Watermark is not exclusively concerned with climate change. Its focus is on water in general, the ways we live with it, use it in religious worship, and attempt to control it. </p> <p>There’s certainly a romanticizing element to the film; Like Balog, Burtynsky is a photographer and much of the doc shows him taking wondrous shots of environmental landscapes—of sprawling farmland, rivers, and rice terraces. But knowing what we do about climate change, the images of these locales carry a spectral warning of their vulnerability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvarPeJpkM\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvarPeJpkM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In a sense, then, Watermark takes for granted a certain amount of environmental awareness. It certainly places climate change within a larger panorama of issues, which is the same thing that many recent narrative films have done. </p> <p>Most often, climate change appears in fictional movies like The Day After Tomorrow, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/20/snowpiercer-first-look-review-edinburgh-2014\">Snowpiercer</a>, or – remarkably ahead of its time – Waterworld as a set-up or explanation for disaster. In films like Night Moves and Beasts of the Southern Wild, though, it becomes a basic fact of the world we live in. </p> <p>The two movies are miles apart in tone: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/01/venice-film-festival-night-moves-review\">Night Moves</a> is a low-key thriller about three environmental activists planning to bomb a dam in Oregon; <em>Beasts</em> is an exuberant quasi-fantasy set in an isolated Louisiana community as it prepares for, and then deals with the aftermath of a large storm. </p> <p>Yet in their own ways—whether by realistically profiling characters determined to force decreased consumption or by magically positing the existence of a raging band of aurochs, thawed out after centuries of captivity in the Arctic ice caps – both offer stories that sense that the end of Gore’s 10-year warning approaches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5U4TtYpKIc\"                                                                                > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5U4TtYpKIc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>In that respect, perhaps the best film we have about climate change is Jeff Nichols’s Take Shelter. Much like the 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, but with more compelling results, Take Shelter signals how climate change has become our equivalent to the mid-20th century nuclear scare. The movie tells the story of Curtis, who begins having visions of deadly storms and, to the dismay of his family, proceeds to spend all his time and money building a storm shelter. </p> <p>As a film about contemporary anxieties, Curtis’s visions could symbolize a number of fears, but it’s not hard to tell which is the most pressing and obvious one. Throughout the film, Curtis repeats his warnings, continues his plans, and his demeanor in doing so can only be described as paranoid. Yet we all live with the prospect of similar threats and what’s most worrisome, then, is how we seem a little less crazy every new day that we repeat them.</p>","headline":"After An Inconvenient

<p><strong>Entertainment grade: A–</strong></p> <p><strong>History grade: A–</strong></p> <p>From 1984-85, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/07/arthur-scargill-miners-strike\">National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) went on strike</a> in Britain. Among their supporters was a group called Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners (LGSM). </p> <h2>Strike</h2> <p>The film begins with footage of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/arthur-scargill\">NUM leader Arthur Scargill</a> on the television, and following him a particularly terrifying clip of Margaret Thatcher. “One isn’t here to be a softie,” she intones with a fixed, creepy smile, looking like Cruella de Vil about to skin a baby panda with her teeth. “I’m here to be a good, firm leader.” Scargill declared a national miners’ strike on 12 March 1984. At London’s Gay Pride March on 30 June, leftie activist Mark Ashton (played by Ben Schnetzer) argues that lesbian and gay people should support the miners – for both groups are oppressed by the government and the tabloid press. “The only problem we’ve got that they haven’t is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Mary Whitehouse</a>,” he says, “and that can only be a matter of time.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/sep/03/bill-nighy-pride-interview-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2151941\"                data-video-name=\"Bill Nighy on Pride: 'It's amazing no one knows the story' – video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/9/3/1409740058414/Pride-film-017.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-446190138\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/9/3/1409740042835/Pride-film-007.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/09/03/140903PrideJunket-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/09/03/140903PrideJunket/140903PrideJunket.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/09/03/140903PrideJunket_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/09/03/140903PrideJunket_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/09/03/140903PrideJunket.webm\"></source> </video> </figure>  <h2>Activism</h2> <p>Mark doesn’t get a lot of support immediately: a gay man from Durham responds angrily that the miners used to beat him up back home. But a small LGSM group is formed, and resolves to raise money for a mining community. They just aren’t sure which one. “Somewhere north, industrial?” says one. “Humberside? Is that a place?” Most of the miners hang up on them when they call, until eventually they get hold of the Dulais Valley Lodge in south Wales. This was indeed one of the first lodges to accept LGSM support, along with Neath and Swansea Valleys.</p> <h2>Politics</h2> <p>Miner Dai Donovan (Paddy Considine) turns up in London to meet Mark and his comrades, and LGSM’s fundraising and solidarity movement is on its way. A short documentary film made in February 1985, called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHJhbwEcgrA\">All Out! Dancing in Dulais</a>, reveals that Pride has really done its research. The attention to historical detail in terms of characters, design and tone is superb, even if the new film does occasionally resort to mocking the lesbian separatists. One difference you might notice is the film’s relative reluctance to use words like “socialism”. Perhaps it’s trying not to alienate too many American viewers, who may be able to tolerate a few friendly queer folk – but might prefer rampant Marxists stayed firmly in the closet. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/aug/20/pride-george-mackay-clip-gay-rights-miners-video\"                        data-show-ads=\"true\"                data-video-id=\"2145183\"                data-video-name=\"Pride: watch George MacKay in an exclusive clip from the drama about the gay rights activists who joined the miners' protest - video\"                data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"                data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/20/1408547334136/Still-from-Pride-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-445072845\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/8/20/1408547331182/Still-from-Pride-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/08/21/140820Pride-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/08/21/140820Pride_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/08/21/140820Pride/140820Pride.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/08/21/140820Pride.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/08/21/140820Pride_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> </figure>  <h2>Characters</h2> <p>LGSM visit the Dulais valley. “Think I’m starting to freak out slightly,” says actor Jonathan Blake (Dominic West), faced with a room full of Welsh miners. In the film, Blake’s partner is a Welshman called Gethin (Andrew Scott). In real life, his partner was a non-Welshman called Nigel, but screenwriter Stephen Beresford has clearly had to reduce the cast to a manageable number for a feature film. Likewise, in the film, there are about 10 LGSM members sleeping on Dai’s floor. In real life, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/31/pride-film-gay-activists-miners-strike-interview\">according to the real Dai</a>, there were 27. Very cosy.</p> <h2>Health</h2> <p>Pride must also be commended for its subtle yet powerful handling of the HIV/Aids story, which was hugely significant at the time but here remains mostly in the background. It does, however, make accurate nods to the historical context, quoting the notorious words of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4348096.stm\">Manchester chief constable James Anderton</a> describing gay men “swirling about in a human cesspit of their own making”, and showing the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMnb536WuC0\">Department of Health’s Don’t Die of Ignorance commercial</a>.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1044eb4d-5879-4a80-bf4d-ad3241e42472\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/17/1410951201784/ec96d533-1482-42c0-bd5b-18c68d8d8f3a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paddy Considine in Pride\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Opting to respect and empower anyone willing to fight the good fight’: Pride.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Dove/Nicola Dove</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br /></h2> <h2>Media</h2> <p>A newspaper gets hold of the story of LGSM, splashing it as “perverts support the pits”. Just as the film skips past socialism, it goes to some lengths to avoid mentioning that this newspaper was the Sun. Possibly it would be impolitic for a small British film to offend Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire when it needs good reviews. In any case, LGSM turn this around by hosting a “Pits and Perverts” party in London’s Electric Ballroom, raising thousands of pounds in the process.

actor has shown a willingness to play with his persona with two meaty roles at the Toronto film festival that belie his slapstick image","hasStoryPackage":"true","body":"<p>Film festivals tend to be rarefied, high-fibre affairs. But the audiences at Toronto, which kicks off  on Thursday, will be clapping eyes on not one but two Adam Sandler movies: The Cobbler and Men, Women &amp; Children. That's the same Adam Sandler who played the dual roles of an advertising executive and his shrill twin sister in Jack and Jill, not to mention an Israeli commando turned Manhattan hairdresser (\"I just want to make people silky-smooth!\") in You Don't Mess with the Zohan.</p><p>However, this is a tale of two Sandlers. There is the goofy 47-year-old actor and writer whose sleepy chipmunk face and everyman demeanour give no hint of his estimated $300m (£180m)fortune – nor the $25m price-tag (including producer's fee) that comes with his participation on a movie.</p><p>His company, Happy Madison Productions, takes its name from a hybrid of two of his earliest hits (the 1995 back-to-school comedy Billy Madison and its golfing follow-up Happy Gilmore) and features in its logo the face of his late father, Stanley Sandler, a Brooklyn electrical engineer from Russian immigrant stock.</p><p>Recent successes for the company include Sandler's two Grown Ups movies, which between them earned more than $500m worldwide, as well as projects starring proteges such as Kevin James, whose Paul Blart: Mall Cop grossed $183m on a meagre $26m budget. All of which must make for an exceedingly Happy Madison.</p><p>The other Sandler is more unorthodox. Ever since he departed briefly from his own lucrative brand to star in Paul Thomas Anderson's skew-whiff rom-com Punch-Drunk Love in 2002, he has shown an occasional willingness to tamper and toy with his persona. In that film, he played a milquetoast whose rage issues emerge when he is exploited in a phone-sex scam. Perhaps it is the proximity of comedy and aggression (comics like to \"slay\" or \"kill\" their audiences, after all) that makes it strangely appropriate to see Sandler showing a more serious and volatile side.</p><p>Such an offbeat endeavour can't expect to enjoy much crossover potential with the Sandler fan base. But it does display a sense of adventure and dexterity seen in established comics chafing against their image.</p><p>Bill Murray co-wrote and starred in a 1984 adaptation of Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge – in the same year as Ghostbusters no less. Steve Martin couldn't have found a sharper contrast to his own loopy vaudevillian vehicles than the lead in the grim 1981 film version of Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven.</p><p>Similarly, Sandler proved in Punch-Drunk Love, and in other complex parts that pepper his CV (such as Reign Over Me, where he was a man who lost his family in the World Trade Centre attacks), that there is more to him than slapstick and fart jokes.</p><p>Early signs suggest the films unveiled in Toronto will enhance those complexities. In The Cobbler, Sandler plays a lonely shoe repairman who discovers that he can enter the lives of his customers via a magical heirloom – that he can know them by walking in their shoes. And in Men, Women &amp; Children, directed by Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air), he and Emma Thompson are part of an ensemble cast portraying people whose relationships are affected by the internet. The Sandler faithful might want to sit these ones out and wait for Grown Ups 3.</p><p>Sandler earned his stripes in the early 1990s on the evergreen US sketch show Saturday Night Live. The director Dennis Dugan wanted to cast him in Brain Donors, a 1992 comedy based on the Marx brothers' A Night at the Opera. \"I thought Adam was terrifically funny, interesting and personable,\" Dugan says. \"I brought him in for four auditions but I just couldn't get the producers to say yes.\" A few years later, Sandler remembered Dugan's persistence and hired him to direct Happy Gilmore. \"He's completely loyal. He'll even stay loyal to people who aren't as good team-mates as you'd like them to be. That's his personality.\"</p><p>Dugan has directed eight of Sandler's movies, including the gay-themed I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Just Go With It (co-starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman) and both Grown Ups pictures. But as far back as their initial collaboration, Dugan spotted an intriguing undercurrent in the star.</p><p>\"When we made Happy Gilmore I said to his agent and manager: 'He doesn't have to be just a goofball. He's got real heart and soul – he's a real actor. So we can go with the Pauly Shore version of this, or the Michael Keaton version.' They said they wanted the Michael Keaton version, and I did too.\"</p><p>Sandler became a one-man phenomenon; each hit outstripped the last. The Wedding Singer, in which he was a jilted groom performing 1980s pop hits and falling for Drew Barrymore, raked in $123m worldwide in 1998 and made a convincing case for him as a rom-com lead. In the same year, he was a nerd tormented by football players in The Waterboy ($190m). Both of those were eclipsed by his parenthood comedy Big Daddy, which grossed $228m the following year and still doesn't have the distinction of being his biggest hit – that would be Grown Ups ($272m), unless you count his voice work on the animated Hotel Transylvania ($359m).</p><p>The comic's pulling power has never been in doubt. But with Punch-Drunk Love, cast opposite the Oscar-nominated British actor Emily Watson, Sandler's acting skills were put to the test in some demented moments of warped romance. In one scene, the tentative lovers are exchanging whispered sweet nothings. Him: \"Your face is so beautiful, I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it.\" Her: \"I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful eyes with an ice-cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em.\"</p><p>The writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, who later made There Will Be Blood, felt rejuvenated by Sandler. \"I tried to make this simple little movie,\" he said. \"But sometimes simplicity can be so complicated. That's why it was good for Emily and me to work with Adam. He's so natural, he just shows up ready for work, whereas Emily and I tend to crawl up our own asses!</p><p>\"It's all about learning that whatever you did the first time was probably right. You don't have to do everything 50 times and then twist a corkscrew around it just to be sure.\"</p><p>Sandler's career didn't take a turn for the avant-garde after Anderson's movie but it's nice to think it let some fresh air into his persona, and allowed him to accept that he did not always have to be the guy with whom moviegoers would most like to share a pint.</p><p>Judd Apatow's 2008 Funny People, a study of the tormented personal lives of a group of fictional comedians, provided another example of how fine Sandler could be when he wasn't dispatching valentines to the audience. His character, an emotionally remote megastar, is diagnosed with a terminal illness but continues to use his celebrity for sex and power even after he recovers unexpectedly. Apatow and Sandler were room-mates early in their careers; it's possible that Funny People, with its radioactive anxiety about success, is the most personal film either man has made.</p><p>After every extracurricular challenge in other people's films, Sandler always snaps back into place in his ordinary Joe, blue-collar civvies. But the influence of Funny People was discernible in the part he wrote for himself in Grown Ups, where he played Lenny, a powerful agent concerned about the wedge that wealth had driven between him and his old school chums.</p><p>Lenny is careful to remove his snazzy sunglasses in front of his pals, and tries to conceal the fact that the young Asian woman in his party is in fact his children's au pair. In the climax, Lenny forgoes a sporting victory to allow a more downtrodden man a taste of triumph, which feels like Sandler's way of reassuring us that his own feet remain on the ground, even if that ground happens to be in Bel Air.</p><p>His ordinariness is the defining characteristic of his celebrity. Few modern stars have acquired such wealth and fame from pledging allegiance to the schlubby American everyman: sweatpants, corn dogs and all.</p><p>\"I don't feel he's changed,\" says Dugan. \"He's always been a really good guy. The press aren't nice to him – the reviews are crazy-cruel. But he doesn't care. All he wants to do is make people laugh and connect with the audience. He produces, he writes, he picks the music, he's in the editing room. He's a real film-maker – he's an artist.\"</p><p>Potted profile</p><p><strong>Born</strong> 9 September 1966, Brooklyn, New York City.</p><p><strong>Career</strong> After working the standup circuit, he landed a small acting role on The Cosby Show. In 1990, began a four-year stint on Saturday Night Live, launchpad for comedy superstars such as Tina Fey, Bill Murray, Kristen Wiig and Eddie Murphy.</p><p><strong>High point</strong> For him, the global success of Grown Ups. For the rest of us, his engagingly murky turns in Punch-Drunk Love and Funny People.</p><p><strong>Low point</strong> For a star whose worth is measured in box-office receipts, it must have mattered that his 2012 film That's My Boy flopped.</p><p><strong>What he says </strong>\"I know what [the critics] are writing about me. But then remember that I didn't get into movies to please the critics. I got into it to make people laugh and have fun with my friends.\" (2013)</p><p><strong>What they say </strong>\"What drives him is the desire to be funny and innovative. If there's something in the film he's making and he finds out there's a similar thing in another movie that just came out, he says, 'Go watch it. If we have to cut ours, we'll cut it.'
