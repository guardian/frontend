This phenomenon is caused by the scattering of sunlight by a cloud made of water droplets that are all roughly the same size, and is only produced when the light is just right. In order for a glory to be viewed, the observer’s anti-solar point must fall on the cloud deck below. In this case the observer is the Terra satellite, and the anti-solar point is where the sun is directly behind you – 180 degrees from the satellite's line of sight. Water and ice particles in the cloud bend the light, breaking it into all its wavelengths, and the result is colourful flare, which may contain all of the colours of the rainbow",

When water erodes rocks and carries them downstream or out to sea, softer minerals slowly erode away. Quartz – composed of clear or white silicon dioxide crystals, or silica – resists erosion longer than other rock types. So the brilliant sands around Jervis Bay owe their colour (or lack of it) to the relentless action of water from old rivers, and rising and falling seas over thousands of years. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the sands around Jervis Bay are the whitest in the world. These sands are also finer than typical ocean beach sand",
