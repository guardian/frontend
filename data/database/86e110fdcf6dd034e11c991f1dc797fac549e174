        "body":"<p>War loot is an ancient rite. It was seemingly an accepted fact of life – spoils to the victor. But when the spoils remain in the hands of the vanquished and were part of a vicious targeted genocide of an entire people, it takes on an entirely different dimension.</p><p></p><p>It is 68 years since the Nazis were defeated but only a little more than 20 years since the issue of war loot, and looted art in particular, became seriously addressed following the break up of the Soviet Union.</p><p></p><p>The discovery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police\" title=\"\">in Munich of a hoard of 1,500 looted art works</a> has itself taken a year and a half to come to light. Possibly the German authorities are embarrassed by such potent reminders of the actions of their predecessors.</p><p></p><p>Germany and its allies and collaborators amassed many thousands of objects of art by forced sale or confiscation. At the end of the war many were identified and, where possible, returned. But many were not.</p><p></p><p>In 1998, a conference was held in Washington where all the major western countries signed a protocol to investigate all objects in public hands whose provenance post-1933 was either dubious or absent, and to restitute to descendants where possible. Loot in private hands of course required different criteria depending on the possibility of purchases in good faith and the actual history of ownership.</p><p></p><p>Loot emerged not only in Germany and Austria but elsewhere, including the Netherlands, France and Britain well as in Russia where much is claimed as justified war loot from the Germans. Some countries and their public institutions engaged strongly with the Washington protocols. Others spoke loudly of their intentions, but at local levels, a lack of funding or staff was blamed for minimal efforts to identify problematic objects. Others effectively did nothing.</p><p></p><p>The appalling events of the Nazi era are still within living memory. Why has so little been done in so many countries to partially right these wrongs through restitution of looted objects? Is not the very enjoyment of stolen or looted objects obscene? Earlier this year, looted works of art were even found in German government offices.</p><p></p><p>The German museum and art community has largely failed to address these issues in sharp contrast to how the German government has addressed so many other legacies of the Nazi era. Maybe it is all too tangible. As stated when refusing to publish the Munich list online \"we do not want a situation where there are ten claims for one painting\".</p><p></p><p>It is at least possible that Bavaria in general and Munich in particular feel especially compromised when Nazi loot is found. But even within a federal system, the German government has a clear moral and ethical duty to ensure that justice is done and seen to be done.</p><p></p><p>For survivors of the Holocaust and their descendants any link with their broken past is precious. It is not a financial issue. Some objects will rise and others will fall over three generations. The overwhelming majority of restituted items are of little monetary value – they are a reminder of lost continuity, a family unit destroyed, the contents of a home brutally dismantled.</p><p></p><p>That is why descendants of the victims of the Nazi era care about restitution. Books with names written on the flyleaf. Candlesticks on the mantelpiece. Prints or paintings on lost walls. A link with a faded photo or an even more faded memory. A story repeated from those no longer able to tell.</p><p>The Commission for Looted Art in Europe is a non profit making body which assists claimants seeking restitution of objects forcibly sold or looted from their families.  Many such objects will sadly have no claimants.</p><p>Where objects can be identified it is the duty of each government and public body to face the issue and take immediate steps to publicise fully and to co-operate with those who seek some justice for crimes that cannot be adequately punished and thereby to bring some restoration to otherwise broken lives.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421722099|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|6e1ec94676adf19b3734e01d4fe4f4ffac0a27c2 -->",

        "body":"<p>I was cut when I was seven years old. Four women held me down. I felt every single cut. I was screaming so much I just blacked out. I didn't know what female genital mutilation (FGM) was until the day it happened to me. FGM is one of the worst physical and psychological scars a girl can be left with and I therefore completely endorse and welcome the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/04/uk-mutilation-girls-report\" title=\"\">new report</a> on tackling FGM.</p><p>The report, by a coalition of health professionals, stems from protecting the girl child and supporting the women who are affected by FGM. It reminds all frontline staff working with women and children that they are in the position of being able to prevent FGM. As a campaigner and survivor of FGM, if this report is endorsed and implemented in all departments including the Home Office and departments of health and education, I am truly confident that many girls in the UK will be saved  from this vile practice.</p><p>A key point of the report, <a href=\"http://www.rcog.org.uk/news/intercollegiate-group-draws-ground-breaking-recommendations-tackling-female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">Tackling Female Genital Mutilation in the UK</a>, launched on Monday in the House of Commons, is about holding frontline professionals accountable and empowering them to act to prevent this. Reporting abuse should not be an opt-in or opt-out matter. Also very important is implementing an awareness campaign; I believe FGM should be given the same publicity as HIV and knife crime. Historically there has been such a lack of urgency in confronting and tackling it – we seem to be closing our ears and pretending it's not happening.</p><p>The most important aspect of the report is to treat FGM as a safeguarding issue, as it is child abuse and needs to be stopped. One misconception is that it is similar to male circumcision. It's much more painful, it can lead to serious and sometimes life-threatening complications and there is no medical reason to do it. Another misconception is that it is something only practised by Muslims, but it has nothing to do with religion and isn't mentioned in any of the holy books or condoned by any religion.  It is happening to British girls and the numbers are staggering – in England and Wales, more than 24,000 girls are at risk and more than 66,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM. It is time we took a stand.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-421725622'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/5/1383670778076/Leyla-2.jpg' alt='FGM protest' width='220' height='330' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Home Office must take responsibility for drawing up and enforcing a national strategy and action plan to eliminate FGM in the UK, says Leyla Hussein</figcaption></figure><p>I have been heading up a campaign to ask the government to take charge and demanding we stop FGM in the UK for good. It has been filmed as part of a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-cruel-cut/episode-guide\" title=\"\">documentary for Channel 4</a>. During filming I looked at British attitudes to FGM and raising awareness among people in this country, as well as visiting practising communities and challenging them to look at why this is happening. My colleagues in Europe often say to me that Britain is a soft touch because their girls are being brought over to the UK to be cut. I think that's a clear sign that not enough is being done to tackle it. To me, cultural sensitivity is one of the biggest barriers to stopping FGM in Britain. One of the most powerful and disturbing parts of the filming for me was when, to demonstrate that we are walking on cultural eggshells in Britain, I took to the streets <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/what-happened-when-antifgm-campaigner-asked-people-in-the-street-to-sign-a-petition-in-favour-of-mutilating-girls-8908877.html\" title=\"\">asking people to sign a petition <em>in favour</em> of FGM</a>. I was shocked that in less than 30 minutes I got 19 signatures. The fact that people thought it was OK because it's someone's culture, was really scary.</p><p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation\" title=\"\">increased activities around FGM</a>, we're still failing to effectively stop this form of child abuse. We have multi-agency guidelines  that are not statutory and very little is practically being done at local level. Funding is minimal and no one is monitoring the situation or holding anyone to account, so let's push the Home Office to take responsibility for drawing up and enforcing a national strategy and action plan to eliminate FGM in the UK.</p><p>You could save a girl – and every signature counts. Please <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/52740\" title=\"\">sign my petition</a>.</p><p></p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-cruel-cut/episode-guide\" title=\"\">The Cruel Cut</a> is on Channel 4 on Wednesday 6 November at 10.45pm.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421717506|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|1b3eff3f80cc517a81bc5e2f7acb1aae0d8e9f80 -->",

Torontonians gathered around their news devices on a Sunday afternoon to hear Ford take the high road on talk radio – it was like a version of Brits waiting for Chamberlain to get back from Munich, except terribly stupid – and we learned several things.</p><p>\"<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-apologizes-for-mistakes-but-won-t-step-down-1.2335939\" title=\"\">I am not a rat</a>,\" the internationally ridiculed mayor said. \"I'm not an addict of any type of drug, even alcohol. I'm not an alcoholic.\"</p><p>Canadians don't do interventions. That's an American thing. But you see why we don't bother? A nice 81-year-old lady begged Ford on air to take a medical leave, and he patronised her infinitely. She wasn't talking about the lies or the criminal associates. She just meant the yelling and the way Ford collides with things on camera: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzI72WrOeA0 a football, http://blogs.shawconnect.ca/breaktime/rob-fords-football-follies-immortalized-in-gif-form/\" title=\"\">a weighing scale</a>, <a href=\"http://imgur.com/nATPNJb\" title=\"\">another camera</a>.</p><p>Then the mayor, who has been under surveillance for months by police in aeroplanes and cars and from cameras attached to poles, said he aims not to get \"hammered\" in public any more and agreed with his brother and fellow city councillor Doug Ford that it's best just to have a few \"pops\" in one's basement. The <a href=\" http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sandro-lisi-who-is-rob-ford-s-friend-and-driver-1.2304355\" title=\"\">photos of him meeting a man with a criminal history</a> – who has since been charged with extortion – in gas stations and parking lots, and his hundreds of phone conversations with that man? It didn't really come up.</p><p>Ford had no comment on the contents of the notorious video taken of him allegedly smoking crack with Somali-Canadian gang members (Dixon City Bloods) and making homophobic and racist slurs, a video that he had previously claimed didn't exist. All he asked was that the <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sandro-lisi-who-is-rob-ford-s-friend-and-driver-1.2304355\" title=\"\">police release the videos (plural) of him</a> – including the one that the city's police chief had said, with a sigh from the sonared depths, had made him feel \"disappointed\" – and he would continue to be the \"best mayor Toronto has ever had\".</p><p>He had only one request for the media: \"Don't stand on my driveway.\" I should say here that Ford sees the newspaper I work for, the Toronto Star, as his greatest enemy. Ford has called for a boycott of the Star, edited by a determined Brit named Michael Cooke, and will not speak to its reporters. The Star was taken to a <a href=\"http://ontpress.com/2013/10/16/opc-decision-donley-vs-toronto-star-october-2013/\" title=\"\">press complaints commission for its reporting and was entirely vindicated</a>.</p><p>Ford used that deadly piece of jargon, \"moving forward,\" dozens of times and so shall I. Toronto doesn't want your pity. (Actually, we do. We want a massively undeserved hug.) We want to make sure you don't repeat our mistakes.</p><p>First, do not artificially enlarge your city. A 1998 decision by the hard-right provincial government to amalgamate Toronto's downtown with its sprawling suburbs meant that voters had little in common with each other. If you vote out of spite, envy and revenge, this is the mayor you get.</p><p>Second, have a fast legal means of removing an elected official from office. Toronto does not have one. Ford does not have to depart until he is taken from a courtroom in handcuffs to jail.</p><p>Third, keep your police force independent of elected officials. Ford is going to decide the budget of the police force that has been investigating him for months, while weirdly failing to question him even once.</p><p>Fourth, if you're going to vote for a man who drinks, choose your candidate as carefully as you would the uncle you're having over for Christmas dinner. An affable drunk is always preferable to a habitually aggrieved one. No shoving! No throwing footballs indoors! No <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2013/11/01/rob_ford_very_intoxicated_at_city_hall_night_of_st_patricks_day_2012.html\" title=\"\">calling the cops to say your car's been stolen</a> because you can't find it!</p><p>Fifth ... oh, the hell with it. We're sorry about our sinister prime minister, Stephen Harper, not believing in global warming or indeed science. But Ford? We did it to ourselves. Have a hearty laugh at our expense.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421717175|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|4c8303e6436fcab34e1307d8eb2d5f3994615b4c -->",

        "headline":"The Employment Non-Discrimination Act is seriously flawed",
        "body":"<p>Caveat emptor: when it comes to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/battle-anti-gay-discrimination-senate\">Employment Non-Discrimination Act</a> (Enda), let the buyer beware. There's plenty of ballyhooing in the mainstream mostly <em>straight</em> press about what an<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57610788/employment-non-discrimination-act-enda-makes-progress-in-the-senate/\"> unmitigated success it is</a> for LGBT rights that the bill will be discussed in the US Senate this week. (It <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/dean-heller-enda-legislation-99309.html\">cleared a key test vote</a> Monday night, 61 to 30, with the support of every member of the Democratic caucus and some Republicans.) Even the Wall Street Journal, which has never been accused of being an organ for the liberal media, ran an <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/article_email/SB10001424052702304527504579172302377638002-lMyQjAxMTAzMDAwMjEwNDIyWj\">opinion piece</a> by Apple CEO Tim Cook on how equality benefits the workplace. But on closer inspection, neither Cook's support nor the Senate's is quite what it seems.</p><p>First, a quick primer on Enda, which has been languishing in Congress since 1994, despite the fact that even polls taken that year showed <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/11/04/what-is-the-employment-non-discrimination-act-enda/\">62% of Americans</a> support passage of laws to protect \"homosexuals\" from job discrimination. As Tico Almeida, president of the LGBT organization Freedom to Work, points out: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>One of our biggest Enda hurdles is the fact that <a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9716/polls-show-huge-public-support-for-gay-and-transgender-workplace-protections/\">90% of Americans</a> mistakenly believe Enda has already become law.</p></blockquote><p>But the fact is that as of now only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/may/08/gay-rights-united-states\">17 states and the District of Columbia</a> have statutes that protect against both sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in employment in public and private sectors. To put that another way, we're now living in a country where it's legal to marry your same-sex partner<a href=\"http://gaymarriage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004857\"> in 14 states</a> and enjoy federal benefits, but that you can still be fired for having your spouse's picture on your desk<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/may/08/gay-rights-united-states\"> in 33</a>.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why Enda has become a priority for the Senate now. These include the fact that there's little political risk in supporting LGBT civil rights in a post-don't ask don't tell and post-defense of marriage act America, but a great deal to gain from it. LGBT Americans were key to Democratic victories including the presidential election, in 2008 and 2012, as both voters and donors. Polls increasingly show that young voters of both parties overwhelmingly support full LGBT civil rights. In short, it's a winner and a wedge issue. It's also not going to pass. House majority leader John Boehner has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/04/john-boehner-enda_n_4212250.html\">made his opposition clear</a>.</p><p>And frankly, that may not be the worst possible scenario. Because there are real reasons to be less than thrilled with this particular version of Enda. Heather Cronk, <a href=\"http://getequal.org\">co-director of GetEQUAL</a>,  explained:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>In addition to the exemptions included in other civil rights legislation, Enda goes far beyond them to offer 'religious immunity' to religiously affiliated institutions like schools, hospitals, and universities. So the passage of Enda would mean that, though it is illegal for a Baptist university to discriminate against a female professor or for a Catholic hospital to discriminate against a Jewish janitor, discrimination against LGBT folks is completely OK.</p></blockquote><p>Dorothy Samuels of the <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/an-unholy-religious-exemption/?_r=0\">New York Times adds</a>: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Does anyone really think there should be a religious defense to firing a transgender doctor when a private hospital merges with one affiliated with a religious group?</p></blockquote><p>If President Obama is as committed to ending discrimination in the workplace as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barack-obama/enda-congress_b_4209115.html\">he purports to be</a>, there's plenty more he can do – all on his own, without Congress, and while knowing that he has the support of the majority of the American public. He could pick up a pen and sign the executive order<a href=\"http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/04/white-house-no-federal-contractor-nondiscriminatio.html\"> he's refused to sign since April 2011</a>, despite a 2008 campaign promise. It would ban federal contractors from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation or gender identity, thereby protecting approximately 26 million people, or nearly 22% of the total civilian workforce. </p><p>Of course, Democrats aren't the only ones using Enda to polish their own apple. Apple's Wall Street Journal op-ed also exhibits a certain amount of sound and fury – just ahead of the release of the Human Rights Campaign's release of their annual report on which American corporations have the best record on protecting LGBT employees. Also at a time when Apple and other Olympic sponsors are under heavy pressure to take a stand against<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/russia-war-on-gays-sochi-olympics\"> LGBT discrimination in Russia</a> ahead of the 2014 Sochi games. </p><p>Strangely enough for a corporation that's so proud of its non-discrimination policies, I needed to turn to Apple's press people to find where it appears —<br />buried deep within their site in their Business Conduct Policy document. There, said policy is briefly mentioned in one short paragraph on page 5, under \"Harassment and Discrimination\" alongside every other protected category. When I asked whether Apple's western non-discrimination policies hold true for its employees and customers in Russia, I received a short, terse answer that the policies applied everywhere. Despite asking twice for a link to where the policy appears in Russian on the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ru/legal/\">Russian site</a>, I received none. My Russian-speaking friends also searched the site for a mention of the policy, unsuccessfully. </p><p>So while Obama is signing the executive order, my friend Nina Long, <a href=\"http://rusalgbt.com\">co-president of RUSA-LGBT</a> has a suggestion for Apple's Tim Cook that would fit neatly into their current marketing campaign. That neat engraving feature for Apple products? \"Tell them to put default engraving for Russian Exports that reads, 'Designed by LGBT-friendly Apple in California.'\"</p><p>• This article was amended on 5 November 2013 to correct that John Boehner is House majority leader.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421719774|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|ed1d86cf8a014101991472bedcdb872a4bfab072 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/03f754da-455b-11e3-b98b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2jgXSlSDK\" title=\"\">A tech giant rises – another falls</a>,\" said the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/397501470087847936/photo/1\" title=\"\">front-page headline</a> on the Financial Times. It juxtaposed Twitter's initial public offering (IPO), which is set to raise more from the market than Google did in 2004, with the chaotic events at BlackBerry, which <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/11/04/blackberry-abandons-fairfax-deal-heins-out/\" title=\"\">dropped a plan to sell itself for $4.7bn</a>, jettisoned its chief executive and <a href=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/11/04/blackberry-investors-disapprove-of-debt-deal/\" title=\"\">said it would raise $1bn in cheap debt</a>.</p><p>Is that how it goes? Is the technology business a sort of one-in, one-out game? It's certainly hard to find a company with more enthusiastic investors ahead of the bell than Twitter – though let's see how things go once the shares are traded – nor one that has been more heftily dumped than BlackBerry, which in June 2008 boasted shares topping $144. Now they languish at $6.50.</p><p>Or did BlackBerry just get too old? Is that it?</p><p>Actually, no. The difference between technology companies (and companies generally) that survive and those that don't is much simpler. As with biological species, it's all about adaptability. If you can't adapt, then you will be erased by history.</p><p>The obvious example is Apple, which in 1997 was just 90 days from bankruptcy. Steve Jobs, older and wiser than when he had been fired from it, came back, used his industry connections (particularly Bill Gates) to get the company stable and began building the company back up. The iPod, originally conceived as a device to make people buy more Macintosh computers, instead turned into a huge product line in itself.</p><p>But by 2005, Jobs recognised that making iPods wouldn't be enough: modern phones would soon be able to store just as much music as a cheap iPod, and make phone calls too. So he set Apple's designers and engineers to making a phone.</p><p>If Apple hadn't shifted from making iPods to iPhones – what startup companies call a \"pivot\", meaning a shift in business focus – then it would have been erased: the Mac and iPod business together generated about $6bn in Apple's most recent quarter, less than half that of Google, and one-third that of Microsoft.</p><p>The iPhone seems obvious and its success assured now – but as recounted in <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007448401&amp;guni=Article:in%20body%20link\" title=\"\">Fred Vogelstein's forthcoming book Dogfight</a>, it was actually a tightrope walk involving barely ready prototypes, buggy software and last-minute deals. When Jobs showed off the iPhone in January 2007, there wasn't an assembly line for them, and Jobs's demos had to be carefully planned to avoid embarrassing crashes using a \"golden path\" worked out laboriously by testers.</p><p>Ditto for the iPad: even internal testers were unsure what it was \"for\", Vogelstein records. (In that, they sound much like the collective \"huh?\" that emanated from many who first saw it.) Now the iPad generates more money than Microsoft's entire Windows business.</p><p>So success isn't foretold in the technology business. Nor was BlackBerry's demise. True, it had a lead, but a <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/coming-saturday-the-inside-story-of-why-blackberry-is-failing/article14563602/\" title=\"\">detailed analysis by Canada's Globe and Mail of the failure of the nation's darling</a> shows that its managers discussed different ways to get out of their predicament time and again. The problem wasn't that they didn't have ideas; it was that they made the wrong choices. They didn't fail to adapt; they failed to make the correct adaptations.</p><p>You can see this happening elsewhere. Microsoft, which used to be just a software licensing company, began making hardware with the Xbox (sure, keyboards were first, but not relevant) and now is building its own Surface tablets, and will soon own Nokia's handset business. It'll be a software-writing, tablet-making, phone-building company – just like Apple. Google too now owns a phone manufacturer (Motorola) and is building new hardware (its Glass device). Even being a big and hugely profitable company doesn't mean you don't have to adapt.</p><p>So while it might seem as though BlackBerry's time simply came and went, the truth is – if we only had time machines, and a desire to save it – that there were always times when it could have been saved from this agonising swirl around the black hole of irrelevance. And Twitter, too, will meet some point when it abruptly faces a choice that will either kill it, or make it stronger. Every company does; and many choose wrongly. That's why most companies go bust in their first five years. Surviving beyond that (as Twitter, Facebook and many others have done) doesn't exempt you from having to adapt.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421714190|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|143c0b2f21eaef15c3bb0f46ede89a770da4d740 -->",

        "headline":"Rising homelessness in Paris: does it have the most rough sleepers of the big European capitals?",
        "body":"<p>At 9pm, as the street lights glinted off the river Seine beyond Notre Dame cathedral, by the Pont Marie bridge, Yan, 37, was neatly laying out his cardboard boxes for the night in front of a chic sofa-bed shop. A dozen people were already climbing into sleeping bags nearby, an elderly woman was sorting clothes, a man in his 60s was wrapped in a duvet reading a book as the last well-heeled commuters hurried past from the metro. Yan, a Polish butcher, trained in charcuterie, just wanted a job in his trade. \"But you can't work with food while you're sleeping rough, it just wouldn't feel hygienic …\" he muttered. He had been sleeping rough in Paris for three years, occasionally doing agricultural work outside the city. With the weather not yet plunging to freezing, he felt OK inside two sleeping bags on a bed of cardboard on the concrete. \"When it gets colder, we'll go down into underground car parks to sleep. Not the metro, because, with the constant noise and activity, you can't get to sleep before 1am, then you're up again at five. Here, I'll shut my eyes at 10 or 11pm, I'll be gone by seven.\"</p><p>Beside him, Igor, 50, an unemployed Slovakian painter and decorator, remembered sleeping in offices he once worked on. Now he too just wants a job. Do the police bother them? \"No, they just patrol at around midnight, have a quick look to check we're all alive.\"</p><p>At the Socialist-run Paris city hall nearby, where election fever is hotting up before next spring, some would argue it's better to be poor in Paris than a lot of other places, saying levels of social aid in the capital are high. But, years after French presidential candidates of both left and right (the Socialist Lionel Jospin, then the rightwing Nicolas Sarkozy) promised that no more people would ever need to sleep rough, the number on cardboard boxes in the street is rising. Campaigners warn that successive French governments have failed to solve not only homelessness but a wider housing crisis. With no clear regular statistics collected, it's impossible to prove what some Parisians believe on their early morning commute past sleeping bags in sandpits in children's parks, mattresses in doorways, sometimes women and children on the pavements: that there are more people sleeping rough in their city than other big European capitals. The French national statistics office warned of <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/07/02/le-nombre-de-sdf-a-augmente-de-50-depuis-2001_915267\" title=\"\">a 50% increase in homelessness in France from 2001 to 2012</a>, including a rise in foreigners and women. They calculated 141,500 homeless across France at the start of last year, but charities add hundreds of thousands more at risk and in precarious housing situations.</p><p>There's a centuries-long history of people being down and out in Paris, a city with a tradition of transient populations and now more European migrants, said Julien Damon, a sociologist at Sciences Po university. \"Paris is seen as an extremely tolerant city and generous in its offer of aid and social protection. It's perhaps the EU city that spends most in terms of public policy on shelter and these issues.\" He said homelessness was less stigmatised in France. \"In London you can't sleep in a tent and stay in the same place all day. In Paris, you can. There's no criminalisation of begging.\" But if Paris homelessness is perhaps tolerated more than in London and Berlin, that did not mean the problem was being solved by successive governments.</p><p>Polls show that French people are sympathetic to the homeless. In European surveys, the French are the nationality most likely to view homelessness as the unfortunate result of financial crisis, unemployment and housing crises and the least likely to blame the individual for personal reasons such as drugs or alcohol. A <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/11/19/01011-20091119FILWWW00586-56-des-francais-ont-peur-d-etre-sdf.php\" title=\"\">2009 poll</a> found that a staggering 56% of French people felt they could one day be homeless themselves, 75% felt \"solidarity\" with rough sleepers.</p><p>The past decade has seen successive protests, such as organised tent cities, in Paris to highlight the plight of the homeless.</p><p>Others make their own gestures. Joël Catherin, a young lawyer who began writing quirky cardboard signs for the homeless people in his posh Paris neighbourhood, in turn inspired <a href=\"http://www.rezinaprod.com/grand-mere.htm\" title=\"\">a short film by Bernard Tanguy</a>. In his flat, Catherin showed me boxes full of hundreds of tattered cardboard signs he had drawn. In Paris, the felt-tipped signs reading \"I'm hungry\" beside a paper cup for coins are a regular fixture for people sitting on street corners. Catherin had noticed an elderly Romanian woman, Ioana, sleeping rough in his neighbourhood near the Madeleine district with a similar sign. One winter night, angered by the cold and the homelessness problem, he made her a new sign: \"I could be your grandmother.\" It worked, money fell into the pot, people started noticing. He was soon drawing up signs for other homeless people he befriended – comments on politics, football, jokes. From a reference to the FT magazine, \"How to Spend it?\" to \"Sale, end of line\", \"All we need is love, 1 euro\". Locals, social media and the French press began searching out <a href=\"http://www.rue89.com/2011/04/10/joel-avocat-des-riches-qui-invente-des-pancartes-pour-sdf-198817\" title=\"\">these mysterious, odd and unsettling subtitles of the cityscape</a>.</p><p>\"Humans don't need subtitles,\" Catherin said. \"It's more that, through the words on the cardboard, passersby looked at these people differently and realised they were human beings. It wasn't about money, it was about changing the way people view others.\"</p><p>\"Sometimes it felt as if these homeless people were like human furniture. People passed them while putting their bottles in the bottle-bank for recycling, but didn't think of them as human,\" he said. The thing about the now infamous sign, 'I could be your grandmother', he felt, was that \"it made people go and speak to her, show some sympathy. It became part of our neighbourhood.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421707174|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|10f3c8654b15d884c4ee23db2457befe65138299 -->",

        "headline":"Where's the outrage about the monarchy's extravagant expenses?",
        "body":"<p>There's quite a view from the chamber in City Hall where the London assembly meets to scrutinise the mayor. Occasionally during one of Boris Johnson's more vague and waffling answers at mayor's question time, my eyes wander to admire the fine vista of the north side of the Thames, and come to rest upon one of London's most ancient buildings – the Tower of London.</p><p>The tower was, of course, the place where enemies of the monarch were once imprisoned. Judging from the reaction from some sections of the media to a <a href=\"http://tomcopley.com/spare-sycophancy/\" title=\"\">short blog post I wrote</a> bemoaning the reaction of some politicians to the royal christening, there are some who'd like the tower to be bought back into use for this very purpose.</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/london-assembly-attacks-mps-for-fawning-royal-baby-tributes-8915177.html\" title=\"\">originally ran</a> in the Evening Standard. Unsurprisingly, it caused the Daily Mail to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2481513/Tributes-Prince-George-stomach-churning-says-Labours-Tom-Copley.html\" title=\"\">froth over with faux-outrage</a>. Conservative MP Bob Neill accused me of being \"out of touch\", proving once again that no one fawns over royalty quite like a Tory. Still, it's nice to see Neill standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves. The Huffington Post <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/11/01/prince-george-labour_n_4189456.html?1383304808&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk\" title=\"\">ran the story</a> as the main headline on its front page, asking readers if they agreed with me.</p><p>The media reaction demonstrates once again how monarchy infantilises us by creating a semi-mystical institution that is supposedly above criticism. The expectation is that we should suspend our critical faculties, nod, smile and say how bloody marvellous the whole thing is. No thanks. Opinion polling consistently shows that 20-25% of the British people want a democratic alternative to hereditary monarchy. That's millions of people who deserve to have their voices heard.</p><p>The Queen is quite understandably held in high public affection. But that does not mean that we should not debate the serious constitutional issue of whether it is right that in the 21st century we continue to select our head of state by accident of birth rather than by universal suffrage. This is not some minor issue. Through royal prerogative, powers are exercised by the prime minister on behalf of the monarch with absolutely no oversight or scrutiny from parliament. Perhaps the most insidious of these is the ability it gives a prime minister to pack the unelected House of Lords with his stooges, a practice that has always gone on but which has been taken <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/18/unthinkable-lords-chosen-by-lot\" title=\"\">to new extremes by David Cameron</a>.</p><p>The royal family is granted absolute protection from public scrutiny in a manner that would put the Daily Mail into apoplexy if it were any other part of the public sector. Most egregiously, the royal family is entirely exempted from Freedom of Information requests. It is well known that Prince Charles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/12/prince-charles-lobbying-david-cameron\" title=\"\">uses his position to lobby ministers</a>, in particular when it comes to his pet issues of architecture and homeopathic medicine. Yet ministers have vetoed all attempts to bring correspondence between Charles and ministers to light. This is hardly transparent government.</p><p>Members of parliament were quite rightly lambasted in the media when details of abuses of expenses were revealed. Yet we don't hear a peep from the Daily Mail about extravagant royal expenses. To quote Ian Davidson MP, a former member of the public accounts committee, \"every time we examined royal finances we found extravagance and indulgence as well as abuse of expenses by junior royals\".</p><p>Some people thought that my comments about the royal christening were somewhat churlish. So let me put this into context. I represent a city in which 650,000 children live in poverty, where 391,000 children live in overcrowded housing and 17,000 live in severely overcrowded housing. In the sixth richest city in the world these numbers should shame us all. You'll have to forgive me for being angry that valuable parliamentary time was spent paying tribute to the christening of a very rich, wealthy baby.</p><p>When mild criticism of our hereditary monarchy provokes such a storm in the media, it's no wonder that politicians tend to avoid straying into the debate. But we shouldn't be cowed. On Saturday I spoke at the <a href=\"http://www.republic.org.uk/updates/?event=republic-members-day-and-agm-2013\" title=\"\">annual general meeting of Republic</a>, the organisation that campaigns for an elected head of state, where we also heard from other European republican movements. The Swedish movement boasts three MPs from three different parties on its management committee, something that I would hope to see replicated in this country in the near future. Republicans everywhere should speak up, be proud of what we believe in and work together to win the argument for a democratic alternative to monarchy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421693592|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|1d9eecfe245c919750b1653f6014992408444486 -->",

        "body":"<p>Is President Obama a suspected war criminal?</p><p>If you have read the recent reports on drone strikes by <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/BenEmmerson.aspx\">Ben Emmerson, UN special rapporteur</a> on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/executions/pages/srexecutionsindex.aspx\">Christof Heyns, UN special rapporteur</a> on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/amnesty-us-officials-war-crimes-drones\">Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch</a>, there is only one answer to this question … and it is not the answer most would want to hear. </p><p>If you have not read the reports, let me provide you with a brief summary of the common themes. The reports repeatedly criticized President Obama for what has been a near complete lack of transparency. Lack of transparency, according to the reports, impedes accountability. By failing to acknowledge responsibility for drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, there can be no accountability to those who have wrongfully had their innocent loved ones killed in attacks.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx\">Frank La Rue, special rapporteur</a> on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, noted the role the right to information plays in promoting good governance. La Rue added that there exists a right to know the truth because the truth enables access to other rights: in this case, the right to reparations and accountability for the wrongful deaths of loved ones.</p><p>Connecting the issue of transparency to accountability under the law, Heyns stated:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>A lack of appropriate transparency and accountability concerning the deployment of drones undermines the rule of law and may threaten international security. Accountability for violations of international human rights law (or international humanitarian law) is not a matter of choice or policy; it is a duty under domestic and international law.</p></blockquote><p>This brings us to the question of whether President Obama's targeted killing program, implemented through the use of drone strikes, complies with both international human rights law and international humanitarian law. <em>Outside of a defined conflict zone</em>, international human rights law is the applicable law. This is important because human rights law demands significantly more stringent rules for the use of lethal force than does humanitarian law.</p><p>If the United States is only involved in an armed conflict in Afghanistan, international human rights law would be the regime that regulates the use of lethal force in Pakistan and Yemen. Therefore, as noted by Amnesty International, the use of lethal force outside of Afghanistan is legal when it can be demonstrated that:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[It was] only used when strictly unavoidable to protect life, no less harmful means such as capture or non-lethal incapacitation was possible, and the use of force was proportionate in the prevailing circumstances.</p></blockquote><p>Amnesty International concluded that it is highly likely that drone strikes in Pakistan fail to \"satisfy the law enforcement standards that govern intentional use of lethal force outside armed conflict\", and therefore:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>[T]heir deliberate killings by drones … very likely violate the prohibition of arbitrary deprivation of life and may constitute extrajudicial executions.</p></blockquote><p>If we accept the argument made by the Obama administration and the Bush administration before it – that the United States is involved in an armed conflict with al-Qaida and associated forces wherever they are engaged – international humanitarian law is the <em>lex specialis</em> in Pakistan and Yemen. Yet, even with less rigorous limitations on the use of lethal force under international humanitarian law, there is mounting evidence that the Obama administration's use of drones constitute violations of international law in the form of war crimes.</p><p>Human Rights Watch examined six strikes in Yemen. <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/10/22/between-drone-and-al-qaeda-0\">According to its report</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Two of these attacks were in clear violation of international humanitarian law – the laws of war – because they struck only civilians or used indiscriminate weapons. The other four cases may have violated the laws of war because the individual attacked was not a lawful military target or the attack caused disproportionate civilian harm.</p></blockquote><p>Going beyond the examination of individual strikes, President Obama has utilized tactics that inherently violate the laws of war. These include the use of so-called \"signature strikes\" and \"double taps\". According to Amnesty International:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Under international humanitarian law, US drone operators must at all times abide by the principle of distinction; namely distinguish between civilians and combatants … All feasible precautions must be taken in determining whether a person is a civilian … In case of doubt, the person must be presumed to be protected against direct attack.</p></blockquote><p>Signature strikes target individuals for death based not on the confirmed identity or activities of the targets, but rather \"behavioral characteristics\" identified as those typical of militants. This is a clear violation of the principle of distinction. Further, Amnesty International questions President Obama's assertion that drone strikes are only launched when there is \"near certainty\" that civilians will not be killed in the strike – a likely reference to President Obama's disputed method of counting \"all military-age males\" in the vicinity of an alleged target as militants.</p><p>Amnesty International argues that the president's precautionary measures \"are only relevant if the US applies the status of 'civilian' to unidentified individuals, rather than presuming they are combatants whom they deem directly targetable. Otherwise, these killings could constitute war crimes or extrajudicial executions.\"</p><p>The \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan\">double tap</a>\" involves launching an initial drone strike, which is followed by a second strike that targets rescuers and first responders. The rationale behind the use of double taps is that those who converge on the scene of the initial strike must be militants themselves.</p><p>Thus, the use of double taps relies on two assumptions. The first is that the victims of the initial strike were militants – an assumption the facts simply do not corroborate in numerous cases. And the second assumption, which is that first responders must also be militants, fails because of the failure of the first. Further, even if the victims of the initial strike were legitimate targets, to assume those who converge on the scene of the initial strike to be military targets clearly fails to satisfy the principle of distinction.</p><p>Once again, the United States stands at a crossroad. Either it can immunize President Obama and members of his administration from accountability, as it did President Bush and his administration. As seen, this route exposes the hypocrisy of the administration's counter-terrorism policy to full display. Or the US can subject its leaders to the same standards it demands of others.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421636902|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|884a52913ca12ed5f5642fc004037b267e7d83d4 -->",

        "body":"<p>As Americans in Virginia and New Jersey head to the polls to vote for a governor Tuesday, one has to wonder what will make them mark their ballots for their preferred candidates. One thing is certain: a politician doesn't need to run on substance these days; soundbites will get the job done. If politicians want to curry favor with their base, they should take a leaf from the playbook of Representative Joe Wilson, who interrupted President Obama during a 2009 speech to Congress, shouting, \"You lie!\"</p><p>Decorum? No. Worldwide attention? Yes.</p><p>In New Jersey, a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 700,000 among registered voters, incumbent Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who leads in the polls by a wide margin, spent the last weekend of the campaign touring the state encountering crowds that \"treated him more like a celebrity than a politician\", according to the New York Times. What about his opponent? The Democratic challenger is Senator Barbara Buono; yet it's almost as if she doesn't exist. She needs some soundbites that could be turned into Twitter hashtags.</p><p>Are voters picking winners based on outsize personalities, rather than the substantial issues of the day, such as unemployment? Governor Christie is, both literally and figuratively, an outsized candidate who takes positions that would appear to be to the right of New Jersey's voters. Yet, where does his public personality in the media leave his opponent? In the dust, apparently.</p><p>The middle class in New Jersey has taken a hammering economically, but Christie is hailed as a strong possible presidential candidate for 2016.</p><p>We shouldn't be surprised at larger-than-life, media-savvy candidates being elected to office, as we have only to look at the rise of Corey Booker, the new Democratic Senator for New Jersey and former mayor of Newark. Again, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/nyregion/booker-wins-senate-race-in-new-jersey.html?_r=0\">from the New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With a Twitter following six times as large as the city he has led, Mr Booker was known outside Newark largely for his appearances on late-night television and his heroics: rescuing a neighbor from a burning building, shoveling out snowbound cars, living on a food stamp diet.</p></blockquote><p>There was something about a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2432826/Cory-Booker-exchanges-flirtatious-messages-Portland-stripper-Twitter.html\">Twitter relationship with a vegan stripper from my hometown of Portland</a>, Oregon, but I'll let that slide. Although Booker oversaw budget cuts that reduced the size of the Newark police force, which his critics pointed to as a factor in a two-week spree of murders this summer, even Tea Party favorites Rand Paul and Sarah Palin couldn't help his Republican opponent, Steve Lonegan (remember him?), cast a shadow on Booker's media spotlight.</p><p>In Virginia, Democrat Terry McAuliffe is in a tough race for the state's governorship. McAuliffe is a rough-and-tumble political combatant revered for his fundraising abilities. In fact, he is known in Democratic circles as a \"super-funder\". He raised a $34.4m campaign war chest; his Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli, raised $19.7m.</p><p>McAuliffe is pals with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and President Obama took to the stump on Sunday to support him. How many watts of star-power does this man need? What will he bring to the state if he gets elected – sleepovers in the governor's mansion?</p><p>The campaign has been rife with negative advertising, mostly from the Democratic side. Cuccinelli is running against Obamacare, while relying on his Tea Party base and the NRA. That's about it on the substance of issues at hand. While McAuliffe has found support from Republican business leaders who expect him to improve the state's business climate, we haven't heard a lot about the Virginia company he ran, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GreenTech_Automotive\">GreenTech</a>.</p><p>Politicking is as old as the hills. What's new is the plethora of media channels: Facebook, Twitter, blogs, cable \"news\" channels and an odd preponderance of journalists who don't ask tough questions of candidates. In an era of soundbites and rapid-fire tweeting, society stands to lose if we are not electing officials to office based on their true, substantive plans for how they will govern and represent the electorate that votes them in. </p><p>In the meantime, we can <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-i-m-not-an-alcoholic-i-m-not-a-drug-addict-1.2355543\">look to Toronto's scandal-struck mayor, Rob Ford,</a> to see what substantive plans he brought to that city, and we can discuss whether Michelle Obama should be wearing stiletto heels or flats. It's enough to make one nostalgic for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_(paper)\">the hanging chad</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421656048|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|a702cd1c1f6c114f95fa1e9d66563eec7d20fa51 -->",

Our national self-image centres on a uniquely <a href=\"http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10571\">classless society</a>, unencumbered by the stratification and snobbery of the Old World. Acknowledging that divisions exist and that we do not in fact inhabit a <a href=\"http://tarahunt.com/2013/10/28/meritocracy-is-almost-as-real-as-this-unicorn/\">unicorn-filled meritocracy</a> is impossible within this framework. For those who wish to maintain the comforting fiction of a nation where Jack is as good as his master, the resulting sense of denial creates strange outcomes. As Guy Rundle <a href=\"http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/11/01/rundle-rupert-clive-and-campbell-in-the-arkansas-of-the-world/?wpmp_switcher=mobile\">noted</a> recently, Australia is a topsy-turvy place where &ldquo;billionaires lecture us about elitism&rdquo;.</p> <p>We have a class-shaped gap in much of our national conversation, and this void is filled by coded, euphemistic language, including <a href=\"http://thingsboganslike.com/\">mockery</a> of &ldquo;bogans&rdquo; and, relevantly, the lamentation that young women attending a horse race fail to conform to dress codes. Thus we have &ldquo;leading stylist and Westfield ambassador Donny Gallela&rdquo; advising:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When dressing for the races, women should dress like a lady and adhere to basic racing style rules such as not flashing too much flesh and always wearing headwear.</p> </blockquote> <p>This, we are repeatedly <a href=\"http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/article/-/19485760/melbourne-cup-carnival-2013-race-day-fashion-explained/\">told</a>, is the point of the Cup for women: it gives us a chance to &ldquo;dress like a real lady&rdquo;.&nbsp;We are attuned to sexism, but classism also lurks in this sort of advice. The term &ldquo;lady&rdquo; is used to denote a division between different types of women (recall also that class is inextricably linked to race), and it circulates in modern times despite the equivalent descriptor &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; (to separate male plebs from their betters) having largely fallen into disuse.</p> <p>Consider the UK-produced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladette_to_Lady\">Ladette to Lady</a> television show that appeared during the 2000s, teaching boisterous young women to enunciate their vowels, dress demurely, and sublimate their personalities. For added colonial cringe, there were <a href=\"http://www.lifestyle.com.au/tv/aussie-ladette-to-lady/\">versions</a> of the show featuring all Australian contestants. A century after George Bernard Shaw wrote Pygmalion, the urge to remould young Eliza Doolittles has not yet evaporated.</p> <p>In 2013, it is no longer acceptable publicly to fulminate about the failings of the <br />&ldquo;lower orders&rdquo;, but this sentiment has not disappeared: could it lie beneath the horror expressed each November at the spectre of fake-tanned, miniskirted young women?</p> <p>Parallels may be drawn with the phenomena English writer Owen Jones interrogated in his 2011 polemic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Classes</a>; the author argued that hostility towards an &ldquo;underclass&rdquo; represented in caricatures such as Little Britain&rsquo;s Vicky Pollard masked contempt for the working classes (a term rarely used in Australia&rsquo;s mainstream media, except when politicians <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Costello-taxes-the-point-were-all-working-class/2005/05/16/1116095909038.html\">claim membership</a>). For Jones, demonization was &ldquo;the ideological backbone of an unequal society&rdquo;.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s return to the Cup and the scandalised commentary surrounding its dress codes, which raises some questions. What does a lady look like? Who determines what behaviour is deemed ladylike? Is a lady simply a woman who conforms to antiquated assumptions rooted in a moribund yet strangely durable English class system?</p> <p>To ask these kinds of questions in the context of the Melbourne Cup is not to romanticise binge-drinking, which poses a danger to both men and women (although enthusiastic boozing attracts less concern when embraced by the male of the species). Neither is fashionably scanty clothing, at the races or otherwise, necessarily a symbol of empowerment; it&rsquo;s as well to be sceptical of versions of feminism that coincide with the dictates of consumer capitalism. It is simply to suggest that lamentations about the failure of young women to act &ldquo;like ladies&rdquo; need to be read with a critical eye.</p> <p>One thing is more or less certain: the day after the Cup, the papers will be replete with gleefully prurient pictures of bedraggled young women carrying their shoes. Our leaves don't fall in dramatic fashion, we don't have many snow storms, but here in this wide brown land the seasonal cycle continues.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421659057|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|130db108bf12472085a97d2523b35d750b0748e1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Something awful happened to me last week while I was playing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/22/grand-theft-auto-5-review\" title=\"\">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> (GTA). As usual, I was hijacking a car; either because I wanted to escape the police or because my other car was parked about 50ft away and I couldn't be bothered to walk over to it. It doesn't matter which.</p><p>However, this time the driver happened to be an old lady. A sweet old lady who pleaded with me not to hurt her as I pulled her frail body from her seat. That car was probably the only thing that still allowed her some degree of independence, I realised. The insurance company would probably dick her around, too. It might take her months to get the car replaced. And that's if she even had the confidence to return to the wheel at all, which she probably wouldn't.</p><p>Robbing the old lady, even though I knew she was just a lump of pixels, made me feel terrible. What sort of monster had I become? Appalled at myself, I gave her the car back and let her drive away in it.</p><p>I am rubbish at GTA 5. I think I'm just a bit too Guardian for it.</p><p>There have been other instances of this. I've only ever robbed one shop, and that was only when the game made me. I won't do it willingly due to a misguided belief that you should support the local businessman. I routinely get shot dead on missions because I don't like the idea of topping up my health meter with sugary snacks made from processed foods. I'm barely even skimming what the game has to offer, and it's all because I'm a woolly, liberal, cartoon joke.</p><p>This sounds like comic exaggeration, but I promise it isn't. If the game controller's R3 button allowed you to leave an apologetic note on the windscreen of the car you've just accidentally bumped into, then that's how I'd spend 95% of my time.</p><p>It wasn't always this way. When the first top-down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/18/dan-houser-grand-theft-auto\" title=\"\">GTA game was released in 1997</a>, I was as recklessly immoral as they come. Back then I'd quite happily flamethrower a line of dancing Hare Krishnas for a giggle. But now that I've grown up into a hand-wringing, left-leaning ninny I've found myself trying to play the game as responsibly as I can. Like someone's mum would.</p><p>Playing GTA Online only makes this worse. The story mode makes you do a number of terrible things but that's fine because you're controlling a fictional character. But online, when I'm controlling a character who looks like me – albeit a skinnier, more attractive version of me – everything changes. For want of a better word, playing GTA Online turns me into a yellowbellied nancypants.</p><p>I'm pretty sure I'm alone in being crippled by this sense of social responsibility, too. When you play GTA Online, you can hear everyone else, and in my experience all the other players are either rapping six-year-old French arsonists or middle-aged men who only stop trying to murder me as gratuitously as possible in order to shout swearwords at their newborn babies.</p><p>And yet, despite all this, I'll keep playing. Because the beauty of GTA is that it's set in such a perfectly realised world that nobody ever has to compromise their ideals if they don't want to. There are plenty of other things to do within the game. So let's hear it for GTA 5: the most expensive biking around a mountaintop while listening to Eddie Murphy simulator that there has ever been.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421629670|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|1adf76799f8e46b0638b99940f43aa4fdf49b1fa -->",

        "headline":"Indonesia-Australia spying row: welcome to full-contact diplomacy",
        "body":"<p>Welcome to the world of full-contact diplomacy. Indonesian foreign minister Marty Natelagawa’s warnings that Indonesia will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/spying-row-indonesia-threatens-to-stop-co-operating-on-people-smuggling\">review its intelligence co-operation </a>with Australia and the United States unless they provide assurances they won’t spy on Indonesia shouldn’t be over-interpreted; they’re part of the rough-and-tumble world of diplomacy. And before we diagnose a crisis in Indonesia-Australia relations, we need to take a closer look at what’s going on.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/nsa-australia-bali-conference-spy-indonesia\">revelations</a> about the collection of signals intelligence at Australian missions in regional capitals are the work of an American whistleblower and Australian journalists, not neighbouring governments. If foreign governments are genuinely surprised and shocked that the US and Australia spy on them, they are naive in the extreme. Stealing secrets has been a part of statecraft since time immemorial, and arguably makes the world a safer place by minimising the chances that governments will surprise each other. Amidst all the outrage in Germany that the NSA has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/23/us-monitored-angela-merkel-german\">tapping Angela Merkel’s private mobile phone</a>, someone should be asking some hard questions about why her phone hasn’t been encrypted from the start. If the Americans weren’t tapping the German chancellor’s unsecured phone conversations, the Russians, Chinese and French would be.</p> <p>In reality, Jakarta is well aware that Australia is part of the most potent eavesdropping partnership in the world. Indonesia has been a beneficiary of Australia’s intelligence capabilities in its fight against terrorism, just as Australia has benefited from intelligence cooperation with Jakarta. Against this background, Natelagawa’s threatened “review” takes on a Yes Minister slant – something that’s done in order to look decisive, while leaving things pretty much as they are.</p> <p>The Indonesian foreign minister is responding vociferously because he and his president don’t want to seen to be supine in response to allegations of Australian eavesdropping. Indonesia is in the countdown to a presidential election next year, and one way to discredit opponents is to accuse them of selling out to western interests. President Yudhoyono is already criticised by nationalists for being too nice to Canberra; and even though he can’t run again, he can’t discount his party being punished if he isn’t seen to be outraged by this apparent assault on Indonesia’s integrity.</p> <p>There’s another element to Natelagawa’s response that can’t be discounted either. Diplomacy is not all about smooth talk and cocktail parties; it’s often a brutal competition for the slightest advantage, even between ostensible friends and allies. The ability to exploit the slightest weakness can be worth its weight in gold as governments manoeuvre against each other.</p> <p>Natelagawa, who studied in Australia, has probably watched the odd State of Origin game. He knows the first 10 minutes of the match are known as the “softening up period” – a stanza of ferocious physicality in which each side tries to cow the opposition into a disadvantageous state of mind. Right now, there's a new government in Canberra, and neighbouring governments are likely to be keen to test its mettle. The odd diplomatic jab can give a better sense of what can be expected from a new government than years of polite cocktail discussions. New Australian governments over the past two decades have had some rocky foreign policy starts – think of the Howard and Rudd governments’ run-ins with Beijing early on – which makes one think that a bit of softening up may have become part of the regional diplomatic scene.</p> <p>Remember, this is not the first time Natelagawa has muscled up to the Abbott government. More than a few eyebrows were raised in Canberra back in September when he disclosed the contents of private discussions with Julie Bishop to the media – on the foreign minister’s first overseas trip no less. For this reason, the government’s neither-confirm-nor-deny, steady-as-she-goes response is spot-on. The last thing they want to do is to look unsettled.</p> <p>Does all of this add up to a new attitude of antagonism in Jakarta? No. Indonesia has demonstrated over several years that it well understands the value of building a robust and pragmatic relationship with Australia. Sometime earlier this year, a decision was made in Jakarta that it needed to do more to meet Australia half-way on the asylum seeker issue – and it has done so, under a distracting cover of grim warnings about Australian policy positions. So too should the current protestations be taken as a bit of Indonesian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang\">wayang</a> theatre, while the real business of collaboration carries on behind the curtains.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421669687|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|c7a36df03864bfba9639f61d617e3faf5e89b33c -->",

        "headline":"Why Australia should celebrate Guy Fawkes night",
        "body":"<p>\"Remember, remember, the fifth of November,\" lectures the old nursery rhyme. It&rsquo;s not really about remembering the date, but what it stands for: the importance of our political processes, and preventing people from hijacking them through public apathy.</p> <p>For the past few weeks, we have been up to our novelty eyeballs in discussions about whether Australia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/31/halloween-in-australia-what-a-terrible-and-spooky-sight\">should celebrate Halloween</a>. But given recent developments in Australia&rsquo;s political landscape, perhaps we should have been discussing whether Australia should celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night\">Guy Fawkes night</a>.</p> <p>In 1605, British authorities arrested a Catholic terrorist who was about to ignite enough explosives to blow the UK&rsquo;s House of Lords. His plot was to kill the king, the Privy Council, and a handful of aristocrats. His goal was to facilitate a Catholic queen&rsquo;s ascension to the throne. His name was Guy Fawkes.</p> <p>History would be kind to Fawkes. Although the fifth&nbsp;of November was instituted as a holiday to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot and an opportunity to stir up anti-Catholic prejudices, Fawkes would eventually be recast as an anti-authoritarian hero. At the start of the 20th Century, he was the protagonist of children&rsquo;s stories; by the end, he was the face of Alan Moore&rsquo;s protagonist in V for Vendetta. David Lloyd, the artist who worked with Moore on V for Vendetta, said that the \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15359735\">Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny</a>\". Although the historical Fawkes differs significantly from the contemporary imagination, his face has entered the popular consciousness as a prompt for questions about civil liberties and the relationship between the population and the state.</p> <p>As a young conservative who is generally in favour of greater state powers, I sit on the other side of the political spectrum from what Fawkes now represents. But despite my position on the right side of the political spectrum, I still find it profoundly disturbing that state and federal governments have been able to pass laws increasing the scope of their power with very little debate in the broader public.</p> <p>Governments have discovered that they don&rsquo;t need to discuss, negotiate, or persuade because the broader public has become almost completely apathetic to the idea of scrutiny and oversight. Activists and academics may write huffy pieces in hyperbolic prose, but the broader public simply does not care. Where there should be genuine outrage and concern, there is an eerie silence from a public that is disaffected, disinterested, and has forgotten the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November.</p> <p>Queensland&rsquo;s \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/queenslands-new-anti-bikie-laws-a-recipe-for-tyranny-david-simon-says\">anti-bikie\" legislative package</a>, for example, seemed to come out of nowhere, was discussed for no more than 30 minutes, and then promptly passed into law. Although there were good reasons to introduce the legislation, the attorney-general of Queensland canvassed none of them. Instead of trying to persuade people with reasoned argument, he opted instead to troll the leader of the opposition over Twitter: \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JarrodBleijieMP/statuses/389991967125299201\">you must tell us who's side you are on, Criminal Motorcycle Gangs or Qld'ers?</a>\". Licensed by the public&rsquo;s lack of interest, other states are <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/vic-qld-on-board-with-our-bikie-lawsnsw/story-e6frfku9-1226749540734\">introducing similar legislation</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the federal level, a weekly press conference satiates the public&rsquo;s interest in the scrutiny of border protection policies. The media and Coalition were once sent into apoplexy every time a boat arrived; now the discussion has gone deathly quiet, as if millions of voices cried out for six years and were suddenly silenced.</p> <p>The situation is so dire that news organisations are resorting to stunts &ndash; like the New Stateman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/russell-brand-on-revolution\">commissioning of Russell Brand as a guest editor</a>, and Jeremy Paxman&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk\">subsequent interview with him on Newsnight</a> &ndash; in a desperate attempt to stir any public interest in politics. But it&rsquo;s a flash in the pan, a brief candle illuminating nothing.</p> <p>It seems weird to complain about this malaise when it so clearly benefits my side of politics, but it feels like an ungallant, ignoble victory. Had St George slayed the dragon while it slept, we wouldn&rsquo;t have written stories about him. Similarly, achieving good political outcomes is more than just getting your legislation into force; it&rsquo;s about having contentious but meaningful policies survive the ordeal of fire, generated by vigorous public discussion and debate.</p> <p>By forgetting the importance of the fifth&nbsp;of November &ndash; whether as a lesson about the importance of protecting political institutions, or as a symbol of anti-authoritarian rebellion &ndash; we have extinguished fiery political conflict with wet blankets of apathy. Our political culture is desperate for symbols behind which the public can rally and express its political concerns. Fawkes gives us that symbol, reinvented time and time again to speak to new political concerns.</p> <p>Who better to symbolise the resistance to more powerful security legislation than a terrorist from the 1600s cast as both the villain and hero of the holiday? How better to reignite the political passions of the public than with a bonfire? What better attracts the public&rsquo;s interest in community than fireworks? Come for the bonfire and the fireworks; stay for the political symbols.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not the whole answer, but popularising political engagement is a good first step. Celebrating Guy Fawkes night hands the flame of political change back to the popular consciousness. Today, it&rsquo;s time to remember the fifth of November.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421664451|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|3c4e285974bf9be70d94d6d681957e814b919988 -->",

        "headline":"Hakimullah Mehsud was hardly Pakistan's great hope for peace",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/hakimullah-mehsud\" title=\"\">Hakimullah Mehsud</a>, leader of the Pakistani Taliban, was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent Pakistanis. Under his leadership, the Taliban targeted Pakistani soldiers and civilians, slaughtered Shia Muslims and almost derailed this year's general election by selectively targeting liberal parties.</p><p>Yet the news <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/pakistani-taliban-leader-hakimullah-mehsud-killed-drone-strike\" title=\"\">of Mehsud's death in a US drone strike</a> on Saturday has not been unanimously well received. The interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, sounded as if he was in mourning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/02/pakistan-taliban-leader-us-drone-strike\" title=\"\">when he said</a>: \"This is not just the killing of one person, it's the death of all peace efforts.\" Imran Khan, who heads the provincial government in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has reiterated a threat to block Nato vehicles from passing through his province unless drone strikes are discontinued. While journalists and others pointed out that Mehsud was terrorising the population of Pakistan, most politicians sounded ambivalent at best.</p><p>This reaction is partly the result of immediate political concerns. The conservative government of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/11/pakistan-elections-turnout-violence-khan\" title=\"\">Nawaz Sharif came to power in May</a> on a platform of peace talks with the Taliban and action against drone strikes. A few weeks ago, Mehsud took the unusual step <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/09/taliban-leader-pakistan-talks-offers\" title=\"\">of giving an interview to the BBC</a> in which he said that his organisation was open to talks. Politicians from both Sharif and Khan's parties are presenting Mehsud's death as a devastating blow to these efforts. Nisar and others have even suggested the US deliberately timed the strike to undermine dialogue.</p><p>The Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which Mehsud had led since 2009, has tentatively said that talks may still go ahead, but it is likely that Mehsud's death will delay the process. Of course, the overblown rhetoric coming from politicians fails to acknowledge that talks with the Taliban were at an embryonic stage. Mehsud's outlandish conditions for dialogue included the imposition of a harsh version of Islamic law across the country. Peace talks with the TTP have taken place before, and have always ended in failure, so it perhaps an over-statement to imply that had Mehsud survived, peace in Pakistan would have prevailed.</p><p>Drone strikes, however, remain politically difficult. The public is divided, but the prevailing mood – encouraged by politicians – is that their use is yet another US violation of Pakistan's sovereignty. As always in Pakistan, the real picture is complex (many people in the areas most affected by terrorism actually support drone attacks, despite civilian deaths), but anti-Americanism is also rife. Even if a common enemy has been killed, it is difficult to celebrate if it is the result of Americans intruding on Pakistani soil. In Pakistan, it can be difficult to have any political discussion without the blame eventually being pinned on America. This paranoia is the result of years of perceived – and often real – double-crossing by the Americans. The confused reaction that results is reflected in how people who deplore terrorism and hate the TTP speak admiringly of the Afghan Taliban because they are standing up to American invaders.</p><p>Pakistan has taken a heavy toll in the war on terror. At least 35,000 people have died in terrorist violence since 2001, a figure that dwarfs the combined death toll in all western countries. Ultimately, the death of a single Taliban leader will make little difference to the group's campaign of terror as the power structures are decentralised enough to absorb such losses. Which begs the question: what hope is there for peace? Clearly, the leaders of Pakistan and the US have yet to find any credible options.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/421628242|2013-11-05T17:53:02Z|36576df6f52f49eaca22ed80b12d9e17842a445c -->",

        "body":"<p>Remember that referendum about whether we should create a single market with the United States? You know, the one that asked whether corporations should have the power to strike down our laws? No, I don't either. Mind you, I spent 10 minutes looking for my watch the other day before I realised I was wearing it. Forgetting about the referendum is another sign of ageing. Because there must have been one, mustn't there? After all that agonising over whether or not we should stay in the European Union, the government wouldn't cede our sovereignty to some shadowy, undemocratic body without consulting us. Would it?</p><p>The purpose of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> is to remove the regulatory differences between the US and European nations. I mentioned it <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2013/10/14/elite-insurgency/\" title=\"\">a couple of weeks ago</a>. But I left out the most important issue: the remarkable ability it would grant big business to sue the living daylights out of governments which try to defend their citizens. It would allow a secretive panel of corporate lawyers to overrule the will of parliament and destroy our legal protections. Yet the defenders of our sovereignty say nothing.</p><p>The mechanism through which this is achieved is known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor-state_dispute_settlement\" title=\"\">investor-state dispute settlement</a>. It's already being used in many parts of the world to kill regulations protecting people and the living planet.</p><p>The Australian government, after massive debates in and out of parliament, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20559585\" title=\"\">decided that cigarettes should be sold in plain packets</a>, marked only with shocking health warnings. The decision was validated by the Australian supreme court. But, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/philip-morris-australia-cigarette-packets\" title=\"\">using a trade agreement Australia struck with Hong Kong</a>, the tobacco company Philip Morris has asked an offshore tribunal to award it a vast sum in compensation for the loss of what it calls its intellectual property.</p><p>During its financial crisis, and in response to public anger over rocketing charges, Argentina imposed a freeze on people's energy and water bills (does this sound familiar?). It was sued by the international utility companies whose vast bills had prompted the government to act. For this and other such crimes, it has been forced to pay out over a billion dollars in compensation. In El Salvador, local communities managed at great cost (<a href=\"http://www.canadians.org/fr/node/5297\" title=\"\">three campaigners were murdered</a>) to persuade the government to refuse permission for a vast gold mine which threatened to contaminate their water supplies. A victory for democracy? Not for long, perhaps. The Canadian company which sought to dig the mine is now suing El Salvador for $315m – for the loss of its anticipated future profits.</p><p>In Canada, the courts revoked two&nbsp;patents owned by the American drugs firm Eli Lilly, on the grounds that&nbsp;the company had not produced enough evidence that they had the beneficial effects it claimed. Eli Lilly is now <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854\" title=\"\">suing the Canadian government for&nbsp;$500m</a>, and demanding that Canada's patent laws are changed.</p><p>These companies (along with hundreds of others) are using the investor-state dispute rules embedded in trade treaties signed by the countries they are suing. The rules are enforced by panels which have none of the safeguards we expect in our own courts. The hearings are held in secret. The judges are corporate lawyers, many of whom work for companies of the kind whose cases they hear. Citizens and communities affected by their decisions have no legal standing. There is no right&nbsp;of appeal on the merits of the&nbsp;case.&nbsp;Yet they can overthrow the sovereignty of parliaments and the rulings of supreme courts.</p><p>You don't believe it? Here's what one of the judges on these tribunals says about his work. \"When I wake up at night and think about arbitration, it never ceases to amaze me that sovereign&nbsp;states have agreed to investment arbitration at all ... Three private individuals are entrusted with the power to review, without any restriction or appeal procedure, all actions of the government, all decisions of the courts, and all laws and regulations emanating from parliament.\"</p><p>There are no corresponding rights for&nbsp;citizens. We can't use these tribunals to demand better protections from corporate greed. As the <a href=\"http://democracyctr.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Under_The_Radar_English_Final.pdf\">Democracy Centre</a> says, this is \"a privatised justice system for global corporations\".</p><p>Even if these suits don't succeed, they can exert a powerful chilling effect on legislation. One Canadian government official, speaking about the rules introduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, remarked: \"I've seen the letters from the New York and DC law firms coming up to the Canadian government on virtually every new environmental regulation and proposition in the last five years. They involved dry-cleaning chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, patent law. Virtually all of the new initiatives were targeted and most of them never saw the light of day.\" Democracy, as a meaningful proposition, is impossible under these circumstances.</p><p>This is the system to which we will&nbsp;be&nbsp;subject if the transatlantic treaty&nbsp;goes ahead. The US and the European commission, both of which have been captured by the corporations they are supposed to regulate, are pressing for investor-state dispute resolution to be included in the agreement.</p><p>The commission justifies this policy by claiming that domestic courts don't offer corporations sufficient protection because they \"might be biased or lack independence\". Which courts is it talking about? Those of the US? Its own member states? It doesn't say. In fact it fails to produce a single concrete example demonstrating the need for a new, extrajudicial system. It is precisely because our courts are generally not biased or lacking independence that the corporations want to bypass them. The EC seeks to replace open, accountable, sovereign courts with a closed, corrupt system riddled with conflicts of interest and arbitrary powers.</p><p>Investor-state rules could be used to smash any attempt to save the NHS from corporate control, to re-regulate the banks, to curb the greed of the energy companies, to renationalise the railways, to leave fossil fuels in the ground. These rules shut down democratic alternatives. They outlaw leftwing politics.</p><p>This is why there has been no attempt by the UK government to inform us about this monstrous assault on democracy, let alone consult us. This is why the Conservatives who huff and puff about sovereignty are silent. Wake up, people we're being shafted.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\"><em>@georgemonbiot</em></a>.
