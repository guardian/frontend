He declared it must be settled this week for the good of the party.</strong></li> <li><strong>Combet suggested that Labor could not go into election indulging a public civil war, so it was up to Kevin Rudd to make his move.</strong></li> <li><strong>Labor backbencher Stephen Jones agreed with Combet. He thought there should be a leadership ballot this week.</strong></li> <li><strong>The result of all that is tonight is a continuing stand-off. Will Rudd challenge, or will he not - and in the meantime can we all focus on something else (say the poor old readers, sick to death of the soap opera)?</strong></li> <li><strong>Parliament celebrated its 25th anniversary as a building. Everyone made lovely reflections on Parliament House growing elegantly and iteratively into its contours and its history. Those of us lucky enough to work here reflected on that privilege.</strong></li> <li><strong>A bunch of MPs made their farewells.</strong></li> <li><strong>The line of the day went to Labor's Harry Jenkins who compared Mark Latham to Lord Voldermort, before arguing even Lord Voldermort had his good points.</strong></li> <li><strong>Liberal Barry Haase was more colourful, reflecting on his inability to call a fairy penguin a fairy penguin due to the scourge of the thought police, who were lurking .. somewhere.</strong></li> <li><strong>The Coalition turned Question Time into a leader-versary. There were a series of questions to Julia Gilard about broken promises and competence and what on earth are you still doing here?</strong></li> <li><strong>Former Blair spin doctor Alister Campbell made a courtesy call on the prime minister, and reflected on social media that it would all be so good for Labor if things weren't so bad.</strong></li> <li><strong>The House of Representatives made like a law-making chamber, and continued consideration of the government's crackdown on the use of 457 visas.</strong></li> <li><strong>That consideration was continuing.</strong></li> </ul> <p>That enough?</p> <p>I reckon it is for tonight.</p> <p>Bless Mike Bowers and Mary and Madhvi in Sydney.

That’s what the people expect us to do and that’s what we will do, should we have the honour of forming a government after the 14th of September.</p> <p>I just want to say that things can be so much better than this. The Australian people know in their hearts that things can be so much better than this. I am confident that, should we form a government, within quite a short space of time people will look back on these days and they will say it was a bad dream that has passed in the night, because our best days as a country are ahead of us; they are ahead of us if we have a government which reflects the strengths, the aspirations and the decencies of the Australian people.</p> <p>Finally, let me just say how proud I am of all of you.

The absolute basic of starting to restore Labor’s political position is to not have this type of speculation. So, I think a few things are clear: one is that the Prime Minister is not about to step down. Two is, senior Cabinet colleagues are not about to ask her to step down. And three is, I think Kevin Rudd does need to decide what he is going to do here. But we cannot come out of this final week of Parliament with this speculation continuing all the way to the election.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>So the worst outcome this week would be the leadership remains untested?</p> <p><strong>GREG COMBET: </strong>It has just got to be resolved.</p> <p><strong>FRAN KELLY: </strong>Is the only way to resolve it to test it?</p> <p><strong>GREG COMBET: </strong>Well, I think Kevin Rudd has to decide whether he is a candidate or not, and then do something about it, if he wants to do something about it. The preconditions that have been articulated through the media over the last couple of weeks for that to happen are not going to occur.

I’ve also included a link to an editorial from The Age newspaper over the weekend calling on the Prime Minister to step aside.</p> <p>I’m interested in reader’s views on that intervention.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Rudd: time to put up or shut up</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://theconversation.com/yet-another-bad-poll-for-gillard-if-anyone-in-labor-is-listening-15451\">Despite the consistently bad polls, Kevin Rudd appears to be cornered, as memories flood back of that night, three years ago today, when Julia Gillard and her supporters knifed him. Unless something unforeseen happens and assuming Gillard holds her nerve, if Rudd wants to reclaim the prize that was snatched away the onus will be on him to try to grab it. The leadership is not going to be handed to him in some consensus fashion. Either Rudd decides to front up and challenge or before week’s end, he concludes the numbers are not there and backs off, claiming he was never trying in the first place.</a> (The Conversation)</p> <p><strong>Poll wipeout for Labor</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/tony-abbott-widens-gap-as-preferred-pm-over-julia-gillard-in-latest-newspoll/story-fn59niix-1226668507117\">Tony Abbott has opened his biggest lead ever over Julia Gillard as preferred prime minister as Labor's primary vote fell below 30 per cent for the first time in a year. With parliament entering its final sitting week before the election, the Opposition Leader now leads the Prime Minister by 12 percentage points after trailing by 30 points as the preferred prime minister when Ms Gillard became leader in June 2010. Facing increasing pressure to step down as Labor leader in favour of Kevin Rudd by the end of the week, Ms Gillard's support as preferred prime minister dropped from 35 to 33 in the latest Newspoll survey, conducted exclusively for The Australian on the weekend. The pressure is continuing to mount on Ms Gillard, with Rudd backers maintaining the Prime Minister has lost the confidence of caucus and the leadership crisis will be decided late this week.</a> (The Australian, paywalled)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/alp-mps-kept-in-dark-on-disastrous-labor-poll-which-predicts-election-wipeout/story-fni0cx12-1226668469923\">An internal ALP report containing polling for 40 seats across Australia, and circulated among selected members of Julia Gillard's leadership group, shows Labor would be lucky to retain 30 to 35 seats after the election.

Ms Gillard should do so in the interests of the Labor Party, in the interests of the nation and, most importantly, in the interests of democracy. The Age's overriding concern is that, under Ms Gillard's leadership, the Labor Party's message about its future policies and vision for Australia is not getting through to the electorate. </a>(The Age, Editorial)</p> <p><strong>Australia’s 40th casualty in Afghanistan</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/defence/commando-leader-becomes-the-40th-digger-to-fall/story-e6frg8yo-1226668502678\">Fighting in Afghanistan continues to take a grim toll on the bravest of Australia's soldiers with another decorated Digger killed in a shootout with insurgents. The as yet unnamed commando, one of the army's highly experienced special forces patrol commanders with a fierce tradition of leading from the front, was the 40th Australian soldier killed in the 11-year conflict.</a> (The Australian, paywalled)</p> <p><strong>Gillard on confidence</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/p/national/media_has_distorted_take_on_economy_cAQuJ4FBJoReIhD9kaSO9I\">Julia Gillard will on Monday lash out at media coverage of the Australian economy, slamming what she calls “unreasonable pessimism” that threatens to undermine confidence, and hurt jobs and growth. The Prime Minister will urge participants at a major annual two-day conference starting in Canberra, to “challenge the negative economic sentiment that is around in some quarters. As Prime Minister, I am concerned that left unchecked, this kind of distorted coverage could continue to spread,” she is expected to say in an opening address to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia’s State of the Nation forum.</a> (Australian Financial Review, paywalled)</p> <p><strong>Another poll - the Lowy Institute poll - with contradictory attitudes to China</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-24/lowy-study-australians-cool-on-china-despite-economic-importance/4774516\">A survey has found Australians continue to have warm feelings toward Great Britain, Germany and the United States, but rate their feelings toward China and Indonesia as not so hot. </a>(ABC)</p> <p><strong>Edward Snowdon</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/23/edward-snowden-gchq\">Edward Snowdon was five hours into his flight from Hong Kong, having already been served one of two hot meals, when news of his departure to Moscow began to electrify media organisations all over the world.
