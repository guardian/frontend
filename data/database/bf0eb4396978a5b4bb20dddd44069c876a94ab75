        "body":"<p>This week saw a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/15/nerd-cabaret-wikipedia-ada-lovelace-day-2013\" title=\"\">day of celebration for Ada Lovelace</a>, a brilliant mathematician who wrote the world's first computer program before computers were even invented. Lovelace grew up in a world of enormous gender inequality, and her first experience of it came moments after birth with her father's reported disappointment that she was not \"the glorious boy\" he had hoped for. But even now, nearly 200 years later, women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) are still fighting an uphill battle against professional gender imbalance.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www.e-skills.com/research/research-publications/women-in-it/\" title=\"\">e-skills UK</a>, women make up just 17% of the UK IT and telecoms workforce. And the number of women in the most senior research positions in Stem in the UK also stands at the paltry figure of 17%, according to a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/women-in-stem-careers/\" title=\"\">2012 European Commission study</a>. Even worse, according to a <a href=\"http://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/files/useruploads/files/wise_stats_document_final.pdf\" title=\"\">2012 Wise campaign report (pdf)</a> only 13% of Stem jobs in the UK are occupied by women.</p><p>So why has progress been so slow since Lovelace blazed her trail some two centuries ago? Partly because women in Stem are still battling attitudes towards women that belong in the 19th century. To celebrate Ada Lovelace day, the <a href=\"http://www.everydaysexism.com\" title=\"\">Everyday Sexism Project</a> invited women on Twitter to share their experiences in Stem careers, good or bad. Many positive stories were shared, with one woman saying she was \"so proud of my electrical engineer mother who's been head of her department for 20+ years\" and others reporting positive moves in the right direction …</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EverydaySexism\">@EverydaySexism</a> My fantastic male science teacher encouraged me into science BECAUSE I'm a woman, not in spite of.

But they are stories that need to be heard. What message does it send to the scores of women facing this outdated, unacceptable discrimination, if they are told to put up and shut up to avoid putting off more women unwittingly signing up to face the same treatment? Burying our heads in the sand won't solve the problem, it'll just make it even more invisible and normalised.</p><p>Far better to get these stories out in the open; to scream and shout about them until something is done. And something does need to be done, because these are just a tiny number of the hundreds of examples we have collected. But the good news is that women aren't taking it lying down. Tomorrow's budding female scientists can take joyful motivation from these strong, inspirational women …</p><blockquote><p>\"I used to purposefully jam the copier so people would stop asking me to make photocopies for their meetings.

Possibly in the shower, though I'd give it my best shot. However, if you are a tad more discerning, then head to the <a href=\"http://www.lindt-excellence.co.uk\">Lindt website,</a> which has the best ways to mix/match your chocolates with coffee and alcohol. Not simultaneously, though then again, why not? Suggested pairings include the dark caramel with a touch of sea salt bar and prosecco, and the high-cocoa 90% bar with a milky latte. Sounds like excellent advice to me (sorry). </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420252792'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381919280239/Hotel-Chocolat-gin-and-pr-008.jpg' alt='Hotel Chocolat gin and prosecco' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><a href=\"http://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/shop/collections/products/cooking-chocolate/dry-gin\">Hotel Chocolat cocoa gin, £15, </a><a href=\"http://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/shop/collections/products/wine-chocolate/classic-prosecco\">and prosecco, £18</a></h2><p>Prosecco seems to be the alcoholic beverage of choice when it comes to scoffing and boozing. Hotel Chocolat has branched out into its own food and wine/spirits range, including this excellent fizz from Valdobbiadene, near Venice. The gin is a very tasty new addition, made in England but using the spices and flavours from the company's estate in Saint Lucia. As it's made using cocoa shells, it's a booze-and-chocolate-pairing of sorts in one bottle. Alternatively, you can peruse the wine list from the restaurant on that Saint Lucia estate and daydream of a trip there.

It is ripe and full with an orange zest aroma.<br /><strong>Pale lemon and sea salt</strong><br />Fabulous with a young Madeira such as a five-year-old. You get a lovely match between the citrus acidity of the Madeira and the rich acidity of the pale lemon – also rather good with the pale lime bar. Another good choice would be a light Prosecco.<br /><strong>Dark Ginger</strong><br />Pair with a sweet <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juran%C3%A7on_AOC\">Jurancon</a>, such as <a href=\"http://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Chateau-Jolys-Cuvee-Jean-Jurancon-Sweet-Wine/36012011\">Chateau Jolys Cuvee Jean</a>.

Josie Lloyd and Emlyn Rees will ask the babysitter to come to their house at 7.15pm. This gives them about a quarter of an hour to chat to her before they need to leave. \"It's important to get the social bit in first,\" says Josie. \"We might not be in a fit state to make conversation when we get back.\"</p><p>Even allowing for this 15-minute leeway, more often than not Josie and Emlyn will struggle to leave on time. Their three daughters aged 13, nine and six will usually find some way of holding them up, and there are bribes to be prepared, ranging from carrots – this <em>is</em> Brighton – to crisps, to make sure the girls behave for the babysitter. More often than not, Josie will still be putting on her makeup as they leave the house.</p><p>They then nip into a pub for a drink. Then to a different pub. Then on to the movies and a meal. Or vice versa. \"Coming out of the cinema at about 11pm, we realise Brighton is no longer a town for us,\" says Emlyn. \"We are extremely old and far too over-dressed.\"</p><p>\"I start muttering, 'Why hasn't that girl got a coat on?\" Josie laughs. \"She'll catch her death of cold.\" They stay clear of bars – \"We're not nearly cool enough and staff would give us withering looks if we went in\" – and try to get home on time for the babysitter.</p><p>Sometimes they make it; often they don't. When they don't, they hand over far too much cash – \"guilt money\" – and hope the babysitter will agree to come again some time soon. After that it's stumble up to bed, hope the kids don't wake up and pray to God for something approaching a lie-in the following morning – 7am would be bliss.</p><p>Pretty much an average night out for most parents with young kids. And it was after one such night that Emlyn noticed a copy of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781406343335\" title=\"\">We're Going on a Bear Hunt</a> lying around. \"We're Going on a Bar Hunt,\" he said, possibly slurring his words a little. \"That's a great idea for a book,\" Josie replied, possibly a little the worse for wear herself.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420234730'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/11/1381490042118/Beer-Hunt-009.jpg' alt='Beer Hunt' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'I still remember the first time we went out alone when our eldest was a baby … we felt elated to be out together' … Josie Lloyd and Emlyn Rees with Tallulah, 13, Roxie, nine, and Minty, six.

So Josie and Emlyn filed it away and then mentioned it to their editor. He, too, thought it was a good idea, commissioned Gillian Johnson to do the illustrations and the part parody, part homage, children's-book-for-adults-who-have-had-children took shape.</p><p>Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury's We're Going on a Bear Hunt became an instant favourite with kids and parents when it was first published in 1989 and has since become a classic. Countless other children's books have come and gone in between, but the appeal of Bear Hunt is timeless. Children just love it. Both my kids – now aged 21 and 18 – adored it, as did all three of Josie and Emlyn's. Some parents have even developed their own set of actions to accompany the text: Emlyn's involve tapping the book and jumping about. You rather have to be there.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420234731'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381929695099/Were-Going-on-a-Bear-Hunt-001.jpg' alt='We're Going on a Bear Hunt' width='220' height='220' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>We're Going on a Bear Hunt by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury was first published in 1989.</figcaption></figure><p>The exact origins of Bear Hunt are imprecise. It's thought to be an old North American camp-fire song, but Rosen first heard of it through the Brownies and started using it in his one-man stage show. \"David Lloyd of Walker Books saw the show and thought it would make a great book,\" he says. \"I'd never previously thought of it as a book, but it seemed like a fun idea and he gave it to Helen to imagine. She really brought it to life.\"</p><p>It might have started in America, but Bear Hunt is a peculiarly British children's bedtime book. Partly because there aren't any bears in this country. \"One of my sons never really enjoyed Bear Hunt,\" says Johnson, \"and it's because my sister lives in Calgary, where there are lots of bears. Her house is full of information about what to do if you come across a bear. In the back of my son's mind, I think there's a part of him that wondered if the bear mightn't be real after all.\"</p><p>Bar Hunt is also a very British parody. Though for rather different reasons. \"The few Americans we've shown it to have been a bit sniffy,\" Emlyn says. \"They think it's a bit irresponsible to be going out partying when you've got young kids at home. And the Spanish just don't get it at all. They have said, 'Why on earth are the parents going out alone? Why aren't they taking the kids with them?''</p><p>It's certainly a parody that will draw a smile from any parent who has tried to hide Bear Hunt from their kids in the hope of introducing a little variation into the bedtime routines, only to be met with tears and a mini-tantrum. Going on holiday without Bear Hunt is a high-risk strategy. Above all, though, Josie and Emlyn hope Bar Hunt will draw a smile from Rosen and Oxenbury. \"When we first started on the project, Michael was appearing at the Brighton festival and there were pictures of him up on almost every street corner,\" says Emlyn. \"Every time we passed one, we'd say 'I hope he likes it,' so we sent an early version to Walker Books. We haven't heard back from Michael or Helen, but I've heard Michael has a good sense of humour, so I hope he sees it's written with love.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420234728'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/11/1381490391623/Bar-hunt-scene-009.jpg' alt='Bar hunt scene' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A scene from We're Going on a Bar Hunt.</figcaption></figure><p>Bar Hunt is written with the same rhythms as the original – \"We're going on a bar hunt. We're going to find a cool one. The babysitter's booked. We're not old!\" – but with the gags on the parents and their occasional bids for freedom. \"I still remember the first time we went out alone when our eldest was about six months old,\" Emlyn says. \"My cousin caught us holding hands and skipping down the road together. He couldn't believe that we weren't more anguished at leaving our daughter behind. But we just felt elated to be out together. We had a real sense of joy and adventure.\" And did he end up with a traffic cone on his head like the character in the book? \"I'd like it on record that it's been at least two decades since I had a road cone on my head.\"</p><p>For Josie and Emlyn, Bar Hunt was also a gentle return to working together. They met after they were both asked to contribute to an article about having their first books published and, over a drink in a pub (there's a theme developing here), Emlyn suggested they might collaborate on a novel. Josie sort of nodded. The following day, Emlyn almost got fired from his job and reckoned he needed a plan B. So he phoned Josie and said: \"You remember that conversation we had last night?\" and she said, \"Not really,\" and they started out from there.</p><p>Come Together was published in 1999 and the couple went on to write six more novels together as well as producing three children. The collaboration fizzled out in 2007 after they felt the format had become a bit too constraining and artificial.</p><p>\"It wasn't that it became difficult,\" says Josie, \"as we always plotted out the storylines in advance together.</p><p>\"The only big row came just after I had had our second daughter and I hadn't been paying enough attention to the narrative. We had to lose 40,000 words. That was a difficult conversation. We just wanted to work on our own books.\"</p><p>The couple have yet to decide whether to collaborate on other children's books. \"It has to be one that resonates with people,\" says Emlyn. \"That has a universality. And there aren't too many of those.\"</p><p>So how have their kids reacted to the book? Do they get the joke? \"Our eldest does,\" says Josie. \"But it leaves the other two blank. Then, it's always hard to tell what kids are taking in and what they aren't. I thought I had been a brilliant mum and had told my daughter everything she needed to know about sex education, but then I came into the kitchen and overheard her asking Emlyn, 'When dogs have babies, do they lay eggs?'</p><p>\"I immediately weighed in with, 'No they don't. Haven't you read the book I gave you? There's the sperm and the egg.' And my daughter goes, 'Yeah, yeah' before saying, 'What about elephants?' so I said, 'It's just the same. The mummy elephant swishes aside her tail and then the Daddy …</p><p>\"It was the word swish that upset her,\" Emlyn says. \"That and making the humping motions.\"</p><p>\"My daughter ran off up the stairs crying,\" Josie continues, \"while Emlyn said, 'I think that went tremendously well.' I was so determined not to get it wrong with my second daughter that I spelled it out clinically to her. She said, 'Why are you telling me this? I'm only&nbsp;eight.'</p><p>\"So you can never get it right.\"</p><h2>Five more children's classics reimagined</h2><h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>The Very Hungry Parasite</strong></h2><p>In which your child turns from an adorably cute baby into a fridge-raiding, grumpy, ungrateful adolescent.</p><h2><strong>2. How Much Do You Owe Me?</strong></h2><p>In which a father quite reasonably reminds his teenager that he is still waiting to be paid back the £10 she borrowed to go out the previous weekend, only to be told that she had to buy \"someone\" a present, her Oyster card went missing and she needed a new pair of shoes and that the father actually owes her another £25.</p><h2><strong>3. The Twat in the Hat</strong></h2><p>In which your partner persuades you that it would be a great idea to have a fancy dress party while the kids are away on a sleepover. You stupidly agree, and the house gets completely&nbsp;trashed. Your partner promises to tidy up but passes out and the kids arrive home to find both you and their home wrecked.</p><h2><strong>4. The Quail and the Whale</strong></h2><p><strong>  </strong></p><p>In which a young quail, curious to see more of the world, hitches a lift on the back of a friendly whale. The whale takes him to all corners of the world before getting beached. The quail then remembers what his parents had told him about stranger danger and lets the whale die instead of rescuing him.</p><h2><strong>5. Where the Mild Things Are</strong></h2><p>In which a couple get fed up with being told how stupid they are by their kids and retreat to their bedroom, which mysteriously turns into a tranquil 1950s world where children are dressed as Enid Blyton characters and only speak when spoken to. The parents come out of their bedroom an hour later to find their children bickering with one another.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419699771|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|3fbed877d1286c8bdcff3dd03a9cefd732029090 -->",

        "headline":"How to make the perfect nachos",
        "body":"<p>This crispy, cheesy snack has become a modern student classic. So, for today's lecture – what's the best way to make nachos?</p><p>A little titbit for the historians among you: although you won't find nachos on menus in Mexico, unlike the chimichanga they were at least created there. The story has it that, back in 1943, the ma&icirc;tre d' of a restaurant in Piedras Negras, faced with a lunch party of American wives from the army base at Eagle Pass and no chef, went into the kitchen and threw together an impromptu meal from what was to hand. The ladies were so impressed by his melange of tortilla chips, cheese and jalape&ntilde;o peppers that they took it home with them – &quot;nachos especiales&quot; features in a 1954 cookbook published by Eagle Pass's Church of the Redeemer, named after its creator, Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Anaya.</p><p>Mexico can't be blamed for that orange slick of cheese sauce that soon replaced Anaya's Wisconsin cheddar, however – in the 70s, nachos became popular fare at sports games in the Lone Star state. To speed up the cooking process, a condensed cheese &quot;product&quot; (it doesn't meet the FDA qualifications for cheese) was developed that would remain obligingly warm and gooey for the duration of play. (A <a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/food/2013/05/the-history-of-baseball-stadium-nachos/\" title=\"\">surprisingly fascinating history of its evolution is available here</a>.)</p><p>It was during my time at university that I first encountered this cheese sauce, at the cinema. Horrified fascination led to a purchase. Suffice to say, before I even begin, I can assure you these nachos will contain no cheese &quot;product&quot;. The other toppings, though, are definitely up for debate.</p><h2>The tortilla chips</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179425\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943287377/Rick-Baylesss-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Bayless\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Rick Bayless's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>I've decided not to use Doritos, mainly on the basis that I'd prefer the base of the dish to taste principally of toasted corn. Salt is acceptable; &quot;cool original&quot; flavour is a distraction.</p><p>Saveur magazine <a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Nachos\" title=\"\">promises to whisk readers back to the &quot;joys of a simpler nacho</a>&quot; – as long as you don't mind frying your own chips. (Tortilla chips weren't widely available commercially until the nacho craze took off.) I cut corn tortillas, which can be found in the speciality food section of larger supermarkets, <a href=\"http://www.mexgrocer.co.uk/Salsa-Verde/\" title=\"\">as well as online</a>, into quarters and fry them in vegetable oil until golden and crisp. They taste pretty good, but despite draining and patting them dry, they're still greasier than the bought version. I must admit to preferring the packaged sort here.</p><p>Rick Bayless, <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2010-02-03/news/36841035_1_nachos-tortilla-chips-tostadas\" title=\"\">chef, restaurateur and author of a number of books on Mexican cooking</a>, suggests an alternative based on the tlayudas (chargrilled tortillas) of Oaxaca, using whole tortillas, brushed with chorizo fat and cooked over direct heat until crisp and slightly charred. They're delicious but unwieldy, and prone to collapsing during consumption: better as an individual snack than a sharing dish.</p><h2>The meat</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179428\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943237306/New-York-Timess-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"New York Times\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>The New York Times's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>Nachos certainly don't need meat – Ignacio's original version, which I suspect the Saveur recipe is based on, is still pretty tasty today, but most recipes more complex than emptying a jar of salsa on to some tortilla chips do seem to involve it.</p><p>At its most simple, in Bayless's dish, this is just fried fresh chorizo, crumbled on to the toasted tortillas, but I also try a quick chilli con carne with minced beef and beans, <a href=\"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/05/loaded-nachos/\" title=\"\">as suggested by blogger turned Food Network star Ree Drummond, AKA the Pioneer Woman</a>; beer-braised <a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/nachos-with-all-the-fixings\" title=\"\">pork carnitas from Bon Appetit magazine</a>; and spicy, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014510/short-rib-chili-nachos.html\" title=\"\">tomatoey beef short ribs from the New York Times</a>, slow-cooked until the meat falls from the bone and all over the tortilla chips.</p><p>I'd highly recommend trying the carnitas and ribs with rice or warm corn tortillas and salad, but I find these two wasted on the nachos. The ribs, in their cumin and coriander spiked sauce, are too intensely savoury with the salty chips (something I also find with the chorizo, which is good with Bayless's tortillas, but too much with chips), and too wet to boot. The tender strands of beery pulled pork, meanwhile, don't deserve to be dried out on a top of a load of crisps.</p><p>Best is the chilli: the smaller pieces of meat are easier to distribute on top of the chips and stand up to baking, remaining moist but not wet (you might want the bottom layer to soften a bit, but you don't want them to be soggy).</p><p>However, much as I'm loth to criticise an Oklahoma cowboy's wife on the subject of chilli, her recipe is a little bland for my taste – and I'd prefer to leave the tomato element for the salsa. That said, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/02/chilli-con-carne-recipe\" title=\"\">my own chilli recipe</a> (which obviously I consider perfect most of the time) is too smoky and wet for this particular dish, so I've made it dryer and slightly more subtle in flavour. I love the body and texture Drummond's beans give, though instead of pinto I've gone for smaller black beans, which are easier to keep on the chips.</p><h2>The sauces</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179426\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943124708/Ree-Drummonds-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Ree Drummond\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Ree Drummond's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>The NYT suggests using a shop-bought salsa, preferably a tangy salsa verde (which can be easily ordered online, though I was surprised to spot it in my local Tesco), while Drummond and Bon Appetit make their own. I love Drummond's super-quick and wonderfully fresh-tasting pico de gallo, using fresh tomatoes, onion, jalape&ntilde;os, coriander and lime juice, though I'll be using spring onions rather than the yellow sort, which I find too harsh when raw. Once flavourful fresh tomatoes are a thing of the past, however, I'd suggest buying a good ready-made salsa, or giving a cooked tomato salsa, <a href=\"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/01/restaurant-style-salsa/\" title=\"\">such as this recipe from Drummond herself</a>, a go.</p><p>Guacamole is also a popular accompaniment to nachos. I already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/aug/12/how-to-make-perfect-guacamole\" title=\"\">have a signature recipe</a>, but on this occasion, Bayless's version, thinned with water to give a drizzling consistency, proves more practical. I love the tart tomatillos he puts in too, but I have to concede these are even harder to get in the UK than a properly ripe avocado, so I've gone for the more traditional lime juice option – if you want to splash out on some online, however, do give his recipe a go.</p><h2>The cheese</h2><p>Obviously an important factor in any nacho recipe, but it's fairly tricky to get hold of the American cheese of choice, monterey jack, in this country. Frankly, I don't think it's worth the effort. Cheddar, as used by Ignacio himself, has a far better flavour and will melt almost as obligingly.</p><p>Bayless calls for queso fresco, a fresh, crumbly cheese, <a href=\"http://gringadairy.com\" title=\"\">now available online</a> and in London and Scotland, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/13/meet-the-producer-mexican-cheesemaker\" title=\"\">Kristen Schnepp of Peckham's Gringa Dairy</a>. It brings a nice, creamy lactic flavour to the dish. If you can't get it, feta, though saltier, has much the same texture. As neither cheese does much in the way of melting, I've decided to mix it into the guacamole – the flavour is excellent with the avocado, and this stops it tumbling off the chips.</p><h2>The toppings</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179427\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943205370/Bon-Appetits-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Bon Appetit\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Bon Appetit's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>Saveur uses pickled jalape&ntilde;os in its recipe, which supply a pleasing tanginess, but even better is the crunch and subtle heat of Bon Appetit's sliced radishes. They also have the benefit of looking rather pink and pretty on a dish that has a tendency towards boring beigeness.</p><p>Many recipes also suggest topping the nachos with sour cream. I find the guacamole creamy enough, but if you'd really like &quot;nachos with all the fixings&quot;, as Bon Appetit describes their version, then by all means blob some on top (they suggest thinning it a little with water), along with some hot chilli sauce for good measure.</p><h2>The cooking method</h2><p>Drummond &quot;nukes&quot; the nachos in a microwave and the NYT grills them, but the best results, I find, come from baking, which heats the dish all the way through without making the base layer soft and chewy. Crisp and hot, cheesy and creamy, spicy and fresh, meaty yet full of beans – trust me, when your mum tearfully reminded you to eat a balanced diet while you were away at university, nachos are what she meant.</p><h2>The perfect nachos</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179429\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943369508/Felicity-Cloakes-perfect--010.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\" s=\"\" perfect=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>(Serves 4)</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>For the chile (or use 250g of your favourite recipe)</em></strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp oil</strong><br /><strong>1 onion, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; green pepper, finely diced</strong><br /><strong>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp flaked chipotle chilli or 1tsp smoked paprika</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp ground cumin</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp Mexican oregano (optional)</strong><br /><strong>250g beef mince</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp dark muscovado sugar</strong><br /><strong>200g cooked black or pinto beans</strong><br /><strong>70ml hot black coffee</strong></p><p><strong><em>For the salsa (or use a decent shop bought version, especially if ripe tomatoes aren't available)</em></strong><br /><strong>2-3 ripe tomatoes, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 spring onions, finely sliced</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; green jalape&ntilde;o chilli, seeded and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Small bunch of coriander, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1&frac12; limes</strong></p><p><strong><em>For the guacamole</em></strong><br /><strong>&frac12;-1 red chilli, deseeded (depending on heat)</strong><br /><strong>Small bunch of coriander</strong><br /><strong>1 large ripe avocado</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>Splash of water</strong><br /><strong>20g queso fresco or feta, crumbled</strong></p><p><strong><em>Plus</em></strong><br /><strong>200g salted corn tortilla chips</strong><br /><strong>100g cheddar, grated</strong><br /><strong>4-5 radishes or pickled jalape&ntilde;os, thinly sliced</strong></p><p>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and soften the chopped onion and pepper.

Repeat this twice more, then put the remaining chilli and cheese on top and bake for about 15 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.</p><p>Top with the salsa, guacamole and sliced radishes or jalape&ntilde;os, and serve immediately, with any extra salsa or guacamole on the side.</p><p><strong>Nachos: cheesy Tex Mex junk or the perfect accompaniment to a well-chilled bottle of Dos Equis and a football game?

        "body":"<p>This is everyone's favourite in Turkey. Long, slender purple eggplants are ideal for this recipe, if you can get them — just leave them whole for the pan-frying step, rather than cutting them in half. Here I've used the round chubby ones; make sure yours don't have seeds in them as these can make the flesh taste bitter. You can also make this dish using boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the lamb or beef. Serves six</p><p><strong>4 eggplants (aubergines) <br />125 ml (½ cup) olive oil<br />2 onions, finely diced<br />2 small green capsicums (peppers), finely diced<br />300 g minced lamb or beef<br />500 g tomatoes, finely diced, plus 6 slices ripe tomato<br />2 tablespoons tomato paste <br />15 g (½ cup) chopped flat-leaf parsley<br />4 garlic cloves, sliced<br />Garlic yoghurt, to serve</strong></p><p>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). </p><p>Using a small knife, peel each eggplant lengthways, in striped-pyjama fashion. Cut each one in half and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan and fry the eggplants over high heat for five minutes, until evenly browned all over, turning them regularly with tongs. </p><p>Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onion to the pan and fry over medium heat, stirring until soft. Add the capsicum and cook for two minutes.</p><p>Add the lamb or beef, diced tomato, tomato paste and most of the parsley, reserving some for garnishing. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for a further five minutes. (The meat will continue cooking in the oven, so it doesn't need to be fully cooked at this stage.) </p><p>Place the eggplants on a baking tray, cut side up. Gently open the bellies then sprinkle the insides with sea salt. Poke the garlic slices into the eggplant flesh. Spoon the meat filling into the belly of each eggplant, then cover each with a slice of tomato.</p><p>Pour 125 ml (½ cup) hot water over the eggplants, cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes, or until the necks of the eggplants are tender. Garnish with the reserved parsley and serve hot, with garlic yoghurt, a green salad and Turkish bread.</p><p>• These recipes come from Turkish Meze by Sevtap Yüce, published by Hardie Grant Books.

        "body":"<p>Last week a friend asked me to cast an eye over her extensive collection of cookbooks. She is moving house and won’t have shelf space for a library accumulated over years of preparing meals for family and friends.</p> <p>What to keep? Anything of real sentimental value and for the rest, pack only well-thumbed classics. Question is: what makes a classic? With the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/sep/30/marcella-hazan-matthew-fort-tribute\"> recent death of Marcella Hazan</a>, uncompromising voice of Italian food for the English-speaking cook, it’s particularly timely.</p> <p>A quick search will produce plenty of classic cookery book lists, each interesting for its linguistic and cultural bias. An Observer list of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/15/top-10-best-cookbooks\"> 50 best cookbooks of all time</a>, for instance, included works by Elizabeth David, Jane Grigson, Nigel Slater, Richard Olney, Simon Hopkinson and Robert Carrier. On the other side of the Atlantic the same exercise would not be complete without Julia Child and Alice Waters,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Boston-Cooking-School-Cookbook-Fannie-Merritt/dp/0517186780\"> Fannie Farmer’s 1896 Boston Cooking-School Cookbook</a> or Irma Rombauer’s 1931 title<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-1931-Facsimile-First/dp/0684833581/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381909535&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=Irma+Rombauer\"> The Joy of Cooking</a>.</p> <p>Australian lists look to local talent first and then more often to familiar English writers such as the omnipresent Ms David. No Australian list would omit<a href=\"http://www.margaretfulton.com.au/\"> Margaret Fulton</a>,<a href=\"http://www.goodfood.com.au/lifestyle/cuisine/a-cooks-life-20120323-1voa9.html\"> Stephanie Alexander</a>, <a href=\"http://www.maggiebeer.com.au/\">Maggie Beer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.davidthompsonthaifood.com/\">David Thompson</a> and<a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/food/person/charmaine-solomon-0\"> Charmaine Solomon</a>. But after that the field is wide open:<a href=\"http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/restaurants/features/285/janni-kyritsis\"> Janni Kyritsis</a>,<a href=\"http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9781920989552/salades\"> Damien Pignolet</a> and many more. It should be added that very few authors produce multiple classics even if they go on writing many books.</p> <p>There are some writers who make it onto multiple anglophone lists: Marcella Hazan, Elizabeth David, Alice Waters, David Thompson, Claudia Roden, and more recently,<a href=\"http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/\"> Fuchsia Dunlop</a>. It’s an evolving and contested business, but what the classics have in common are elements of authority, style and innovation.</p> <p>When it comes to putting together my personal classics, I look to the past. My current interest is in historical recipe books, particularly English classic cookery books of the 19th century, and what they reveal about the experience of those who wrote, published and used them.</p> <p>In the fast-changing world of improved distribution, new wealth and cheaper costs of publishing, 19th century publishers were quick to sign up authors with any possible relevance to the burgeoning middle classes.</p> <p>It was no great leap of imagination for publishers to ask celebrated chefs such as Alexis Soyer (high-profile society chef and all-round food entrepreneur) to turn out cookery books. And while Alexis’s titles proved popular&nbsp;– keeping his commercially prepared sauces and trademarked kitchen appliances in the minds of housekeepers&nbsp;– his books have not stood the test of time. Sound familiar?</p> <p>It took Eliza Acton, a middle-class woman and experienced home cook, to strike a more enduring chord with her audience. Her authority came from years practising and perfecting her craft in her own kitchen. It shows itself on every page of her book, first published in 1845,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Cookery-Families-Southover-Historic-Housekeeping/dp/1870962087\"> Modern Cookery for Private Families</a>: her directions are innovative and her writing free of condescension and laced with humour. Acton received no initial advance for her work but, unlike other female writers, had her name firmly imprinted on the cover. Overnight she made it respectable for women to write cookery books.</p> <p>It was also Acton who added for the first time, lists of ingredients, cooking times and measurements for her recipes as well as highlighting common problems the home cook might encounter. What we now take for granted in a cookery book, she detailed in stylish prose derived from her earlier calling as a minor published poet.</p> <p>She advocated seasonal fresh produce, less sugar than is popular today and was remarkably light in her dishes. She was also an outspoken advocate of unadulterated ingredients and the serious pleasure of preparing wholesome food for the table. Her book was, as its title promised, “modern” in every way; a hugely successful cookery book that stood the test of time to become a classic.</p> <p>What titles would you add to your classic list?</p> <p><em>• Sarah Benjamin will be talking about classic cookbooks on 19 October at the <a href=\"http://foodandwords.com.au/food-writers-festival/\">Food Writers’ festival at The Mint, Sydney</a>. Tickets $185 or $245 (with lunch).</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420203716|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|9c45ed103dd886bbd05d7c8485edc0fddc5430ea -->",

Now bone marrow is making its way back on to the supermarket shelves.</p><p>Waitrose, which is also trying to revive other traditional and cheap cuts of meat such as kidney, belly pork, lamb's liver and oxtail, will start selling beef bone marrow this week in all its UK stores as part of its Forgotten Cuts range.</p><p>Waitrose's meat buyer Rob Hues said: \"Our customers have embraced the Forgotten Cuts we've introduced over the last five years – they understand that by adopting slow-cooking methods they will be able to create great value meals that pack in masses of flavour.\"</p><p>The chef Fergus Henderson, founder of the cult restaurant St John near London's Smithfield meat market, has made roast veal bone marrow – served with toast and a lemon-dressed parsley salad – his signature dish, always on the menu.</p><p>Bones bought from butchers were traditionally roasted upright and the marrow – a paste-like substance inside – extracted to be spread on toast or with salad or used as a base to enrich stock, soups, gravies and sauces. The marrow melts, then caramelises and can be subsequently re-constituted with liquid and aromatics. High in fat but also highly nutritious (rich in protein and fat-soluble vitamins A and D), it was popular in wartime to add much-needed flavour to soups, stews and other dishes.</p><p>Hues went on: \"Bone marrow has been a key ingredient in some of London's top meat restaurants such as Hawksmoor and St John's where they both promote the nose-to-tail dining experience. Those in the know understand that by adding bone marrow you can intensify meaty flavours.\"</p><p>The supermarket will enlist the help of its food ambassador Heston Blumenthal to put bone marrow top of Britons' shopping lists with a recipe for traditional minced beef and dumplings. It will be unveiled in a TV and print advertising campaign and supported in store with a recipe card and an introductory offer of one third off the price of a pack of diced beef shin with bone marrow.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420177128|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|ee3d58609f2aac59dad11a72f46e189567f97d36 -->",

        "body":"<p>I'm worried about my coconut milk caramels. Inside their paper twists, they look like small, soft brown slugs and no one wants them. There is interest in my marmalade, honeycomb, blackcurrant pastilles and flapjacks though. Even the sludgy-looking spicy blackberry chutney has attracted some offers. Meanwhile, my bid card for the caramels remains blank.</p><p>I'm at my local community centre in Altrincham, near Manchester, where the <a href=\"http://www.applesforeggs.com/\" title=\"\">Apples for Eggs food swap</a> is celebrating its two-year anniversary in a frenzy of cinnamon buns, fruit leather and homemade pesto. The idea is simple: three times a year, when there is a lot of produce about, members meet to swap homemade, grown or foraged food. No money changes hands, and it's accepted that everything's been made in a home kitchen. Swapping has proved popular as a way to absorb gluts, get hold of unusual varieties of produce and meet like-minded locals.</p><p>When founder Vicky Swift set up the group in 2011, she was joining a growing international movement. \"We had an allotment, with the usual gluts,\" she says. \"I was thinking: 'Maybe there's something I can do with all this food.' My other half, Jim, said: 'Why don't you just swap it?'\" Organising individual swaps via Facebook had limited success. \"I  researched food exchanging, and came across the <a href=\"http://lafoodswap.com/\" title=\"\">LA Food Swap</a>. They have guidelines for setting swaps up, so we gave it a go.\"</p><p>Apples for Eggs now has 159 registered swappers and events in York, Ormskirk, Henley and Stoke, with Brampton in Cumbria the newest swap. There are many similar events across the UK (find them at <a href=\"http://www.foodswapnetwork.com\" title=\"\">foodswapnetwork.com</a>) and in Brazil, Denmark, France and the Netherlands.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420156310'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381931998511/Food-swap-in-Altrincham-010.jpg' alt='Food swap in Altrincham' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Homemade jellies and syrups. Photograph: PR</figcaption></figure><p>At the community centre, bids are being made. Here, your produce is your currency, and swappers are cruising the room, noting their interest by filling in bid cards at the 15 different stands before the big exchange starts. I am hopeless at growing anything so I'm offering homemade sweets and bakes, and hoping to take green stuff home. It's not looking bad. </p><p>Martin Dolce is offering \"anything\" – within reason, I expect – for a bag of blackcurrant pastilles. And Sarah Walmsley has got a kilo of tomatoes for a stack of my salt caramel flapjacks. But these are expressions of interest, not promises. Dolce (whose runner beans I covet) explains that when it's time to swap, you've got to move fast. \"The first time I was forewarned that it would get a bit frantic. I thought: 'I'm a businessman, I can handle it.' I didn't know what was going on and I missed the choice stuff. Now I proactively go and grab something I like: you want that, I've got that, boom. The first five minutes are crucial.\"</p><p>According to Swift, Altrincham was an unusual location: \"It's not necessarily a home produce-y place,\" she says. \"Friends said I should do it somewhere a bit more right-on. But I've made some great friends, and found all sorts of other community projects.\" Specialist knowledge is exchanged alongside produce. \"It's lovely to seek advice from locals, rather than referring to a recipe book or a celebrity expert,\" Swift says. \"There are experts in our community who really know their stuff.\"</p><p>Swapping isn't for everyone. Nicki Jones, whose stand is loaded with cakes still warm from the oven, loves it, but adds: \"This would be my mother's worst nightmare. She couldn't bear the thought of having anyone else's things.\" Happily, this ick factor isn't much in evidence today – the focus is on getting a good swap. </p><p>Fired up by Dolce's advice, when the frenzy descends I make a beeline for my top picks. I miss out on a few things, but after some friendly but determined bartering I go home with apples, raspberries, muffins, pesto, chard, garlic, eggs, rowanberry and apple jelly, horseradish, Jerusalem artichokes, sausage rolls, runner beans and biscuits, which seems ample reward. And, miraculously, no coconut milk caramels: in the end, they all got swapped.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420150832|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|a041538cf0f595af549cb139937dd4c4afdc43a3 -->",

        "headline":"How to make the perfect nachos",
        "body":"<p>This crispy, cheesy snack has become a modern student classic. So, for today's lecture – what's the best way to make nachos?</p><p>A little titbit for the historians among you: although you won't find nachos on menus in Mexico, unlike the chimichanga they were at least created there. The story has it that, back in 1943, the ma&icirc;tre d' of a restaurant in Piedras Negras, faced with a lunch party of American wives from the army base at Eagle Pass and no chef, went into the kitchen and threw together an impromptu meal from what was to hand. The ladies were so impressed by his melange of tortilla chips, cheese and jalape&ntilde;o peppers that they took it home with them – &quot;nachos especiales&quot; features in a 1954 cookbook published by Eagle Pass's Church of the Redeemer, named after its creator, Ignacio &quot;Nacho&quot; Anaya.</p><p>Mexico can't be blamed for that orange slick of cheese sauce that soon replaced Anaya's Wisconsin cheddar, however – in the 70s, nachos became popular fare at sports games in the Lone Star state. To speed up the cooking process, a condensed cheese &quot;product&quot; (it doesn't meet the FDA qualifications for cheese) was developed that would remain obligingly warm and gooey for the duration of play. (A <a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/food/2013/05/the-history-of-baseball-stadium-nachos/\" title=\"\">surprisingly fascinating history of its evolution is available here</a>.)</p><p>It was during my time at university that I first encountered this cheese sauce, at the cinema. Horrified fascination led to a purchase. Suffice to say, before I even begin, I can assure you these nachos will contain no cheese &quot;product&quot;. The other toppings, though, are definitely up for debate.</p><h2>The tortilla chips</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179425\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943287377/Rick-Baylesss-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Bayless\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Rick Bayless's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>I've decided not to use Doritos, mainly on the basis that I'd prefer the base of the dish to taste principally of toasted corn. Salt is acceptable; &quot;cool original&quot; flavour is a distraction.</p><p>Saveur magazine <a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Nachos\" title=\"\">promises to whisk readers back to the &quot;joys of a simpler nacho</a>&quot; – as long as you don't mind frying your own chips. (Tortilla chips weren't widely available commercially until the nacho craze took off.) I cut corn tortillas, which can be found in the speciality food section of larger supermarkets, <a href=\"http://www.mexgrocer.co.uk/Salsa-Verde/\" title=\"\">as well as online</a>, into quarters and fry them in vegetable oil until golden and crisp. They taste pretty good, but despite draining and patting them dry, they're still greasier than the bought version. I must admit to preferring the packaged sort here.</p><p>Rick Bayless, <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2010-02-03/news/36841035_1_nachos-tortilla-chips-tostadas\" title=\"\">chef, restaurateur and author of a number of books on Mexican cooking</a>, suggests an alternative based on the tlayudas (chargrilled tortillas) of Oaxaca, using whole tortillas, brushed with chorizo fat and cooked over direct heat until crisp and slightly charred. They're delicious but unwieldy, and prone to collapsing during consumption: better as an individual snack than a sharing dish.</p><h2>The meat</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179428\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943237306/New-York-Timess-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"New York Times\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>The New York Times's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>Nachos certainly don't need meat – Ignacio's original version, which I suspect the Saveur recipe is based on, is still pretty tasty today, but most recipes more complex than emptying a jar of salsa on to some tortilla chips do seem to involve it.</p><p>At its most simple, in Bayless's dish, this is just fried fresh chorizo, crumbled on to the toasted tortillas, but I also try a quick chilli con carne with minced beef and beans, <a href=\"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/05/loaded-nachos/\" title=\"\">as suggested by blogger turned Food Network star Ree Drummond, AKA the Pioneer Woman</a>; beer-braised <a href=\"http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/nachos-with-all-the-fixings\" title=\"\">pork carnitas from Bon Appetit magazine</a>; and spicy, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014510/short-rib-chili-nachos.html\" title=\"\">tomatoey beef short ribs from the New York Times</a>, slow-cooked until the meat falls from the bone and all over the tortilla chips.</p><p>I'd highly recommend trying the carnitas and ribs with rice or warm corn tortillas and salad, but I find these two wasted on the nachos. The ribs, in their cumin and coriander spiked sauce, are too intensely savoury with the salty chips (something I also find with the chorizo, which is good with Bayless's tortillas, but too much with chips), and too wet to boot. The tender strands of beery pulled pork, meanwhile, don't deserve to be dried out on a top of a load of crisps.</p><p>Best is the chilli: the smaller pieces of meat are easier to distribute on top of the chips and stand up to baking, remaining moist but not wet (you might want the bottom layer to soften a bit, but you don't want them to be soggy).</p><p>However, much as I'm loth to criticise an Oklahoma cowboy's wife on the subject of chilli, her recipe is a little bland for my taste – and I'd prefer to leave the tomato element for the salsa. That said, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/02/chilli-con-carne-recipe\" title=\"\">my own chilli recipe</a> (which obviously I consider perfect most of the time) is too smoky and wet for this particular dish, so I've made it dryer and slightly more subtle in flavour. I love the body and texture Drummond's beans give, though instead of pinto I've gone for smaller black beans, which are easier to keep on the chips.</p><h2>The sauces</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179426\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943124708/Ree-Drummonds-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Ree Drummond\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Ree Drummond's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>The NYT suggests using a shop-bought salsa, preferably a tangy salsa verde (which can be easily ordered online, though I was surprised to spot it in my local Tesco), while Drummond and Bon Appetit make their own. I love Drummond's super-quick and wonderfully fresh-tasting pico de gallo, using fresh tomatoes, onion, jalape&ntilde;os, coriander and lime juice, though I'll be using spring onions rather than the yellow sort, which I find too harsh when raw. Once flavourful fresh tomatoes are a thing of the past, however, I'd suggest buying a good ready-made salsa, or giving a cooked tomato salsa, <a href=\"http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2010/01/restaurant-style-salsa/\" title=\"\">such as this recipe from Drummond herself</a>, a go.</p><p>Guacamole is also a popular accompaniment to nachos. I already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/aug/12/how-to-make-perfect-guacamole\" title=\"\">have a signature recipe</a>, but on this occasion, Bayless's version, thinned with water to give a drizzling consistency, proves more practical. I love the tart tomatillos he puts in too, but I have to concede these are even harder to get in the UK than a properly ripe avocado, so I've gone for the more traditional lime juice option – if you want to splash out on some online, however, do give his recipe a go.</p><h2>The cheese</h2><p>Obviously an important factor in any nacho recipe, but it's fairly tricky to get hold of the American cheese of choice, monterey jack, in this country. Frankly, I don't think it's worth the effort. Cheddar, as used by Ignacio himself, has a far better flavour and will melt almost as obligingly.</p><p>Bayless calls for queso fresco, a fresh, crumbly cheese, <a href=\"http://gringadairy.com\" title=\"\">now available online</a> and in London and Scotland, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/13/meet-the-producer-mexican-cheesemaker\" title=\"\">Kristen Schnepp of Peckham's Gringa Dairy</a>. It brings a nice, creamy lactic flavour to the dish. If you can't get it, feta, though saltier, has much the same texture. As neither cheese does much in the way of melting, I've decided to mix it into the guacamole – the flavour is excellent with the avocado, and this stops it tumbling off the chips.</p><h2>The toppings</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179427\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943205370/Bon-Appetits-nachos-002.jpg\" alt=\"Bon Appetit\" s=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Bon Appetit's nachos.</figcaption></figure><p>Saveur uses pickled jalape&ntilde;os in its recipe, which supply a pleasing tanginess, but even better is the crunch and subtle heat of Bon Appetit's sliced radishes. They also have the benefit of looking rather pink and pretty on a dish that has a tendency towards boring beigeness.</p><p>Many recipes also suggest topping the nachos with sour cream. I find the guacamole creamy enough, but if you'd really like &quot;nachos with all the fixings&quot;, as Bon Appetit describes their version, then by all means blob some on top (they suggest thinning it a little with water), along with some hot chilli sauce for good measure.</p><h2>The cooking method</h2><p>Drummond &quot;nukes&quot; the nachos in a microwave and the NYT grills them, but the best results, I find, come from baking, which heats the dish all the way through without making the base layer soft and chewy. Crisp and hot, cheesy and creamy, spicy and fresh, meaty yet full of beans – trust me, when your mum tearfully reminded you to eat a balanced diet while you were away at university, nachos are what she meant.</p><h2>The perfect nachos</h2><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-420179429\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381943369508/Felicity-Cloakes-perfect--010.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\" s=\"\" perfect=\"\" nachos'=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>(Serves 4)</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>For the chile (or use 250g of your favourite recipe)</em></strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp oil</strong><br /><strong>1 onion, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; green pepper, finely diced</strong><br /><strong>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp flaked chipotle chilli or 1tsp smoked paprika</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp ground cumin</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp Mexican oregano (optional)</strong><br /><strong>250g beef mince</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp dark muscovado sugar</strong><br /><strong>200g cooked black or pinto beans</strong><br /><strong>70ml hot black coffee</strong></p><p><strong><em>For the salsa (or use a decent shop bought version, especially if ripe tomatoes aren't available)</em></strong><br /><strong>2-3 ripe tomatoes, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 spring onions, finely sliced</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; green jalape&ntilde;o chilli, seeded and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Small bunch of coriander, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1&frac12; limes</strong></p><p><strong><em>For the guacamole</em></strong><br /><strong>&frac12;-1 red chilli, deseeded (depending on heat)</strong><br /><strong>Small bunch of coriander</strong><br /><strong>1 large ripe avocado</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>Splash of water</strong><br /><strong>20g queso fresco or feta, crumbled</strong></p><p><strong><em>Plus</em></strong><br /><strong>200g salted corn tortilla chips</strong><br /><strong>100g cheddar, grated</strong><br /><strong>4-5 radishes or pickled jalape&ntilde;os, thinly sliced</strong></p><p>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and soften the chopped onion and pepper.

Repeat this twice more, then put the remaining chilli and cheese on top and bake for about 15 minutes, or until the cheese has melted.</p><p>Top with the salsa, guacamole and sliced radishes or jalape&ntilde;os, and serve immediately, with any extra salsa or guacamole on the side.</p><p><strong>Nachos: cheesy Tex Mex junk or the perfect accompaniment to a well-chilled bottle of Dos Equis and a football game?

Josie Lloyd and Emlyn Rees will ask the babysitter to come to their house at 7.15pm. This gives them about a quarter of an hour to chat to her before they need to leave. \"It's important to get the social bit in first,\" says Josie. \"We might not be in a fit state to make conversation when we get back.\"</p><p>Even allowing for this 15-minute leeway, more often than not Josie and Emlyn will struggle to leave on time. Their three daughters aged 13, nine and six will usually find some way of holding them up, and there are bribes to be prepared, ranging from carrots – this <em>is</em> Brighton – to crisps, to make sure the girls behave for the babysitter. More often than not, Josie will still be putting on her makeup as they leave the house.</p><p>They then nip into a pub for a drink. Then to a different pub. Then on to the movies and a meal. Or vice versa. \"Coming out of the cinema at about 11pm, we realise Brighton is no longer a town for us,\" says Emlyn. \"We are extremely old and far too over-dressed.\"</p><p>\"I start muttering, 'Why hasn't that girl got a coat on?\" Josie laughs. \"She'll catch her death of cold.\" They stay clear of bars – \"We're not nearly cool enough and staff would give us withering looks if we went in\" – and try to get home on time for the babysitter.</p><p>Sometimes they make it; often they don't. When they don't, they hand over far too much cash – \"guilt money\" – and hope the babysitter will agree to come again some time soon. After that it's stumble up to bed, hope the kids don't wake up and pray to God for something approaching a lie-in the following morning – 7am would be bliss.</p><p>Pretty much an average night out for most parents with young kids. And it was after one such night that Emlyn noticed a copy of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781406343335\" title=\"\">We're Going on a Bear Hunt</a> lying around. \"We're Going on a Bar Hunt,\" he said, possibly slurring his words a little. \"That's a great idea for a book,\" Josie replied, possibly a little the worse for wear herself.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420234730'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/11/1381490042118/Beer-Hunt-009.jpg' alt='Beer Hunt' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>'I still remember the first time we went out alone when our eldest was a baby … we felt elated to be out together' … Josie Lloyd and Emlyn Rees with Tallulah, 13, Roxie, nine, and Minty, six. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>It was one of those great ideas that still seemed great the morning after the night before. So Josie and Emlyn filed it away and then mentioned it to their editor. He, too, thought it was a good idea, commissioned Gillian Johnson to do the illustrations and the part parody, part homage, children's-book-for-adults-who-have-had-children took shape.</p><p>Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury's We're Going on a Bear Hunt became an instant favourite with kids and parents when it was first published in 1989 and has since become a classic. Countless other children's books have come and gone in between, but the appeal of Bear Hunt is timeless. Children just love it. Both my kids – now aged 21 and 18 – adored it, as did all three of Josie and Emlyn's. Some parents have even developed their own set of actions to accompany the text: Emlyn's involve tapping the book and jumping about. You rather have to be there.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420234731'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/16/1381929695099/Were-Going-on-a-Bear-Hunt-001.jpg' alt='We're Going on a Bear Hunt' width='220' height='220' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>We're Going on a Bear Hunt by Michael Rosen and Helen Oxenbury was first published in 1989.</figcaption></figure><p>The exact origins of Bear Hunt are imprecise. It's thought to be an old North American camp-fire song, but Rosen first heard of it through the Brownies and started using it in his one-man stage show. \"David Lloyd of Walker Books saw the show and thought it would make a great book,\" he says. \"I'd never previously thought of it as a book, but it seemed like a fun idea and he gave it to Helen to imagine. She really brought it to life.\"</p><p>It might have started in America, but Bear Hunt is a peculiarly British children's bedtime book. Partly because there aren't any bears in this country. \"One of my sons never really enjoyed Bear Hunt,\" says Johnson, \"and it's because my sister lives in Calgary, where there are lots of bears. Her house is full of information about what to do if you come across a bear. In the back of my son's mind, I think there's a part of him that wondered if the bear mightn't be real after all.\"</p><p>Bar Hunt is also a very British parody. Though for rather different reasons. \"The few Americans we've shown it to have been a bit sniffy,\" Emlyn says. \"They think it's a bit irresponsible to be going out partying when you've got young kids at home. And the Spanish just don't get it at all. They have said, 'Why on earth are the parents going out alone? Why aren't they taking the kids with them?''</p><p>It's certainly a parody that will draw a smile from any parent who has tried to hide Bear Hunt from their kids in the hope of introducing a little variation into the bedtime routines, only to be met with tears and a mini-tantrum. Going on holiday without Bear Hunt is a high-risk strategy. Above all, though, Josie and Emlyn hope Bar Hunt will draw a smile from Rosen and Oxenbury. \"When we first started on the project, Michael was appearing at the Brighton festival and there were pictures of him up on almost every street corner,\" says Emlyn. \"Every time we passed one, we'd say 'I hope he likes it,' so we sent an early version to Walker Books. We haven't heard back from Michael or Helen, but I've heard Michael has a good sense of humour, so I hope he sees it's written with love.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420234728'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/11/1381490391623/Bar-hunt-scene-009.jpg' alt='Bar hunt scene' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A scene from We're Going on a Bar Hunt.</figcaption></figure><p>Bar Hunt is written with the same rhythms as the original – \"We're going on a bar hunt. We're going to find a cool one. The babysitter's booked. We're not old!\" – but with the gags on the parents and their occasional bids for freedom. \"I still remember the first time we went out alone when our eldest was about six months old,\" Emlyn says. \"My cousin caught us holding hands and skipping down the road together. He couldn't believe that we weren't more anguished at leaving our daughter behind. But we just felt elated to be out together. We had a real sense of joy and adventure.\" And did he end up with a traffic cone on his head like the character in the book? \"I'd like it on record that it's been at least two decades since I had a road cone on my head.\"</p><p>For Josie and Emlyn, Bar Hunt was also a gentle return to working together. They met after they were both asked to contribute to an article about having their first books published and, over a drink in a pub (there's a theme developing here), Emlyn suggested they might collaborate on a novel. Josie sort of nodded. The following day, Emlyn almost got fired from his job and reckoned he needed a plan B. So he phoned Josie and said: \"You remember that conversation we had last night?\" and she said, \"Not really,\" and they started out from there.</p><p>Come Together was published in 1999 and the couple went on to write six more novels together as well as producing three children. The collaboration fizzled out in 2007 after they felt the format had become a bit too constraining and artificial.</p><p>\"It wasn't that it became difficult,\" says Josie, \"as we always plotted out the storylines in advance together.</p><p>\"The only big row came just after I had had our second daughter and I hadn't been paying enough attention to the narrative. We had to lose 40,000 words. That was a difficult conversation. We just wanted to work on our own books.\"</p><p>The couple have yet to decide whether to collaborate on other children's books. \"It has to be one that resonates with people,\" says Emlyn. \"That has a universality. And there aren't too many of those.\"</p><p>So how have their kids reacted to the book? Do they get the joke? \"Our eldest does,\" says Josie. \"But it leaves the other two blank. Then, it's always hard to tell what kids are taking in and what they aren't. I thought I had been a brilliant mum and had told my daughter everything she needed to know about sex education, but then I came into the kitchen and overheard her asking Emlyn, 'When dogs have babies, do they lay eggs?'</p><p>\"I immediately weighed in with, 'No they don't. Haven't you read the book I gave you? There's the sperm and the egg.' And my daughter goes, 'Yeah, yeah' before saying, 'What about elephants?' so I said, 'It's just the same. The mummy elephant swishes aside her tail and then the Daddy …</p><p>\"It was the word swish that upset her,\" Emlyn says. \"That and making the humping motions.\"</p><p>\"My daughter ran off up the stairs crying,\" Josie continues, \"while Emlyn said, 'I think that went tremendously well.' I was so determined not to get it wrong with my second daughter that I spelled it out clinically to her. She said, 'Why are you telling me this? I'm only&nbsp;eight.'</p><p>\"So you can never get it right.\"</p><h2>Five more children's classics reimagined</h2><h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>The Very Hungry Parasite</strong></h2><p>In which your child turns from an adorably cute baby into a fridge-raiding, grumpy, ungrateful adolescent.</p><h2><strong>2. How Much Do You Owe Me?</strong></h2><p>In which a father quite reasonably reminds his teenager that he is still waiting to be paid back the £10 she borrowed to go out the previous weekend, only to be told that she had to buy \"someone\" a present, her Oyster card went missing and she needed a new pair of shoes and that the father actually owes her another £25.</p><h2><strong>3. The Twat in the Hat</strong></h2><p>In which your partner persuades you that it would be a great idea to have a fancy dress party while the kids are away on a sleepover. You stupidly agree, and the house gets completely&nbsp;trashed. Your partner promises to tidy up but passes out and the kids arrive home to find both you and their home wrecked.</p><h2><strong>4. The Quail and the Whale</strong></h2><p><strong>  </strong></p><p>In which a young quail, curious to see more of the world, hitches a lift on the back of a friendly whale. The whale takes him to all corners of the world before getting beached. The quail then remembers what his parents had told him about stranger danger and lets the whale die instead of rescuing him.</p><h2><strong>5. Where the Mild Things Are</strong></h2><p>In which a couple get fed up with being told how stupid they are by their kids and retreat to their bedroom, which mysteriously turns into a tranquil 1950s world where children are dressed as Enid Blyton characters and only speak when spoken to. The parents come out of their bedroom an hour later to find their children bickering with one another.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419699771|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|3fbed877d1286c8bdcff3dd03a9cefd732029090 -->",

A sort of makeshift undercut.</p><p>A growing trend, the man bun cannot be blamed on any one culprit, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/21/jake-gyllenhaal-prisoners-donnie-darko\" title=\"\">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> is its latest disciple. He was spotted on the set of his new movie Nightcrawlers <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/jake-gyllenhaal-is-a-man-with-a-bun\" title=\"\">sporting a fine man bun</a>. Others have preceded him – One Direction's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2013/aug/21/harry-styles-makeup-for-men-one-direction\" title=\"\">Harry Styles</a> and Leonardo di Caprio included. Andy Carroll – one of the few footballers since David Seaman's 90s heyday to still go for flowing tresses – dates the trend to Euro 2012, and David Beckham <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2013/may/17/david-beckham-hairstyles-pictures\" title=\"\">obviously did it yonks ago</a>. But it's probably Bradley Cooper who has become this year's <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/bradley-coopers-bun-is-back\" title=\"\">patron saint of the man bun</a>. He's been wearing his pretty consistently since May, sometimes even freestyling with two for a mohican-meets-bunches effect.</p><p>While that might only be advisable for the experienced man-bun wearer, the classic version could be coming to a male near you soon. In real life. There are several YouTube \"how to\" videos up – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmHYukht3g\" title=\"\">one with nearly 100,000 views</a> – and they are already all over east London, an area that has  become the frontline for a look that could be described as part woodcutter, part obscure conceptual artist. Sophie Tok, co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.tommyguns-shoreditch.com\" title=\"\">hair salon Tommyguns in Shoreditch, east London</a>, believes the trend started in around 2010, \"when the 90s undercut came back. Guys wear them with beards and tattoos.\" For Tok, at the coalface of experimental hair in east London, \"they're over – a low undercut is coming in, shaving the hair into a triangular point at the back.\" While that could have most of the male population running for the hills, it's a sure sign the man bun has reached a tipping point for the mainstream. Households with hair elastics for both genders are only a matter of time.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420160028|2013-10-17T12:53:06Z|d4d764cd94e735a9cd401d1c0d289a1751c36fd1 -->",
