        "body":"<p>Despite an alumni that includes Nobel laureate WB Yeats, former president Mary Robinson and the gay rights campaigner and James Joyce expert David Norris, Ireland's electorate is expected on Friday to vote for the abolition of the Republic's second parliamentary chamber.</p><p>But as Irish voters go to the polls in a referendum to turn the Republic into a unicameral democracy, defenders of the Seanad (Senate) say abolishing it will lead to a \"power grab\" by the taoiseach, Enda Kenny.</p><p>The last national opinion poll published by the Irish Times/MRBI Ipsos at the start of this week found that 44% will vote to get rid of the Seanad while 27% will oppose abolition.</p><p>Senators such as one of Ireland's leading cancer surgeons John Crown are now pinning their hopes on the 21% undecided moving to the NO camp.<br />For Kenny, the referendum, which also includes a vote on creating a new Irish court of appeal, is a key test of his authority as premier ahead of yet another austerity budget later this month.</p><p>But for Crown and fellow Senators, as well as the main opposition party Fianna Fáil, Kenny's claim that abolition will save €20m (£17m) a year masks the taoiseach and his Fine Gael party's real desire to concentrate more political powers in their hands.</p><p>\"The Seanad has tabled 500 amendments to legislation in the life time of this current government. So, it is spurious to claim it does nothing. In fact it plays a role in improving legislation such as the recent insolvency bill during which Seanad amendments added more protection for mortgage holders from predatory, greedy banks.</p><p>\"In addition, abolition will mean for example that the only economist on the joint parliamentary committee for finance, who happens to be a member of the Seanad, will lose his post. Abolition means the joint parliamentary health committee will lose the only doctor on the panel, ie myself. The oversight, the checks and balances and the expertise the Seanad provides will all be lost if there is a yes vote,\" Crown told the Guardian on the eve of the referendum.</p><p>More than 40% polled in the last survey cited the cost of the Seanad as their reason for voting Yes.</p><p>Seizing upon the cost issue, the taoiseach sought to bolster support for abolition.</p><p>\"Friday is your day to have that voice heard very strongly to radically change our institutions. Politicians must always put people's needs first. The referendum clearly does that. The Seanad is ineffective and undemocratic, it costs €20m a year to run, and has never engaged with the Irish public the way it should have,\" Kenny said while on walkabout in Dublin.</p><p>The Seanad is appointed partly by parties in the Dáil, the lower chamber, nominating their own senators, or by the trade unions and the votes of university graduates and staff who normally elect favoured academics to the second chamber.</p><p>Derek Mooney, a campaigner for the no side, however claims that the government's promise to save €20m is a \"con job\".</p><p>Mooney says: \"The figure is around €9m gross and €6m net in terms of abolition. Not one cent will be saved for another three years, but yet €14m will be spent this year on having this unnecessary referendum.\"</p><p>He points out that one of the dangers of having a single chamber is that a government with a large majority such as the one the Fine Gael-Labour coalition commands could for instance remove independent judges by a vote from a single chamber.</p><p>Mooney adds that what Ireland needs instead are \"better politicians, not fewer politicians\" and that this government has backtracked on its promise to cut back on Dáil deputies salaries in solidarity with a nation enduring austerity cuts.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418983680|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|a7f6de0047f324dea1e58c13c89bf41dbc873ad5 -->",
