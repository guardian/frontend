        "headline":"Snowden leaks: MI5 chief accused of using 'foolish self-serving rhetoric'",
        "body":"<p>A former director of public prosecutions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/nsa-shows-law-master-spying-technology\" title=\"\">has launched a strident attack on the head of MI5</a> for using \"foolish self-serving rhetoric\" to resist legitimate calls for Britain's intelligence agencies to face more scrutiny in the face of revelations about their surveillance capabilities.</p><p>Lord Macdonald QC said it was wrong for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Parker_%28MI5_officer%29\" title=\"\">Andrew Parker</a> and other senior figures in the intelligence community to argue that greater scrutiny and more transparency would affect the ability of MI5, GCHQ and MI6 to do their work.</p><p>Arguing that the existing legislation governing the services was \"anti-modern\", the peer, now a defence lawyer, said that an urgent review of the oversight regime was needed to prevent an \"an increasing subservience of democracy to the unaccountability of security power\".</p><p>Writing in the Guardian, Macdonald was responding to Parker's claim last week that stories about GCHQ's mass surveillance programmes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\">had been \"a gift to terrorists\"</a>, and that there was no need for more rigorous oversight.</p><p>The MI5's chief's views were shared by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10366097/Sir-Malcolm-Rifkind-Intelligence-agencies-should-operate-in-secret.html\" title=\"\">Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of the intelligence services committee</a>, which is supposed to provide parliamentary scutiny of the agencies.</p><p>Macdonald said Rifkind, who was in charge of GCHQ when he was foreign secretary, was \"badly compromised\" and appeared too close to the organisations he was supposed to be holding to acccount.</p><p>The laywer added that the disclosures from the whistleblower <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> had revealed \"the sickly character\" of the UK's current scrutiny regime, which needed an overhaul.</p><p>In his sharpest remarks, Macdonald said: \"Worst of all has been the argument, heavily deployed in recent days, including by Sir Malcolm himself, that any more daylight than we currently enjoy simply assists the nation's enemies.</p><p>\"Andrew Parker, the new director general of MI5, should be slower to employ this foolish, self-serving rhetoric, which naively begs a perfectly legitimate question: how should we ensure that those privileged to be granted special powers to intrude into everything that is private, serve a real public interest, rather than the dangerously false god of securitisation for its own sake?\"</p><p>Macdonald is the latest heavyweight figure to enter the debate about surveillance. His comments come at the start of a week in which the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, will begin to assess what might be done to shine more light on the work of the agencies.</p><p>Macdonald praised the way technological innovations had enhanced human knowledge and engagement, but warned this had transformed the way spies go about their business.</p><p>\"It has also meant that the spooks, who once sat in cubicles steaming open the glued-down flaps of a few dozen suspect envelopes, now have more fertile plains to furrow and the marvellous means to do it. Now they can steam open everything.</p><p>\"This blinding transformation has careered into a world where current legislation is so anti-modern that it struggles to distinguish between miniature bugs screwed into telephone ear pieces, and remote tapping from old-world, long-gone GPO exchanges,\" the peer said.</p><p>He added: \"So it seems very obvious that when it comes to surveillance and techniques of domestic spying, the law should be the master of technology. Anything else risks a spiralling out of control, an increasing subservience of democracy to the unaccountability of security power. This means, at the very least, that as technologies develop, parliament should consider afresh the rules that govern their use by state agencies.\"</p><p>Macdonald said nobody seemed to know which laws permitted spies \"access to everything\" and that the ISC should never again \"be led by someone whom the public might perceive as having an axe to grind or an interest to defend. Not the least of the inadequacies exposed by fallout from the Snowden revelations has been the sickly character of parliamentary oversight of the security agencies, even after recent reforms.\"</p><p>He criticised the intelligence and security committee for conducting an apparently cursory inquiry, saying that its decision to go \"into brief private session, only to emerge blinking into the daylight with protestations of apparent fealty towards the security services is a very poor substitute for grown-up scrutiny.</p><p>\"Co-option is not a uniquely British problem, but it surely is underlined when, amazingly, the ISC is chaired by Sir Malcolm Rifkind – who was once himself responsible for MI6 as foreign secretary.\"</p><p></p><p>Macdonald made clear he has no truck with those who believe the state could do without intelligence agencies, and he said transparency had to have its limits. He described the \"Julian Assange philosophy\" of full disclosure of state secrets and documents as \"a childish stamp of the feet\".</p><p>But he added that the trust the public had in the agencies was in danger of being eroded unless the weaknesses in the laws and in the scrutiny regimes were addressed, writing: \"Nothing could be more damaging to this public support than a notion that, in pursuing a broadening vocation, the spies somehow find themselves squinting through lenses not just at the villains, but at the rest of us too.\"</p><p>Files leaked by Snowden show the British eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency, have developed capabilities to undertake mass surveillance of the web and mobile phone networks. This is done by trawling the servers of internet companies and collecting raw data from the undersea cables that carry web traffic.</p><p>Two of the programmes, Prism and Tempora, can sweep up vast amounts of private data, which is shared between the two countries.</p><p>The Guardian recently revealed how GCHQ and the NSA have also successfully cracked much of the online encryption relied upon by hundreds of millions of businesses and individuals to protect their privacy.</p><p>The arguments over Snowden's leaks reached a new peak last week with Parker's speech – the first he has made since he took over MI5 six months ago.</p><p>Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, told the Guardian a fortnight ago its stories about UK surveillance had done enormous damage to national security.</p><p>However, the business secretary, Vince Cable, said last Friday the Guardian had done a great public service by revealing broad details about the extent of the UK's surveillance programmes.</p><p>Over the last fortnight a former member of parliament's intelligence and security committee, Lord King, a former director of GCHQ, and a former director general of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, have questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419920777|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|52524df6f0708829d3e8ad667eba054b2cc516e7 -->",

        "headline":"MI5 chief's condemnation of Snowden GCHQ leaks backed by David Cameron",
        "body":"<p>David Cameron has endorsed  a speech by Andrew Parker in which the new head of MI5 suggested that the leaks by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden had undermined the fight against terrorism.</p><p>The No 10 spokesman said: \"The prime minister thinks it was an excellent speech and we are, as you would expect, always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute to keeping our country safe.\"</p><p>Parker did not mention Snowden by name in a speech that defended Britain's intelligence agencies. But his remarks appeared to be aimed at the whistleblower who gave thousands of intelligence files to the Guardian that revealed surveillance programmes carried out by GCHQ and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA).</p><p>Alan Rusbridger, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, defended the newspaper's reporting of files leaked by Snowden that highlighted formidable technologies \"beyond what Orwell could have imagined\".</p><p>Rusbridger told The World at One on BBC Radio 4: \"If you read the whole of Andrew Parker's speech it is a perfectly reasonable speech and it is what you would expect him to say. If you are on the security side of the argument you want to keep everything secret, you don't want a debate and you don't want the press or anyone else writing about it. But MI5 cannot be the only voice in this debate.\"</p><p>Rusbridger challenged Parker's claim that the leaking and publication of the NSA files posed a risk to national security. He said: \"Glenn Greenwald [the Guardian journalist who received the leaked documents] has a phrase that you would have to be a terrorist who didn't know how to tie his shoelace not to believe that people were watching things on the internet and scooping up telephone calls. I don't think some of this will come as a great surprise to terrorists.</p><p>\"But what is significantly new about what we have been revealing is the extent to which entire populations are now being potentially put under surveillance. I have just spent a week in America where everybody is talking about this from the president down.\"</p><p>Rusbridger warned of attempts in the US to prevent reporting. \"There has to be a balance. There have been instances in the last few months where people have gone through metadata to find out reporters' sources&nbsp;… These technologies are formidable. They are beyond what Orwell could have imagined.</p><p>\"It may be that everything in a social democracy is fine and the oversight is working. But I would be very surprised if the current oversight methods really understood and knew about some of the things we have been describing as a result of the Snowden revelations.\"</p><p>In his speech the MI5 head defended the work of GCHQ and warned of the dangers of publishing documents which reveal some of its systems. Parker said: \"We are facing an international threat and GCHQ provides many of the intelligence leads upon which we rely. It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists.</p><p>\"It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.\"</p><p>Asked whether Cameron agreed with Parker that the leak of the Snowden files had been a gift to potential terrorists, the No 10 spokesman said: \"I would happily point you to all parts of the director general's speech. It was an excellent speech.\"</p><p>Asked whether the prime minister's endorsement covered Parker's claim that making public GCHQ's techniques provided \"the gift they [terrorists] need to evade us\", the spokesman said: \"Including that\".</p><p>The spokesman's remarks suggest Cameron agrees with MI5 that the government should try and revive the data communications bill, which has been dubbed the snooper's charter. The proposed legislation was blocked by Nick Clegg.</p><p>Asked whether Parker's remarks showed that the bill was not dead, the spokesman said: \"The position hasn't changed. The government continues to consider how best we continue to ensure our intelligence agencies, our law enforcement agencies are able to stay up to date in what is – in one of the points Andrew Parker was making – a continually evolving technological environment.\"</p><p>A Guardian News and Media spokeswoman said: \"A huge number of people - from President Obama to the US director of national intelligence, James Clapper - have now conceded that the Snowden revelations have prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue.</p><p>\"The president has even set up a review panel and there have been vigorous discussions in the US Congress and throughout Europe. Such a debate is only worthwhile if it is informed. That is what journalism should do.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419480074|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|aa6d2dcd87e8ea35dd2ab55c499cce93a81fe798 -->",

Kucherena has been the only channel to Snowden since the 30-year-old whistleblower left the airport, and has refused to give any details about his location, citing security concerns. Snowden is wanted in the US on espionage charges.</p><p></p><p>\"I am his father, I love my son and ... I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son,\" said Lon Snowden in brief remarks to Russian television crews at the airport. \"I&nbsp;am not sure my son will be returning to the US again,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Edward Snowden <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/23/edward-snowden-leaves-hong-kong-moscow\" title=\"\">arrived in Moscow on a flight from Hong Kong in June</a> and apparently intended to board an onward flight bound for Latin America. However, US authorities cancelled his passport and he remained stuck at the airport for five weeks, before Russia granted him political asylum.</p><p></p><p>On Thursday, Lon Snowden spoke of his \"extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free\", words that were run repeatedly during the morning on Russian news channels.</p><p></p><p>President Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB spy, does not have much sympathy for whistleblowers and has described Snowden as \"a strange guy\", but said that Russia had no choice but to offer him asylum.</p><p></p><p>Before Snowden was given asylum, Putin said that Russia would offer it only on the condition that the whistleblower stopped his leaks. Lon Snowden said on Thursday he understood his son had not been involved in the publication of new information since his arrival in Russia and is \"simply trying to remain healthy and safe\".</p><p></p><p>Some have suggested it is likely that Snowden is being held under guard of the FSB, Russia's security service, but the Russians have insisted that they have neither received, nor attempted to extract, any of Snowden's secrets.</p><p></p><p>Kucherena has previously said that Snowden does have security, but declined to say whether it is provided by the Russian state or a private firm. He said that Snowden has been able to travel around Russia without being recognised and is busy reading books about the country's history and learning the language.</p><p></p><p>The website Life News, which has close links to the Russian security services, published <a href=\"http://lifenews.ru/#!news/120557\" title=\"\">what it claimed was the first photo of Edward Snowden in Russia</a> earlier this week, which showed a man resembling the former NSA contractor wheeling a supermarket trolley piled with plastic bags of shopping. There has been no confirmation that the photograph is genuine.</p><p></p><p>Kucherena said that Lon Snowden planned to hold a press conference \"soon\", and added that other members of the Snowden family plan to visit Moscow in the near future.</p><p></p><p>Four US whistleblowers who have met Snowden in Russia were on Thursday reported to have said that he is settling into life in the country and has no regrets about his actions. One of them, former NSA executive Thomas Drake, says he believes that Snowden \"is making the best of his circumstances and is living as normally as possible.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419560241|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|a3b4d77f41417aa5467ddd22b016017584f88582 -->",

        "body":"<p>The first verified photograph of Edward Snowden in Russia has appeared, showing the NSA whistleblower  meeting four former US government officials who presented him with an award for \"integrity in intelligence\".</p><p>The picture appeared hours after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/edward-snowden-father-arrives-russia-moscow\" title=\"\">Snowden's father landed in Moscow</a> and said he hoped to visit his son, who has not been seen in public since he was granted asylum in Russia in August. Snowden, who leaked information about US surveillance programmes to the Guardian, was given the right to remain in Russia for a year after spending five weeks in limbo at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport over the summer. He is wanted in the US on espionage charges. Lon Snowden arrived at the same airport early on Thursday morning and was escorted through the VIP terminal by Anatoly Kucherena, his son's lawyer.</p><p>\"I am his father, I love my son and … I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son,\" said Lon Snowden in brief remarks to Russian television crews at the airport. \"I am not sure my son will be returning to the US again,\" he said. As of Thursday evening, the two had not met, but the elder Snowden told journalists he expected a meeting to take place soon. Kucherena said that other members of the Snowden family planned to visit Moscow in the near future.</p><p>Edward Snowden arrived in Moscow on a flight from Hong Kong in June and apparently intended to board an onward flight bound for Latin America. However, US authorities cancelled his passport and he remained stuck at the airport for five weeks, before Russia granted him political asylum.</p><p>On Thursday, Lon Snowden spoke of his \"extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free\", and later thanked President Vladimir Putin and Kucherena during an interview with state-controlled Russian television.</p><p>Putin, himself a former KGB spy, does not have much sympathy for whistleblowers and has described Snowden as \"a strange guy\", but said that Russia had no choice but to offer him asylum, provided the whistleblower agreed to stop his leaks. Lon Snowden said he understood his son had not been involved in the publication of new information since his arrival in Russia and was \"simply trying to remain healthy and safe\".</p><p>Some have suggested it is likely that Snowden is being held under guard of the FSB, Russia's security service, but the Russians have insisted that they have neither received, nor attempted to extract, any of Snowden's secrets.</p><p>The four former US government officials who met Snowden said he was in good spirits and dismissed claims that he was in any way restricted by the Russian government. He was presented with the Sam Adams award for integrity in intelligence, which has been given yearly since 2002, when it was award to Coleen Rowley, the former FBI agent who before the 9/11 attacks denounced the agency's failure to investigate suggestions that Islamist militants were targeting the US. In 2010, the award was given to Wikileaks and Julian Assange.</p><p>\"He spoke very openly about a whole range of things, a number of which I won't get into here, but it certainly didn't involve any kind of manipulation by the Russian government or anyone else for that matter,\" Jesselyn Radack, formerly of the US justice department and now with an organisation that protects whistleblowers, told the Associated Press. \"He definitely is his own person and makes his own decisions and says and does what he wants to.\" She and others present at the meeting refused to disclose where it had taken place.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419638671|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|420ef9a811f0d1897e8cef5b68ea4e2d2ce54f16 -->",

        "body":"<p>Lavabit&rsquo;s founder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/interactive/2013/oct/11/lavabit-brief-pdf\">has filed the opening brief in his appeal</a> against a court order forcing him to turn over the keys to his secure email service&rsquo;s encryption.</p> <p>Ladar Levison, who set up Lavabit in 2004, was commanded to turn over the encryption keys in electronic format by the district court for the eastern district of Virginia. When he refused, the court found him in contempt, and instituted a fine of $5,000 a day until he complied.</p> <p>Levison handed over the data, but closed his business to protect his customers&rsquo; information. &ldquo;The government would still be able to use Lavabit's private keys to decrypt and access data that it had already intercepted (including customers' usernames, passwords, and the contents of their emails),&rdquo; the appeal details, &ldquo;but Lavabit was forbidden from communicating this security breach to its customers or business partners.&rdquo;</p> <p>The appeal which followed rests on three arguments. &ldquo;First, the government is bereft of any statutory authority to command the production of Lavabit's private keys &hellip; Second, the Fourth Amendment independently prohibited what the government did here &hellip; Finally, the grand jury subpoena was oppressive, unduly burdensome, and ought to have been quashed.&rdquo;</p> <p>Speaking before the appeal was filed, Levison said &ldquo;I just think it&rsquo;s important &hellip; to understand that even though this investigation was over one person, [the government was] doing two things: it was [not only] demanding information which belonged to the user, but [also information which] belonged to the business.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like they were asking for a photocopy of my tax return: this was highly sensitive information which belonged to my business, and it was going to provide access to everyone and everything going over my network.</p> <p>&ldquo;From a security standard, that&rsquo;s just game over. How can you protect a network if they&rsquo;re able to see everything that comes over&nbsp;it?&rdquo;</p> <p>Although he is unable to specify who the targets of the investigation were, Levison said \"I only know about a small number, but it was more than one. What the press is focusing on is one particular investigation. But they had more than one investigation simultaneously.\" Edward Snowden, the NSA leaker, used the Lavabit service, and is believed to be the principal focus of the investigation.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Levison revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/09/lavabit-metadata-log-3500-offer\">he had attempted to forestall the government&rsquo;s request</a> for his private keys by offering to log metadata himself.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419685186|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|a7c223313700d6103b67003dd8e7d1543dc4d76c -->",

        "body":"<p>The Guardian has shown \"extraordinary naivety and arrogance\" over the publication of articles based on NSA documents leaked by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw has said.</p><p>Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time of the Iraq war in 2003, said the Guardian was wrong to assume that it could judge whether details from the files would pose a threat to anyone's security. The Guardian has said that it is taking care not to publish documents that would threaten national security or the security of individuals.</p><p>The former foreign secretary told the BBC: \"I'm not suggesting for a moment anybody in the Guardian gratuitously wants to risk anybody's life. But what I do think is that their sense of power of having these secrets and excitement – almost adolescent excitement – about these secrets has gone to their head.</p><p>\"They're blinding themselves about the consequence and also showing an extraordinary naivety and arrogance in implying that they are in a position to judge whether or not particular secrets which they have published are not likely to damage the national interest, and they're not in any position at all to do that.\"</p><p>The remarks by Straw reflect the claim by Oliver Robbins, the cabinet office's deputy national security adviser, that apparently innocuous information in the leaked files could be helpful to terrorists. David Cameron said on Thursday that the Guardian has \"on some occasions\" acknowledged the sensitivity of the material it holds.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419720276|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|d55c202009645ba2384aeb0b13b3c6606c395ed4 -->",

        "body":"<p>The behaviour of much of the British press over the last week has been bewilderingly inconsistent. Papers that are against the power of the state as a defining editorial principle have swung behind the government and MI5 to attack the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/guardian-democracy-editors\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian</em>'s publication </a>of the Snowden leaks and have come close to calling for the paper's prosecution. The <em>Daily Mail</em>, which once fiercely opposed the erosion of liberties under the Labour government, now finds itself in the curious position of not only vilifying journalism but supporting the state's right to carry out blanket surveillance of everyone's communications.</p><p>On the one hand, the <em>Mail</em> and others on the right of centre passionately resist the role of the state (most recently in regulating newspapers), but on the other are relaxed about a massive extension of the state's power over individuals' lives. In normal circumstances, this would incur the wrath of those papers. But these are not normal circumstances and so the state is privileged, in this instance, over the individual. Funny, that.</p><p>At no stage have these news organisations acknowledged that Snowden's disclosures should prompt an urgent debate on the balance between liberty and security, as they have done in the US, where President Obama has conceded the need for an overhaul of the National Security Agency's surveillance programmes. And James Clapper, director of National Intelligence in the US, has said that \"some of the debate needed to happen\"'.</p><p>But last week there was precious little interest in hosting a debate. There was no shade, nuance or complexity on view. Instead, some newspapers pursued what looked decidedly like a grudge against the <em>Guardian</em>, resentful at that paper's role in the phone-hacking scandal that led to the Leveson inquiry. It is unfortunate that British journalism is unable to distinguish between our own interests and a matter of principle that affects all our readers. Using the Snowden revelations as an excuse to grind old axes doesn't serve Britons or Britain very well.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419752050|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|a3cbc17bc8396f24c4d1dc973523cfae7b2ee790 -->",

        "headline":"US fears back-door routes into the net because it's building them too",
        "body":"<p>At a remarkable conference held at the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoWkAVXmSs0&amp;list=PLAA814AFEFEDD7F49&amp;index=13\" title=\"\">Aspen Institute in 2011</a>, General Michael Hayden, a former head of both the NSA and the CIA, said something very interesting. In a discussion of how to secure the \"critical infrastructure\" of the United States he described the phenomenon of compromised computer hardware – namely, chips that have hidden \"back doors\" inserted into them at the design or manufacturing stage – as \"the problem from hell\". And, he went on, \"frankly, it's not a problem that can be solved\".</p><p>Now General Hayden is an engaging, voluble, likable fellow. He's popular with the hacking crowd because he doesn't talk like a government suit. But sometimes one wonders if his agreeable persona is actually a front for something a bit more disingenuous.  Earlier in the Aspen discussion, for example, he talked about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\" title=\"\">Stuxnet worm</a> – which was used to destroy centrifuges in the Iranian nuclear programme – as something that was obviously created by a nation-state, but affected not to know that the US was one of the nation-states involved.</p><p>Given Hayden's background and level of security clearance, it seems inconceivable that he didn't know who built Stuxnet. So already one had begun to take his contributions with a modicum of salt. Nevertheless, his observation about the intractability of the problem of compromised hardware seemed incontrovertible. This is because covertly modified hardware is hard to detect – much more so than dodgy software. The hardware in a computer can do things like access data in ways that are completely invisible even to the machine's security software. At the Black Hat security conference in August last year, for example, a researcher named Jonathan Brossard <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428652/a-computer-infection-that-can-never-be-cured/\" title=\"\">demonstrated software that can be burned into the hardware of a PC</a>, creating a back door that would allow secret remote access over the internet. And – here's the really scary bit – the secret entrance couldn't even be closed by switching off the computer's hard disk or reinstalling its operating system.</p><p>The reason this is so scary is because virtually every bit of kit that runs the internet – the machine on which you compose your emails, the tablet or smartphone with which you browse the net, the routers that pass on the data packets that comprise your email or your web search, everything – is a computer. So the thought that all this stuff might covertly be compromised in ways that are impossible to detect is terrifying.  It's this fear that underpins <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/429542/why-the-united-states-is-so-afraid-of-huawei/\" title=\"\">American (and British) reservations</a> about network products made by the Chinese company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/18/huawei-cyber-security-investigaton-kim-darroch\" title=\"\">Huawei</a> – the suspicions (vehemently denied by Huawei, of course) that the kit has secret back doors installed in it to facilitate the Chinese's cyber-army's penetration of western networks.</p><p>So Hayden was right: it is a problem from hell. If the hardware that runs the internet has been polluted or infiltrated then we're all screwed, because there's no bit of cyberspace you can trust. And I know, I know: it sounds like paranoia – until you discover that Darpa, the research arm of the US department of defence (DoD), has launched a massive research project into compromised hardware.</p><p>The department's growing dependence on the global supply chain, <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/newsevents/releases/2012/11/30.aspx\" title=\"\">it says</a>, \"makes device, software and firmware security an imperative. Back doors, malicious software and other vulnerabilities unknown to the user could enable an adversary to use a device to accomplish a variety of harmful objectives, including the exfiltration [extraction] of sensitive data and the sabotage of critical operations. Determining the security of every device DoD uses in a timely fashion is beyond current capabilities.\"</p><p>At this point we enter a Kafkaesque world of smoke and mirrors. Because one of the most obvious inferences from the Snowden revelations published by the <em>Guardian</em>, <em>New York Times</em> and <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption\" title=\"\">ProPublica recently</a> is that the NSA has indeed been up to the business of inserting covert back doors in networking and other computing kit.</p><p>The reports say that, in addition to undermining all of the mainstream cryptographic software used to protect online commerce, the NSA has been \"collaborating with technology companies in the United States and abroad to build entry points into their products\".</p><p>These reports have, needless to say, been strenuously denied by the companies, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/cisco\" title=\"\">Cisco</a>, that make this networking kit. Perhaps the NSA omitted to tell Darpa what it was up to?  In the meantime, I hear that some governments have decided that their embassies should no longer use electronic communications at all, and are returning to employing couriers who travel the world handcuffed to locked dispatch cases. We're back to the future, again.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419630598|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|acbc60330f8458f51a72cd10caa1dd94398f5e9f -->",

        "headline":"New York Times's Jill Abramson: 'The First Amendment is first for a reason'",
        "body":"<p>For a newspaper that has yet to put a great deal of marketing muscle behind its international presence, the New York Times isn't doing so badly. A third of its 59 million unique monthly users live outside the US, making it one of the most widely read news sites in the world – even before it really tries.</p><p>On Tuesday that effort to advance the paper's global reach begins in earnest with the launch of the International New York Times, an integrated digital and print venture designed to push the Times's revered journalism to a worldwide audience. Edited in Paris, Hong Kong and New York, it will build upon the foundations of the International Herald Tribune, the 126-year-old title that will cease to exist, ten years after the NYT bought out its partner for the previous 35 years, the Washington Post.</p><p>For Jill Abramson, executive editor of the New York Times, the rebranding is the culmination of a long-held ambition to create what she calls the \"24-hour global newsroom\". The new website and print edition will aim to reverse the recent flow of energy across the Atlantic that has seen UK news outlets – the Guardian and the Mail Online primarily – make inroads in the US. Now it's the turn of the Gray Lady to see whether she can turn the tide by taking on the famously cut-throat UK market.</p><p>Abramson thinks she can. \"The thirst for the quality information the New York Times provides is very real and pretty unquenchable at this point,\" she says. But what can the NYT offer British readers that they don't already get? \"Sophistication of analysis and news presentation that we do on a higher plane than anywhere else.\"</p><p>New York Times editors don't do modesty, Abramson no exception. She says her ambition for the paper is to become \"the international provider of the highest quality news and information. That simple. It's the best, so everyone is going to want that.\"</p><p>The opportunity for growth – both in readership and income – is underlined by the statistics. Only a tenth of the NYT's paid digital subscriptions of about 700,000 come from outside the US, and though Britain is its third largest web audience the UK represents only 4% of total traffic (the US accounts for 66% and Canada 5%).</p><p>Britain has been on Abramson's mind a lot over the past few months. In August, she accepted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/23/guardian-news-york-times-partnership\" title=\"\">an invitation from the Guardian </a>to join in the exploration of the files leaked by Edward Snowden, a repeat of the 2010 collaboration between the two news organisations over WikiLeaks in which she was also heavily involved.</p><p>The latest joining of forces with the Guardian earned Abramson an approach from the UK embassy in Washington. In the NYT's first official comment on the incident, she says that an embassy figure whom she does not name asked to speak to her several weeks ago. \"They were hopeful that we would relinquish any material that we might be reporting on, relating to Edward Snowden.\"</p><p>If that was an attempt to dissuade the NYT from publishing stories about GCHQ and the NSA, it didn't work. The British government had met its match in Abramson: \"Needless to say I considered what they told me, and said no.\"</p><p>There's a calm confidence to the way she relates the story that is striking, and very American. She repeats one of her favourite expressions: \"The First Amendment is first for a reason. It makes me feel a little like I'm pontificating to cite the founders of this country, but it's true they were so afraid of centralised power that they saw a free press as the critical bulwark against unbridled government – and that is our role.\"</p><p>While the First Amendment has largely shielded the NYT from the British-style threat of prior restraint, a new challenge to robust journalism has emerged in the form of President Obama's aggressive pursuit of official leakers. His administration has launched seven prosecutions under the Espionage Act, more than twice the number under all previous presidents combined.</p><p>\"That's put a chill on sources, particularly those involved in national security matters,\" she says. \"Very experienced investigative reporters in Washington have said to me the atmosphere for reporting has never been less hospitable, and that means that keeping the public informed has become more difficult. There are principled people inside the government who want to share certain information but are now too scared to talk because they fear prosecution.\"</p><p>It's not just central government that is putting pressure on news organisations by intimidating sources. Those same sources are also becoming increasingly challenging as the internet and the rise of the so-called \"Fifth Estate\" have given them a plethora of outlets to go to, from WikiLeaks to specialist blogs to even direct publication. Snowden himself made it clear that he decided not to bring his material to the New York Times because of the paper's decision back in 2005 to hold on to its story for a year into the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping programme.</p><p>Abramson says she is unfazed by that, pointing out that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">Times won a Pulitzer for the story that it did eventually publish</a>  Snowden may have seen it as a problem, but \"at the time there were considerations that caused the story to be held for a while\".</p><p>She sees no cause for existential angst in Snowden's conscious decision to go elsewhere with his leaked treasure trove. \"I'm not surprised that sources have reasons for going to certain news organisations or not, I still think that many sources still prefer to come to the New York Times because we have global impact and the rest of the news media pay acute attention to the stories we publish. I haven't seen any diminishment in that.\"</p><p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/10/07/131007fa_fact_auletta\" title=\"\">New Yorker article on the Guardian</a>, Abramson's predecessor as executive editor, Bill Keller, said that had he still been editing the New York Times, with its famed and impenetrable wall between news journalists and columnists, he would not have allowed Glenn Greenwald to have a byline on the story. In the same article, Abramson sidestepped the question of how she would have handled the role of Greenwald, a journalist and columnist for the Guardian who has led this paper's coverage of the NSA, saying she doesn't deal in hypotheticals.</p><p>This goes to the heart of one of the key questions now facing the New York Times in the melée of the digital revolution: can it hang on to its tried and tested rules when the world around it is changing so rapidly? Can regulations set in the days when newspapers were powers unto themselves still apply in the age of interaction and self-publishing, or is there a danger that the Times gets left behind because it is too rule-bound?</p><p>Again, Abramson is having no truck with this idea. \"All I can speak to is the standards that the New York Times has for the journalists on the news side. We expect them to not express opinions publicly. The New York Times has taken the view that we see a reason to have a divide between news and opinion.\"</p><p>We are sitting in Abramson's office just off the famed New York Times newsroom floor. It is a theatrically cluttered space full of her varied knickknacks, including cushions <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/books/excerpt-the-puppy-diaries-by-jill-abramson.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">embroidered with images of her beloved dogs</a>, a DVD of a BBC docudrama on Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor and, quizzically, a book titled The Married Kama Sutra.</p><p>It's been two years since Abramson became the first female editor of the New York Times, and nearly six months since she was notoriously accused by unnamed sources <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/new-york-times-turbulence-90544.html?hp=t1_3\" title=\"\">in a Politico article</a> of being \"difficult to work with\". The charge provoked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/24/jill-abramson-sexist-narrative-politico\" title=\"\">a counterblast from the media analyst Emily Bell</a> that argued such denigration was sexist.</p><p>So who was right, Politico or Bell? \"I appreciated what Emily Bell wrote and I thought the Politico story was unfair,\" she says, weighing her words carefully. Is there any truth in the line that she is a tough manager? \"I think it's not for me to say.\"</p><p>I ask her what she has been most proud of during the infancy of her editorship, and she cites the investigative reporting that has been done on global issues such as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/world/asia/china-princelings-using-family-ties-to-gain-riches.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">the rise of \"princeling\" families in China</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/ieconomy-apples-ipad-and-the-human-costs-for-workers-in-china.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">Apple's labour practices </a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/world/asia/garment-trade-wields-power-in-bangladesh.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">the textile business of Bangladesh</a>.</p><p>She also lauds the \"very vibrant multimedia form of reading\" that is now a top priority for the organisation \"where video and motion graphics and animation are embedded as an organic part of an article. This newsroom has been incredibly inventive in raising new trails.\"</p><p>That aspect of the job has brought her into close contact with the CEO of the New York Times company, former BBC director general Mark Thompson. There has been plenty of reporting in this area too, also based on anonymous sources, suggesting that relations between Abramson and Thompson are at best complicated.</p><p>In his search for a new economic model for the paper that would take it into a secure digital future, Thompson has been experimenting with innovations that appear to stray from his corporate bunker on the 16th floor of the Times building into the editorial realm. They include the creation of a team of video-makers that answers jointly to Abramson and to the company's business side.</p><p>Isn't that putting tanks on your lawn, I ask. The general manager of the video team does report jointly, she says, \"but I don't think that's having tanks on the lawn\". Who is in charge of multimedia? \"I definitely am in charge of the multimedia effort.\" She says it in such a way as to brook no dissent.</p><p>I ask her how she felt about <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/new-york-times-mark-thompson-2013-9/#print\" title=\"\">the New York magazine piece</a>  that reported Thompson saying (yes, another unidentified source) that he could be editor of the New York Times. \"I have no idea whether he said that,\" she replies diplomatically.</p><p>And if he had said it, how would she feel then? \"He can …, he has …\" Abramson shakes her head from side to side and looks to me – in my purely subjective judgment – deeply pained. Then she says: \"I don't know, I have no comment.\"</p><p>You get the impression that there's going to be more to say in future about that particular relationship. But for now the moment is Abramson's. The newsroom is buzzing, the Pulitzers are coming in, and as of tomorrow she has a whole new toy to play with that will take the formidable journalism of the New York Times to a global audience.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419740341|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|cc303cc53275e51a5bd04521f2d93c530662eaa7 -->",

        "headline":"New York Times says UK tried to get it to hand over Snowden documents",
        "body":"<p>The editor of the New York Times, Jill Abramson, has confirmed that senior British officials attempted to persuade her to hand over secret documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.</p><p>Giving the newspaper's first official comments on the incident, Abramson said that she was approached by the UK embassy in Washington after it was announced that the New York Times was collaborating with the Guardian to explore some of the files disclosed by Snowden. Among the files are several relating to the activities of GCHQ, the agency responsible for signals interception in the UK.</p><p>\"They were hopeful that we would relinquish any material that we might be reporting on, relating to Edward Snowden. Needless to say I considered what they told me, and said no,\" Abramson told the Guardian in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/13/new-york-times-jill-abramson-first-amendment\">an interview to mark the International Herald Tribune's relaunch as the International New York Times</a>.</p><p>The incident shows the lengths to which the UK government has gone to try to discourage press coverage of the Snowden leaks. In July, the government threatened to take legal action against the Guardian that could have prevented publication, culminating in the destruction of computer hard drives  containing some of Snowden's files.</p><p>Abramson said  the spectacle of angle grinders and drills being used to destroy evidence in a newspaper basement was hard to conceive in the US, where the First Amendment offers free speech guarantees. \"I can't imagine that. The only equivalent I can think of is years ago when the New York Times was enjoined by a lower court from publishing the Pentagon papers, but the supreme court came in and overruled that decision. Prior restraint is pretty much unthinkable to me in this country.\"</p><p>Abramson has been executive editor of the New York Times, America's largest and most influential newspaper, since 2011. She said that the conversation with the UK's Washington embassy was the extent so far of British attempts to influence the paper's editorial decisions in relation to Snowden.</p><p>Within the US, the Obama administration has asked on several occasions for the New York Times to consider withholding certain information from its stories, and the paper always gives sober consideration to the requests, she said, based on a careful assessment of the possible damage to national security accruing from publication. \"Our default position is usually to weigh on the side of informing the public.\"</p><p>In both the US and Britain, Abramson argued, \"there's a war on terror being waged in the name of the public, and the public has a right to have information about it. That's critical. The Guardian as well as the New York Times are providing a very valuable service, allowing people to decide for themselves whether the intelligence agencies are being too intrusive in their data collection.</p><p>\"President Obama has said he welcomes such a debate, and I think it's not only healthy but vital to have that.\"</p><p>Abramson added that she found the reaction of the Daily Mail to the series of stories published by the Guardian on the back of the Snowden leaks \"unusual to me\". On Thursday, the Mail accused the Guardian of \"lethal irresponsibility\" in revealing the vast data grab of ordinary people's phone and internet records by the NSA.</p><p>\"The political tradition is different, and British press laws are more restrictive,\" she said. \"There isn't the same acceptance or devotion to the idea that we have here: that a free press is fundamental to free society, and that the free flow of information is essential to having an informed public making decisions about how they want to be governed.\"</p><p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/oct/13/new-york-times-jill-abramson-first-amendment\">Read the full interview</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419839366|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|d537965402dcb4083031ba829ba62bacab65d677 -->",

They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely,\" Snowden said.</p><p>The videos are the first of Snowden speaking since 12 July, when the former NSA analyst was shown at a Moscow airport, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/edward-snowden-leaves-moscow-airport-live\">pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on 1 August</a>. That decision has strained relations between the US and Russia; President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Vladimir Putin at a Russia-hosted summit in September.</p><p>Snowden said the US government was \"unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they'll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth\".</p><p>In a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the US military of deliberately underestimating the enemy's strength for political purposes, and given annually by a group of retired US national security officers. </p><p>Four former US government officials who were at the ceremony told the Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419784412|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|a6b3e9966fb4d0459ebfea2edb8ad4928b278281 -->",

        "body":"<p>Where should one draw the boundaries between secrecy, openness and security? Probably not by privatising the right to publish, when it comes to the work of the security agencies. It may do for libertarians like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/22/rand-paul-republican-rising-star\" title=\"\">Rand Paul</a> to argue the state cannot be trusted with anything, so that government should be vanishingly small, and that it certainly shouldn't be permitted deep conspiratorial secrets. But it's an odd position for left-of-centre believers in the state to wish away any credible apparatus of secret intelligence. To express the blindingly obvious, it is an entirely legitimate manifestation of state power in a democratic society to have agencies that, according to strict legal limitations, are permitted to surveil and to intrude in the cause of public safety.</p><p>This is why WikiLeaks is a false prophet. And why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/14/julian-assange-philosophy-evolving-wikileaks\" title=\"\">Julian Assange's philosophy</a> – such as it exists – is a childish stamp of the feet, and deeply totalitarian. After all, elements of secrecy and discretion are an intrinsic aspect of any human life that retains its dignity. It's discomforting to consider where fundamentalists for openness might be inclined to draw the line between the public and the private, and how much human identity they'd parade in the open. Is transparency always and in all circumstances good, even when it comes to governments?</p><p>The technology of communications has changed more rapidly in the past 15 years than George Orwell imagined in his darkest writing. That television screen staring out from a bleak apartment wall at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Smith\" title=\"\">Winston Smith</a>, once so threatening and strange, suddenly seems almost comically archaic and hardly scary at all. Contrary to the central conceit of 1984, most technological change has been a headlong, manic streak not into servitude, but into a surprising upland of human knowledge and engagement.</p><p>Of course it has also meant that the spooks, who once sat in cubicles steaming open the glued-down flaps of a few dozen suspect envelopes, now have more fertile plains to furrow and the marvellous means to do it. Now they can steam open everything.</p><p></p><p>The point is that this blinding transformation has careered into a world where legislation is so anti-modern that it struggles to distinguish between miniature bugs screwed into telephone earpieces and remote tapping from old-world, long gone <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Post_Office\" title=\"\">GPO</a> exchanges. And this as we learn that GCHQ, in all its technological majesty, can scoop up every last word that passes through those sleek cables beneath the Atlantic, everything we say and every last key that our fingers stroke. So it seems obvious that when it comes to surveillance and techniques of domestic spying, the law should be the master of technology. Anything else risks an increasing subservience of democracy to the unaccountability of security power. This means, at the very least, that as technologies develop, parliament should consider afresh the rules that govern their use by state agencies.</p><p>What is the law that defines GCHQ's power over the internet; and how many warrants, and signed by whom, does it take to permit our spies access to everything? No one seems to know.</p><p>Not the least of the inadequacies exposed by fallout from the Snowden revelations has been the sickly character of parliamentary oversight of the security agencies, even after recent reforms. An intelligence and security committee that goes into brief private session, only to emerge blinking into the daylight with protestations of apparent fealty to the security services, is a poor substitute for grown-up scrutiny. Co-option is not a uniquely British problem, but it surely is underlined when, amazingly, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/20/rubbish-sir-simon-intellignence-snowden\" title=\"\">ISC is chaired by Sir Malcolm Rifkind</a> – once responsible for MI6 as foreign secretary.</p><p>He seems badly compromised, and the ISC should never again be led by someone whom the public might perceive as having an axe to grind or an interest to defend.</p><p>But worst of all has been the argument, heavily deployed in recent days, including by Sir Malcolm himself, that any more daylight than we currently enjoy simply <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/mi5-andrew-parker-different-world-shaker-aamer\" title=\"\">assists the nation's enemies</a>. Andrew Parker, the new director general of MI5, should be slower to employ this foolish, self-serving rhetoric that naively raises a perfectly legitimate question: how should we ensure that those privileged to be granted special powers to intrude into everything that is private serve a real public interest, rather than the dangerously false god of securitisation for its own sake?</p><p>There is still great trust placed in the security agencies by the mass of British people. No doubt this results from a confidence that our spooks are in the business of targeting and going after our enemies, that we are on the same side and that they work for us. But nothing could be more damaging to this public support than a notion that, in pursuing a broadening vocation, the spies somehow find themselves squinting through lenses not just at the villains, but at the rest of us too.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419921762|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|4a7162c0617cc3d2cef9465d4bb6b884da744296 -->",

        "body":"<p>A former director of public prosecutions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/nsa-shows-law-master-spying-technology\" title=\"\">has launched a strident attack on the head of MI5</a> for using \"foolish self-serving rhetoric\" to resist legitimate calls for Britain's intelligence agencies to face more scrutiny in the face of revelations about their surveillance capabilities.</p><p>Lord Macdonald QC said it was wrong for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Parker_%28MI5_officer%29\" title=\"\">Andrew Parker</a> and other senior figures in the intelligence community to argue that greater scrutiny and more transparency would affect the ability of MI5, GCHQ and MI6 to do their work.</p><p>Arguing that the existing legislation governing the services was \"anti-modern\", the peer, now a defence lawyer, said that an urgent review of the oversight regime was needed to prevent an \"an increasing subservience of democracy to the unaccountability of security power\".</p><p>Writing in the Guardian, Macdonald was responding to Parker's claim last week that stories about GCHQ's mass surveillance programmes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/gchq-surveillance-new-mi5-chief\" title=\"\">had been \"a gift to terrorists\"</a>, and that there was no need for more rigorous oversight.</p><p>The MI5's chief's views were shared by <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10366097/Sir-Malcolm-Rifkind-Intelligence-agencies-should-operate-in-secret.html\" title=\"\">Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of the intelligence services committee</a>, which is supposed to provide parliamentary scutiny of the agencies.</p><p>Macdonald said Rifkind, who was in charge of GCHQ when he was foreign secretary, was \"badly compromised\" and appeared too close to the organisations he was supposed to be holding to acccount.</p><p>The laywer added that the disclosures from the whistleblower <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> had revealed \"the sickly character\" of the UK's current scrutiny regime, which needed an overhaul.</p><p>In his sharpest remarks, Macdonald said: \"Worst of all has been the argument, heavily deployed in recent days, including by Sir Malcolm himself, that any more daylight than we currently enjoy simply assists the nation's enemies.</p><p>\"Andrew Parker, the new director general of MI5, should be slower to employ this foolish, self-serving rhetoric, which naively begs a perfectly legitimate question: how should we ensure that those privileged to be granted special powers to intrude into everything that is private, serve a real public interest, rather than the dangerously false god of securitisation for its own sake?\"</p><p>Macdonald is the latest heavyweight figure to enter the debate about surveillance. His comments come at the start of a week in which the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, will begin to assess what might be done to shine more light on the work of the agencies.</p><p>Macdonald praised the way technological innovations had enhanced human knowledge and engagement, but warned this had transformed the way spies go about their business.</p><p>\"It has also meant that the spooks, who once sat in cubicles steaming open the glued-down flaps of a few dozen suspect envelopes, now have more fertile plains to furrow and the marvellous means to do it. Now they can steam open everything.</p><p>\"This blinding transformation has careered into a world where current legislation is so anti-modern that it struggles to distinguish between miniature bugs screwed into telephone ear pieces, and remote tapping from old-world, long-gone GPO exchanges,\" the peer said.</p><p>He added: \"So it seems very obvious that when it comes to surveillance and techniques of domestic spying, the law should be the master of technology. Anything else risks a spiralling out of control, an increasing subservience of democracy to the unaccountability of security power. This means, at the very least, that as technologies develop, parliament should consider afresh the rules that govern their use by state agencies.\"</p><p>Macdonald said nobody seemed to know which laws permitted spies \"access to everything\" and that the ISC should never again \"be led by someone whom the public might perceive as having an axe to grind or an interest to defend. Not the least of the inadequacies exposed by fallout from the Snowden revelations has been the sickly character of parliamentary oversight of the security agencies, even after recent reforms.\"</p><p>He criticised the intelligence and security committee for conducting an apparently cursory inquiry, saying that its decision to go \"into brief private session, only to emerge blinking into the daylight with protestations of apparent fealty towards the security services is a very poor substitute for grown-up scrutiny.</p><p>\"Co-option is not a uniquely British problem, but it surely is underlined when, amazingly, the ISC is chaired by Sir Malcolm Rifkind – who was once himself responsible for MI6 as foreign secretary.\"</p><p></p><p>Macdonald made clear he has no truck with those who believe the state could do without intelligence agencies, and he said transparency had to have its limits. He described the \"Julian Assange philosophy\" of full disclosure of state secrets and documents as \"a childish stamp of the feet\".</p><p>But he added that the trust the public had in the agencies was in danger of being eroded unless the weaknesses in the laws and in the scrutiny regimes were addressed, writing: \"Nothing could be more damaging to this public support than a notion that, in pursuing a broadening vocation, the spies somehow find themselves squinting through lenses not just at the villains, but at the rest of us too.\"</p><p>Files leaked by Snowden show the British eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency, have developed capabilities to undertake mass surveillance of the web and mobile phone networks. This is done by trawling the servers of internet companies and collecting raw data from the undersea cables that carry web traffic.</p><p>Two of the programmes, Prism and Tempora, can sweep up vast amounts of private data, which is shared between the two countries.</p><p>The Guardian recently revealed how GCHQ and the NSA have also successfully cracked much of the online encryption relied upon by hundreds of millions of businesses and individuals to protect their privacy.</p><p>The arguments over Snowden's leaks reached a new peak last week with Parker's speech – the first he has made since he took over MI5 six months ago.</p><p>Sir David Omand, the former head of GCHQ, told the Guardian a fortnight ago its stories about UK surveillance had done enormous damage to national security.</p><p>However, the business secretary, Vince Cable, said last Friday the Guardian had done a great public service by revealing broad details about the extent of the UK's surveillance programmes.</p><p>Over the last fortnight a former member of parliament's intelligence and security committee, Lord King, a former director of GCHQ, and a former director general of MI5, Dame Stella Rimington, have questioned whether the agencies need to be more transparent and accept more rigorous scrutiny of their work.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419920777|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|52524df6f0708829d3e8ad667eba054b2cc516e7 -->",
