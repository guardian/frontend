        "headline":"The Dominican Republic and Haiti: one island riven by an unresolved past",
        "body":"<p>When Haiti was hit by the devastating earthquake in 2010, its island neighbour, the Dominican Republic, rushed to help. It was among the first to send rescue workers, food and water, and also allowed overseas relief agency flights to land at Santo Domingo airport.</p><p>But three years on, the goodwill seems to have dissipated and old tensions resurfaced. Just over a week ago <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-26/world/42423002_1_haitian-migrants-dominicans-citizenship\" title=\"\">the Dominican Republic's highest court ruled to revoke the citizenship of children of illegal Haitian migrant workers</a> – a measure to be applied to anyone born after 1929, and thus affecting not only migrants' children, but their grandchildren and, in some cases, even great-grandchildren.</p><p>This is the latest legal attack on the rights of Haitians and their descendants; measures in the past few years have included reclassifying migrant workers as \"in transit\" rather than legal residents. This meant any child born in the Dominican Republic – which had been one basis for citizenship – also needed one Dominican parent, or one who was a legal resident.</p><p></p><p>The latest ruling could leave thousands who identify themselves as Dominican but may have had a Haitian ancestor facing an uncertain future – already some 40,000 people have been told they will not receive identity documents. Without official papers, it is impossible to access services such as schools or healthcare. Human rights groups and local NGOs have expressed their concern, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/09/30/3662097/un-will-review-dominican-ruling.html\" title=\"\">and the UN will be reviewing this ruling</a>.</p><p>Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola, where Christopher Columbus established the first European settlement in 1492. Despite their shared history of colonialism and slavery, dictatorship and oppression, a physical and emotional border has long separated them.</p><p>The western third of the island was ceded by Spain to France in 1697, and the entire island by 1795. By 1801 the famed former slave General Toussaint Louverture had freed all the slaves on the island and united it under his governorship, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/600902/Toussaint-Louverture\" title=\"\">though this was short-lived</a>.</p><p>In 1808, a group of Dominicans started  the war of reconquest to drive out the French and return the eastern part the island to Spanish rule – the west by this point was the republic of Haiti. But by 1822  Haiti had established control of the whole island once more. Indeed, the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1217771.stm\" title=\"\">Dominican Republic gained its independence</a> from Haiti, not Spain, in 1844.</p><p>Modern times have been no less complicated. In 1937, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo – who wore makeup to lighten his skin and was obsessed with \"whitening\" the predominantly mixed-race island – ordered the massacre of Haitians in border areas, where many worked cultivating sugar. To determine who was Haitian, soldiers with machetes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19880967\" title=\"\">asked dark-skinned people to say the word \"perejil\"</a>, which is Spanish for parsley. For Creole-speaking Haitians, the \"r\" sound was difficult to pronounce, and a slip of the tongue became a death sentence. Estimates of the massacre range from 10,000 to 25,000 people killed over the course of a few weeks. And the bitter irony was that Trujillo's grandmother was Haitian.</p><p>Today the border continues to inspire fear. Dominican-born children of Haitian descent number around 210,000, in a nation of 10 million. Haitians have long been migrant workers,  with many finding seasonal employment in sugar cane fields or other low-wage work, which has become especially crucial in the aftermath of the earthquake. And, like immigrants elsewhere, they are often blamed for taking jobs. At the same time, racialised fears of \"Haitianisation\" are still regularly voiced by politicians and sections of the media, though many Dominicans have expressed shock and anger over the court's decision. But violence is still directed at Haitians; crimes against them often go unreported; <a href=\"http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?NoCache=1&amp;Dato=20130927&amp;Kategori=NEWS&amp;Lopenr=309270154&amp;Ref=AR\" title=\"\">and many continue to live in dire poverty</a>.</p><p>Deportations of workers who have no chance to appeal are common – the Dominican military reported it sent away some <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dominican-ruling-strips-citizenship-20387587\" title=\"\">47,700 Haitians in the past year, up from 21,000 the year before</a>. And now tens of thousands of people who consider themselves Dominicans face a one-way trip to a country where they cannot speak the language, may not have any family, and face extreme economic hardship. The Haitian government  said it \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/haiti-strongly-disagrees-with-dominican-ruling-that-strips-citizenship-of-immigrant-children/2013/10/05/b07141be-2dee-11e3-b141-298f46539716_story.html\" title=\"\">strongly disagrees</a>\" with the decision and <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/01/3663924/haiti-recalls-envoy-activists.html\" title=\"\">has recalled its ambassador to the Dominican Republic</a> for consultations on the implications of the ruling.</p><p>Anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic reaches back decades, if not centuries; unacknowledged and institutionalised, it has been manipulated and put to political use. Rather than being united by their shared histories, the two sides of Hispaniola remain riven by an unresolved past. It is not yet clear how this ruling will be turned into policy, but in facing such an uncertain future, these Dominicans also carry with them a heavy burden of the past.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419097404|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|0acbe9f306cf8a7da093f3e424e570a4b7a661fc -->",

The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-special-forces-libya-somalia\" title=\"\">US attacks on Somalia and Libya </a>over the weekend were against lawless parts of the world that harbour dangerous people intent, so we are told, on causing mayhem outside their borders. Someone needs to deal with them. Yet both these countries have been subject to massive western intervention, supposedly to set them on the path to democracy and good order. As with the failed Somalian kidnap, something went wrong there too.</p><p>The attempt to curb international violence is taking ever newer forms. In Britain the centralisation of crime-fighting has been a bad joke for years, as the Home Office invents one \"British FBI\" after another. It has splurged money on bureaucrats, while the frontline is cut back. This week the government has invented yet another body, the £450m <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/national-crime-agency-theresa-may-europol-keith-bristow\" title=\"\">National Crime Agency</a>, with the crass motto \"We instil fear\".</p><p>The reality is that ordinary policing of terrorism in most European countries has a decent record. There have been no serious terrorist massacres in Britain since 2005. The US seems equally safe. The stories that have emerged suggest this is largely the result of local tip-offs and good intelligence work rather than any drastic extension of police powers or global derring-do.</p><p>All the best police work is local. The best tip-offs are local, the best knowledge is local. It was a failure of local intelligence in Pakistan that meant it took the Americans more than a decade to find Osama bin Laden. The future of western security lies not in the courage of special forces or the deployment of drone squadrons and snatch squads. It lies in dogged police work, and in not provoking or abusing the sovereignty of countries that may so readily offer refuge and support to terrorists.</p><p>If one thing has been proved beyond a doubt, the surest way to endanger the west is to proliferate the hamfisted interventions that have made Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere a ready refuge for those who want to take revenge on westerners. To go crashing about the world arresting and doubtless mistreating suspects is a desperate throw. It makes good headlines but it does no good.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419231327|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|6244f478e0598040079f458cf1133707ddb62b06 -->",

        "headline":"Is Buddhism a religion?",
        "body":"<p>What first attracted me to Buddhism in the years that followed my slow abandonment of formal Christianity wasn't anything intellectual but had to do rather with imagination, with images of liberation. I was struck by the serenity of the figure of the Buddha, its representation of self-possession and calm. There was danger there, the temptation towards a too-easy and precipitate appropriation of a demeanour that depended upon arduous and sometimes unappetising struggle. Nevertheless, Buddhism was attractive and it seemed to be a way of rediscovering something that seemed to be missing, without requiring an entrance fee in the form of religious or metaphysical belief.</p><p>I suppose that what was missing was \"spirituality\". But this raises the question of whether \"spirituality\" can be extricated from those belief-commitments. Some commentators have pointed out that there is no shortage of metaphysical beliefs in the Buddhist traditions and that its practices and rituals are embedded in worldviews of some complexity and sophistication. They wonder whether Buddhist practices really can be extracted from this environment without damage to their identity, whether the Buddhisms to be found in the contemporary west have become deracinated, cut off from the necessary nourishment of their cultural and metaphysical roots. It may well look like this. Thus, people attest to the therapeutic value of meditation and the NHS is more comfortable with a mindfulness-based psychotherapy than one that makes use of the Christian practice of prayer because it is an efficacious technique with measurable health benefits and it is not \"religious\". Clients don't need a background of religious belief in order to settle down to a spot of meditation.</p><p>Some contemporary groups go out of their way to insist that Buddhism is not \"religious\" and what they seem to imply is, again, that engaging in its practices doesn't depend upon the belief-subscription. These same groups, however, are also quite traditional in their language and their rituals and this should give us pause as we consider this charge of deracination. It is true that many contemporary Buddhist practitioners have done the same de-mythologising job as a previous generation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/oct/04/death-god-theology-elson\" title=\"\">Death of God theologians</a> who were themselves accused of rendering the New Testament into an inoffensive and pallid humanism.</p><p>But it is one thing to seek to liberate Buddhist practice from unsustainable or unbelievable worldviews and another to reduce it to a mere technique, even one that is therapeutic. The usual culprit is the calming technique that makes it easier to carry out the bombing run or makes one a more sharply predatory capitalist. The reason one might want to say that meditation has been reduced to a technique is that it has lost its essential rootedness as a practice of ethical preparation.</p><p>It is traditional to distinguish forms or aspects of meditation in terms of what calms the egocentric or the communal passions and to say that this prepares the practitioner for the essential Buddhist experience of enlightenment or awakening. Now one of the temptations of former Christians is to think that what they might find in Buddhism is some kind of transcendent experience. But this seems too much like nostalgia for God. If there is any kind of transcendence in Buddhism it is a matter of transcending ego-centric self-enclosure. The calming of the passions that Buddhism is interested in is the calming that reduces the dominance of those self-interested feelings that prevent one from seeing what is staring one in the face: one's own real condition and that of others. One is surrounded by the real world but is too preoccupied to notice it.</p><p>In that case Buddhist practice becomes a form of ethical preparation, reducing the forms of self-preoccupation that impede a concern for justice. This aspect of Buddhism has led some commentators to say that it is more like a philosophy of life than a religion. This contrast with religion relies too heavily on the assimilation of religion to religious belief and it neglects the ceremonial and ritual and community-building aspects of the various religions, including Buddhism.</p><p>More positively, though, thinking of Buddhism as a philosophy brings it into dialogue with the ancient conception of philosophy, one of whose essential components was precisely what was called spiritual practice or exercise, the various ways in which one is able to liberate oneself from illusion and make oneself better capable of ethical action and, of course, the ethical refusal to act. It is worth noting that the ancient philosophers tried to live in communities and one can think of a philosophical community, whether instantiated in a Christian congregation, a Buddhist sangha, a humanist group, as serving to protect and support the conditions for that undeluded perception of the world from which issues moral action.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419071811|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|5950f7f64a14d289f306b51ee4764ab5906e2563 -->",

        "headline":"Kenya terror attack: corruption wasn't to blame",
        "body":"<p>It was difficult to read Giles Foden's article squarely blaming the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/westgate-mall-attacks\" title=\"\">attack on the Westgate mall in Nairobi</a> on alleged inadequacies of the Kenyan government and, as he puts it \"rampant corruption\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/23/kenya-behind-terror-rampant-corruption\" title=\"\">Behind terror is corruption</a>, 24 September). The Kenyan military led the operation to free hostages and kill or capture those who had trapped them, and we are proud of the professionalism and determination of our forces.</p><p>Foden says: \"In Kenya crime and terrorism are deeply linked, not least by the failure of successive Kenyan governments to control either.\" And he continues: \"These attacks are part of a spectrum of banditry, with corruption at one end, terrorism at the other, and regular robbery in the middle.\"</p><p>Make a brief comparison with other terrorist attacks. The disasters of 9/11 or the more recent Boston marathon in the US and 7/7 in the UK – both highly developed countries – could hardly be blamed on corruption, so why Kenya? We do not recall Foden blaming corruption within the security agencies involved.</p><p>\"A lot of money has gone into commercial property, and particularly the building of supermarkets. But without governance it all looks very shaky,\" says Foden. But he seems unaware of how much Kenya has changed in the past decade. The country's first truly free and fair multiparty election only took place in 2002, and since then the country has been transformed by a new constitution that gives power to all communities. Less than 10 years ago we introduced free primary education, now over a million children a year go to school.</p><p>Judicial reform, in some cases supported by international experts and donors – including the US and UK – has put the courts out of the political influence that once was common. Anti-corruption campaigns by government and civil society, the requirement for open tenders for government contracts, and the development of a lively media, have transformed the country.</p><p>This is not to say Kenya is perfect – far from it. A multinational forensic investigation currently under way – including with British agents – will examine the tragedy and assess the government's response to it. It shows the extent of our openness that we allow foreign security forces to share in an investigation we could probably manage ourselves.</p><p>At the same time, we will strive to be as open as possible in our actions against al-Qaida and its regional ally al-Shabaab in the coming months, without compromising the security of our country and the safety of our military personnel.</p><p>It is important that there is responsible international reporting. In this age of budget cuts in the international media there are too few foreign journalists with expert experience of Africa living in and reporting from the continent. Kenya suffered a terrible tragedy at Westgate. As information is released in the coming days and weeks, it is crucial – for the sake of the victims and the survivors – that reporting reflects the Kenya of today, and that we are judged by today's reality, not memories of a Kenya past.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419179702|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|c901cea9524b5e92007fdd021d4192c861c34d1f -->",

        "headline":"Women: naked realities",
        "body":"<p>Barely a week goes by without a row over whether women should take their clothes off, keep them on or be allowed to cover up completely. Last week, singer Sinéad O'Connor became the latest to offer a view, writing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-prostitute-warns-sinead-oconnor\" title=\"\">an open letter to teen sensation Miley Cyrus</a> advising her not to be so frequently or conspicuously naked lest she allow the music business to act as her \"pimp\".</p><p>On university campuses this term, student unions have been attempting to hold back what they see as a tide of casual misogyny by banning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/20/robin-thicke-blurred-lines-ban\" title=\"\">Robin Thicke's hit Blurred Lines</a>, with lyrics described by one critic as \"rapey\".</p><p>The campaign to persuade the Sun newspaper to drop its topless models has, by contrast, studiously avoided talk of a ban. <a href=\"http://nomorepage3.org/\" title=\"\">No More Page Three</a> wants Rupert Murdoch voluntarily to put the naked \"lovelies\" out of their misery. Nevertheless, the campaigners have been hampered by many public figures immediately assuming that to voice disapproval of Page 3 might associate them with an illiberal wish to introduce censorship.</p><p>Might our nervousness about returning to the days when the lord chancellor could stride on to the stage to stop an objectionable play have made us too tolerant of publishers, musicians and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10355275/Grand-Theft-Auto-V-is-designed-deliberately-to-degrade-women.html\" title=\"\">video game designers </a>who trade in images of women that many find degrading and even dehumanising? Because, for good or ill, the female body and its drapery remains territory where we do battle over our ideas of liberty as well as specific examples of personal choice. \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c782x\" title=\"\">This is a free country</a>,\" David Cameron asserted last week, promising in the next breath full backing to institutions that wish to forbid Muslim women from wearing the niqab, or full-face veil.</p><p>Excessive interference? Or an uncomfortable reminder that the UK's laudable ideal of tolerance and religious freedom has led, in some cases, to moral relativism – a blindness to injustices and injuries that undermine those very freedoms that we cherish, particularly for women. The idea of \"a national debate\" is often decried as a thin disguise, a veil if you like, to partially conceal intolerant ideas. But in these three very different cases – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/sep/20/how-many-wear-niqab-uk\" title=\"\">the still-rare niqab</a>, the daily diet of Page 3 \"lovelies\", and the monotonously omnipresent naked females in popular music – we should keep the conversation alive about our cultural discomforts.</p><p>We applaud Ms O'Connor, the No More Page Three campaigners and Mr Cameron for at least questioning the values of organised religion and commercial entertainment: but no blanket prohibitions, please. Rather, let us have an open discussion – initiated and led by the UK's female citizens, and not merely prompted by some Las Vegas shock merchant making shareable pop videos.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419202270|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|96634ff99d6d90def9316392129e3059c5c8ab6d -->",

        "headline":"Help to Buy: George's marvellous medicine",
        "body":"<p>This Tuesday George Osborne will make arguably his most significant economic intervention since the austerity budget of June 2010. Sadly, it has all the makings of being just as big an error. Like his cuts plan, Mr Osborne's extension of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">Help to Buy scheme</a> comes with an economic justification but is driven by political motivation. The political imperative was again made clear last week when David Cameron, rattled by Ed Miliband's energy-price cap, decided to bring forward the launch of the scheme from next year to this week. For the austerity Conservatives, this is about being seen to be on the voters' side. By no means is this a new theme, but it has taken on an added sharpness and urgency after the conferences.</p><p>It is in this light that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/10343793/Help-to-Buy-Key-questions-answered.html\" title=\"\">the coalition's new mortgage market booster</a> should be seen. Until this week, the government's Help to Buy scheme allowed first-time buyers to borrow up to 20% of the value of a new-build home from the government, interest-free for the first five years. The Treasury justified this policy as both helping would-be homeowners on to the housing ladder, and spurring on Barratt's and other giant construction firms to do more building. These explanations cannot apply to this latest extension of Help to Buy.</p><p>As of this week, any household – whether first-time or not – will be able to get help buying any kind of home, whether the paint is still drying or it has been around since George&nbsp;II, worth up to £600,000, as long as they can get together a deposit of 5% of the property value. The government will then provide a guarantee to the mortgage lender of a further 15% of the value. On Tuesday Mr Osborne will lay out further details – such as how much the guarantee will cost lenders (a cost which they&nbsp;will presumably recoup from the customers in higher borrowing rate). And after that, going by what housing market analysts are already saying about interest from would-be buyers, there may well be clouds of dust on British high streets as punters rush to their local estate agents.</p><p>Nearly a quarter-century on from the Lawson boom, stoked by another Conservative chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/oct/03/uk-economic-boom-could-be-boomlet\" title=\"\">Mr Osborne may well succeed in creating his own boomlet</a>. It may be patchy, it might be temporary, and it may well be dangerous. But the Tories surely hope that it will give them a fighting chance at the next general election, because electoral calculation runs through this policy like words on a stick of rock. Consider: the average price of a property across Britain is £172,000. Yet the government is underwriting purchases on homes worth up to £600,000.</p><p>It may be cynical to suggest that the cap has been set so high to entice wavering voters in key marginals in the pricier property markets of London and the south-east; then again, it may be blunt common sense. One group who will not benefit from Mr Osborne's £12bn intervention are those who cannot save up the 5% deposit. To help them, the government would need to either: improve regulations on landlords and lettings agents (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/letting-agents-cowboy-and-cowboy\" title=\"\">when ministers are doing the opposite</a>); provide more social or public housing (some hope); or allow property prices to come down from what remain their stratospheric highs. This policy doesn't help the first two objectives, and it positively blocks the last. Instead, it will push a few more Britons up the housing ladder and then yank that ladder away from the estimated 20% who'll have to fight it out in the underregulated private rented sector.</p><p>From the chancellor who inveighed against Labour's culture of debt and the government that vowed to focus on rebalancing the economy, Help to Buy smacks either of hypocrisy or an admission of defeat. If it works, this policy will get economic growth by luring households to borrow more and pump up Britain's historic housing bubble. What's more, it will subsidise banks to lend on property rather than productive enterprise. Encouraging debt rather than creating jobs, Help to Buy poses as a vote-winner. Perhaps, but it is also an economic dead end.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419201408|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|9d7f2bb6bdf724e6e1387861f6ea00a5a7f20ce0 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Eddie would go!\" This is the line surfers use to encourage one another to tackle big waves and show some bravado. Eddie Aikau was an Hawaiian lifeguard and fearless surfer who died on duty in 1978 aged 31, and whose achievements are celebrated in <a href=\"http://xgames.espn.go.com/surfing/article/9749881/legend-eddie-aikau-premieres-espn-films-30-30\" title=\"\">a new documentary</a>, Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau. In 10 years, he made more than 500 rescues in Waimea Bay. No lives were lost under his watch, though he often had to brave monstrous 9ft waves. A dedicated peacemaker, he also worked tirelessly to break up fights between the Australian and US surfing teams. In the 1980s, shortly after his death, the sport morphed into a heavily branded multimillion-dollar industry: all logos and big money. But stripped from those artifices, surfing remains much more than just an athletic endeavour: it's a practice that teaches you to be respectful of the environment, courageous in the face of danger, and compassionate towards others.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419201222|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|2a479ef17d346e4b3048c4fee6467318e88f7932 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"Stronger oversight\" is frequently demanded as a way of reassuring people about the spying activities and conduct of GCHQ. The problem is that trust has been lost in the current mechanisms: parliament's <a href=\"http://isc.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">intelligence and security committee (ISC)</a> lacks the necessary knowledge and experience and is woefully under-resourced; the interception and intelligence commissioners have a limited remit and are also reluctant to challenge the spooks; senior politicians who sign warrants are unlikely to have the necessary background to ask tough questions, particularly in relation to the effects of changing technologies.</p><p>Some tightening of UK and EU data protection laws may be desirable but, in the end, who wants to be going to the courts all the time?</p><p>The key bits of the two most important pieces of legislation in this area, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) and the Intelligence Services Act, will always require flexible interpretation. There is no perfect oversight solution – any new regime will still lack total transparency – and will involve individuals, almost certainly with high levels of security clearance, sitting in secret.</p><p>But it is important to ask: what do we want oversight to achieve? Similarly, it is necessary to test the current assessment of the threat and whether this justifies the levels of agencies current intrusion (and expenditure).</p><p>It is worth noting there have been fewer than 60 mainland deaths from domestic terrorism since 1989. In 2005, when 52 people died in the London bombings, another 3,201 died in traffic accidents. Is terrorism the persistent existential threat so often used to justify whole-population surveillance?</p><p></p><p></p><p>While it might be desirable for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption\" title=\"\">GCHQ to \"master the internet\"</a>, the range and extent of material now available for harvesting, plus the ease of large-scale data mining, changes the intrusion equation. Is \"you never know, all this data might be useful someday\" a good enough reason to initiate large schemes for mass collection? And do we really think that intrusion only occurs when globally collected data is actually searched?</p><p>There are circumstances when encryption must be broken but, after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden's revelations</a>, trust in e-commerce, e-banking and routine business confidentiality precautions, all reliant on crypto and all essential to the economy, is under threat. Who understands and tests GCHQ's judgments on the balance of risk in these matters?</p><p>There is probably not a perfect oversight regime to satisfy all the competing interests, but there is great scope for improvements. In my view, ministers should retain operational authorisation for agency activities – but warrants for interception, including the broad-based section 8(4) Ripa \"certificated\" warrants – should be passed for approval to a court, with short-term provision for retrospective warrant-granting in emergencies. The government should publish an annual fact-based national threat assessment rather than the current simplistic references to \"moderate\", \"substantial\" and \"severe\".</p><p>The ISC should become a proper select committee of the Commons and Lords with no pre-nomination by the prime minister and preferably with a robust chair person. It should have extended permanent staff, including a privacy advocate and academic technical experts not drawn from the intelligence community. And the ISC should hold at least one public session a year with the heads of the agencies and also with key ministers who should provide full, candid information in secret sessions.</p><p>In addition, all future annual ISC reports should cover the changing strategic objectives of agencies and address issues such as transparency, value for money, impact of technological change and commentary on intrusion limitation. The committee should have powers to demand access without the current limitation of potential ministerial veto, as well as the power of no-notice visits.</p><p>The intelligence service commissioners should be given more resources and be authorised to publish the types, purpose and quantity of the interception warrants that have been approved. Meanwhile, GCHQ should also follow the NSA and appoint a civil liberties and privacy officer to advise on all aspects of strategy. Snowden's documents provided details of what the agencies can and are seeking to do. Now that some of that detail is in the public domain GCHQ can, paradoxically, be more candid in discussing some of its activities and judgements. And, rather than concentrating on Snowden's \"traitorous\" nature, perhaps the debate should now turn on ways to achieve greater public support and legitimacy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419184619|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|641f69c144544dc039a95455e2d429d30bfd7708 -->",

        "headline":"Scientists do speak up, but politicians decide policy",
        "body":"<p>George Monbiot likens me to a dictator who has \"shut down programmes that produce unwelcome findings and sought to muzzle scientists\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/30/scientists-democracy-dissent-reasonable-boyd\" title=\"\">Muzzle scientists, bin data: this is the new Lysenkoism, 1 October</a>). He goes on to say that \"this is a modern version of Soviet Lysenkoism: crushing academic dissent on behalf of bad science and corporate power\". Nothing can be further from the truth.</p><p>Monbiot selectively quotes me: \"Scientists should be 'the voice of reason, rather than dissent, in the public arena'. Vladimir Putin? Kim Jong-un? No, Professor Ian Boyd,\" he says. The article to which he refers clearly explains that it is indeed the scientist's job to explain their field of work to the public and to ensure that any uncertainties are made clear. This most definitely involves scientists speaking up and the need for transparency in government. The point I was making, which Monbiot obviously didn't grasp, was that it is not their job to make politicians' decisions for them – when scientists start providing opinions about whether policies are right or wrong they risk becoming politicised. A politicised scientist cannot also be an independent scientist.</p><p>\"To be reasonable, when a government is manipulating and misrepresenting scientific findings, is to dissent,\" Monbiot says. But his adversarial politicisation of science is not the solution. Instead, the scientific community needs to understand its role in the complex field of policymaking to ensure that its contribution can be maximised. This means sticking to the scientific evidence and clearly explaining the risk associated with different policy options. It does not mean passing off personal opinion as scientific evidence.</p><p>Monbiot says the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs \"claimed that its field trials of neonicotinoid pesticides on bees showed that 'effects on bees do not occur under normal circumstances'. Hopelessly contaminated, the study was in fact worthless.\" He assumed the government (and implicitly I) had based its position on a single study. This is emphatically not true. It was based on a balanced assessment of all the available scientific evidence. The view arrived at was that the evidence behind the proposed ban of certain neonicotinoid pesticides was poor. Of course, lack of evidence does not amount to lack of impact. But we have little evidence that a ban will eliminate the problems Monbiot believes exist.</p><p>Last, Monbiot questions the link between badgers and bovine tuberculosis. He picks on only one part of a broad evidence base, suggesting figures we have been using have \"been sexed up from inadequate data\". Epidemiological modelling, based on data from <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.badger.org.uk%2F_Attachments%2FResources%2F322_S4.pdf&amp;ei=Y4dRUqr0L4OY0AXyp4GADw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtTi5TpepP4ZkD5-BC1PLBCBzAgQ&amp;bvm=bv.53537100,d.d2k&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">the Randomised Badger Culling Trial</a>, suggests badgers account for about 50% of bovine TB occurrences in the areas where it is prevalent. There is uncertainty around this number but particular genetic strains of the disease exist in badgers and cattle in the same geographic location. The trial also showed that reducing the density of badgers reduces TB in cattle. Badgers are a part of the disease cycle of bovine TB. However, it is possible to pursue quite different policy options. If scientists start to say one or other option is right or wrong, they begin to take the position of politicians and devalue the scientific evidence they claim to present.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419189765|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|17593477e04dc43b7673f71f650a58cb0dfb8484 -->",

        "headline":"The US government shutdown is a playground spat that badly damages credibility",
        "body":"<p>In September 2007 Gerrit Six <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-09-18-belgium-ebay_n.htm\" title=\"\">put Belgium on eBay</a>. It was day 100 of his country's attempt to form a government and an exasperated Six suggested selling it for parts. He offered free delivery but made it clear the country was secondhand and anyone who bought it would be saddled with $300bn in national debt. EBay eventually took the ad down, but not before the bidding reached €10m. A government wasn't formed for another three months. A few years later Belgium went 589 days without a government.</p><p>At the time the German paper, Die Tageszeitung, described Belgium, home to the headquarters of Nato and the EU with a per capita income of $38,100, as the \"most successful 'failed state' of all time\". Now the US is giving it a run for its money.</p><p>Not in terms of longevity – at the time of writing the American federal government has been closed for almost a week – but in terms of dysfunctionality. Belgium's stalemate was shaped by the challenges of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/14/belgian-elections-language-explosive-issue\" title=\"\">linguistic divide</a> that reflects an economic imbalance. In other words, it was about something.</p><p>The US government shutdown has been prompted by the party that recently lost an election trying to overturn a law it doesn't like. Having failed to stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-politics-congress\" title=\"\">healthcare reform</a> in the legislature, the supreme court and during the presidential election, House Republicans are now refusing to pass a budget until the reforms are delayed. This is their compromise position. They originally wanted it scrapped. It's less a shutdown than a shakedown.</p><p>Predictably, Obama is adamant that the Grand Old Party should not extort him out of his most prized legislation. Moreover, negotiating under these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent in which the nation can be held hostage to overturn laws that have been democratically settled.</p><p>Even most of those who oppose healthcare reform do not believe shutting down the government is a winning strategy.  <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/health.htm\" title=\"\">Polls show a huge majority of Americans disapprove of the shutdown</a> and far more blame the Republicans than the Democrats,  even though neither party comes out looking particularly accomplished. In practical terms the protest is largely futile. A key provision of the healthcare reforms kicked in the day before the shutdown and will continue whether the federal government is working or not. So Republican plan A is to close down the government until reforms are delayed, even though their demands have been rejected and the reforms are under way. There is no plan B, beyond belligerence.</p><p><a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\" title=\"\">\"We're not going to be disrespected,\"</a> insisted Republican Congressman Marlin Stutzman last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>If this continues for another few days, the damage will be limited. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/09/politics/government-shutdown-impact/\" title=\"\">So far, the shutdown barely affects most peoples' daily lives</a>. National parks and monuments are closed, some government websites are down and some regulatory bodies aren't working. But by 17 October Congress must agree to raise the debt ceiling so that the US can pay its bills. Republicans have used this as a bargaining chip before. If this standoff over the budget were to bleed into talks about the debt ceiling then the US <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/how-debt-ceiling-could-do-more-harm-than-the-impasse-in-congress.html\" title=\"\">risks defaulting, with ramifications for the global economy</a>. At that point you wouldn't be able to give the country away on eBay.</p><p>There are three main reasons the country has reached this position. First, the US is more polarised politically than in recent memory. There are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/17/partisan-polarization-in-congress-and-among-public-is-greater-than-ever/\" title=\"\">fewer self-described moderates</a> and far more conservatives and liberals among Republicans and Democrats respectively than there were in 2000 – the year the nation was evenly split between George Bush and Al Gore. The divide is not just ideological but geographical. In his book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Stossel-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">The Big Sort</a>, Bill Bishop explains that in 1976 roughly a quarter of Americans lived in counties where the presidential victor won by 20 points or more; by 2008, that figure was up to a half.</p><p>Second, if that weren't enough, the electoral constituencies have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/politics/gerrymandering/index.html\" title=\"\">so shamelessly gerrymandered</a> that consequences for acting in an extreme manner are rare. Electoral boundaries, in most areas, are drawn not by independent commissions but local politicians. Their aim is not to create congressional districts but safe seats for their party. Consequently, precious few congressmen or women fear losing an election so long as they keep their base happy. During the government shutdown of 1995-96 a third of all Republican members came from districts won by Democratic president Bill Clinton; today only 7% come from districts won by Obama. This means that for most of them to keep their jobs they must appeal not to the mainstream but to the margins.</p><p>Finally, as a result, the roots of this shutdown lie far more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/23/john-boehner-tea-party-stooge\" title=\"\">in an internal dispute within the Republican party</a> than they do in a battle between Democrats and Republicans. On one side are the dwindling number of moderate Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04graham-t.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimespolitics&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">those in the party establishment who see the Tea Party as an electoral liability</a> and fear the party has been overtaken by extremists who mistake acting out for strategy and opposing everything Obama does for opposition. On the other side are the Tea Party hardliners who believe the GOP establishment has compromised too often and given away too much. Branding negotiation a weakness in itself, they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\" title=\"\">not in Congress to make legislation but to make a noise</a>.</p><p></p><p>Since Republicans took over the House in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\" title=\"\">the latter have been running the show</a>, forcing the country from one self-imposed crisis to another with gay abandon, shameless guile and clueless zeal.</p><p>For while the economic fallout from this particular shutdown may be limited so far, the damage to America's credibility is huge and enduring. Belgium doesn't claim to be the leader of the free world, insist on its exceptionalism or have its currency (now the euro) as the world's reserve. The day before the shutdown, as the Italian government teetered towards apparent collapse <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/world/europe/intraparty-divisions-imperil-berlusconis-long-hold-on-power.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Italian politics has a turbulent, baroque flair even when little is at stake\". To the rest of the world American politics looks pretty similar. Only there's a great deal at stake.</p><p>It's not obvious how these trends can be effectively checked. It is, however, clear that until they are the American political class will look less like the  elders of the shining city on the hill they claim to be and rather more like kids in a kindergarten playground waiting for an adult to intervene.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191190|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|cf17973c5c43080395173abbb2cf8311072b75b6 -->",

        "body":"<p>To a casual observer of American politics the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/republicans-shutdown-enters-fourth-day-live\">ongoing government shutdown</a> and prospect of a cataclysmic debt default in the next two weeks may look like just another round of \"DC dysfunction\" between two parties hopelessly polarized and ideologically divided. It's not.<br /> <br />While the government shutdown is nominally about the Republican crusade against Obamacare, the issues at stake are far bigger than one law or even one president or one Congress. In reality, the psychodrama playing out in Washington is about the future of democracy in America. </p><p>And no, I'm not exaggerating. Unless the GOP's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/republicans-debt-limit-treasury-economy\">brand of extortion politics </a>is thwarted, America's democratic institutions will be so badly subverted that the nation will simply find itself in the position of staggering from one manufactured crisis to another with potentially both political parties threatening economic and political Armageddon if they don't get their way. That is, quite simply,<a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/Shutdown_Blues\"> no way to run a democracy</a> and it's why the only option facing President Obama and the Democratic party is to win this showdown and force the GOP to concede defeat.</p><p>It's important to understand at the outset that US democracy, for all of it many flaws, is one based on the idea of political compromise. In a system with so many obstacles to legislative outcomes – two houses of Congress, a separate executive branch and tons of minor obstruction points in each institution – there really is no other way to get things done.</p><p>That has dramatically changed in just the past few years.  It's not that compromise was always achievable in the past (the failure to break the Southern block on civil rights legislation is an obvious example), it's that the search for common ground has simply been thrown asunder, replaced instead by extortion politics.</p><p>For example, traditionally, raising the debt limit has been something of a pro forma exercise in Congress, done multiple times (sometimes begrudgingly) to ensure that the federal government can continue to issue debt and thus pay its obligations. But beginning in 2011, the Republican party came to see the debt limit as a tool for what they could not accomplish either at the ballot box or through the legislative process – namely an instrument for political blackmail.  </p><p>The result was a set of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/14/us-debt-ceiling-deadlock-questions-and-answers\">protracted negotiations</a> between Congress and the White House in the summer of 2011, all conducted with the prospect of debt default (which would occur if the debt limit was not raised) hanging over the head of official Washington.</p><p>The result was the Budget Control Act, a pernicious piece of legislation that trimmed the federal budget by billions of dollars and led to sequestration – a set of mandatory spending cuts that has hamstrung the economic recovery and caused untold and unnecessary distress for millions of Americans. Unsatisfied with just that policy outcome, Republicans are now upping the ante – and using not just the debt limit but also the budget to get their way. </p><p>Once upon a time, government shutdowns occurred because both parties could not agree on budgetary priorities. Ironically, that isn't even the issue today as both sides have agreed on the basic parameters of a continuing resolution to fund the US government. Rather this is about<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/02/obamacare-lifesaver-signup\"> Obamacare</a>, which Republicans have been unable to thwart though the legal, elective or legislative process (and satisfy their goal of denying healthcare coverage to millions of Americans). So now Republicans are holding the federal government as a hostage to get Democrats to agree to any possible concession that would weaken Obamacare.<br /> <br />First their goal was fully defunding the legislation; then it was delaying it a year; now it appears to be repealing certain parts of the bill, including the employer subsidies for their own congressional employees' health care coverage (because nothing says compassionate conservatism like screwing over your own employees to make a political point). </p><p>But the GOP brinkmanship over Obamacare is nothing compared to what they are asking for this year in return for raising the debt limit. Unlike 2011, when they were demanding a dramatic reduction in government spending, they are now insisting on the full implementation of their policy agenda. </p><p>No, I'm not exaggerating.</p><p>Here are the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/republican-ransom-demand-implement-romney-plan.html\">GOP's demands </a>for extending the nation's debt limit and preventing an economic catastrophe that would derail the fragile US recovery, likely spark a recession and fundamentally weaken America's economic competitiveness and in turn, national security:<br /> <br /><strong>One year debt limit increase</strong><br />-Not a dollar amount increase, but suspending the debt limit until the end of December 2014 (similar to what we did earlier this year). <br />-Want the year-long to align with the year delay of Obamacare.</p><p><strong>One year Obamacare delay</strong></p><p><strong>Tax reform instructions</strong><br />-Similar to a bill we passed last fall, laying out broad from Ryan Budget principles for what tax reform should look like. <br />-Gives fast track authority for tax reform legislation.</p><p><strong>Energy and regulatory reforms to promote economic growth</strong><br />-Includes pretty much every jobs bill we have passed this year and last Congress<br />-All of these policies have important positive economic effects.<br />-Energy provisions: Keystone Pipeline, Coal Ash regulations, Offshore drilling, Energy production on federal lands, EPA Carbon regulations<br />-Regulatory reform: REINS Act, Regulatory process reform, Consent decree reform, Blocking Net Neutrality</p><p><strong>Mandatory spending reforms</strong><br />-Mostly from the sequester replacement bills we passed last year<br />-Federal Employee retirement reform<br />-Ending the Dodd-Frank bailout fund<br />-Transitioning CFPB funding to Appropriations<br />-Child Tax Credit Reform to prevent fraud<br />-Repealing the Social Services Block grant</p><p><strong>Health spending reforms</strong><br />-Means testing Medicare<br />-Repealing a Medicaid provider tax gimmick<br />-Tort reform<br />-Altering disproportion share hospitals<br />-Repealing the Public Health trust Fund</p><p>As<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/09/republican-ransom-demand-implement-romney-plan.html\"> Jonathan Chait points out</a>, this is basically Mitt Romney's economic agenda. If that name doesn't ring a bell, Romney is the Republican presidential candidate who <em>lost</em> last year's presidential election by around 5 million votes. What Republicans are doing here is basically saying to the president (the guy who won by 5 million votes) \"implement our policy agenda or we will cause a catastrophic debt default\".</p><p>That isn't governing. It isn't democracy. It's a shakedown.</p><p>That Republicans would even risk the possibility of default to get their way should, in an ideal world (or at least one in which Americans paid more than passing attention to their government), invalidate their credentials as a political party. <br />Since that's unlikely to happen, the only appropriate course of action for President Obama and the Democrats to take is not simply to resist the Republican's ransom demands, but, in fact, to force them to cave in and pass a clean debt limit extension.</p><p>If they don't, Republicans will do it over and over and over again. Just as they are doing it again right now after they got a quarter loaf from the president in 2011. Moreover, what reason would there be for Republicans to ever moderate their politics? They wouldn't even need to win presidential elections. As long as they could hold on to their majority in the House (a majority lubricated by gerrymandered and polarized districts that encourage Republicans to take even more radical positions to appeal to their conservative supporters), they could simply hold the country hostage every couple of years to get their way. </p><p>This debate is not your garden-variety political crisis. It's the battle for the long-term viability of American democracy, and it's a battle that the Democrats simply must win even if it means risking default.</p><p>And no, I'm not exaggerating.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419117043|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|cae28c94e7b1beaec271a8233e5e95f431d7f11c -->",

        "headline":"Should women change their names after marriage? Consider the Greek way",
        "body":"<p>To change or not to change our last names when we marry. For many women in the UK, US, Australia and beyond, this is a complex dilemma that requires much angst, pondering, and discussion over drinks with girlfriends. I have even been asked by a boyfriend what my \"surname intentions\" were. Do we go the traditional route or keep our own personal and professional identity? Recently, Kate Winslet jumped into the foray with revelations about why she kept <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/10316266/Kate-Winslet-I-was-never-going-to-change-my-name-to-Rocknroll.html\">her name during her three marriages</a>, and Emma Watson stirred things up by tweeting that Hermione Granger <a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/5727-emma-watsons-rebuttal-to-hermione-granger-fan-on-twitter-makes-us-so-happy\">would almost certainly keep the Granger name</a>.</p><p>But here's a little advice you probably haven't heard before. If you're contemplating whether or not to change your name, talk to a Greek woman (or man).</p><p>When I called Maria Karamessini, director of the <a href=\"http://www.genderpanteion.gr/en/index.php\">Center for Gender Studies at Panteion University </a>in Athens, she was stunned when I told her how much debate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/sep/19/change-name-after-marriage-kate-winslet-rocknroll\">recent articles in the Guardian</a> and other publications had generated on this topic. </p><p>You see, Greece enacted a law in 1983 that <em>all</em> women must keep their birth surname. Period. </p><p>It was part of a major set of reforms Greece enacted in the late 1970s and early 1980s as the country emerged from a dictatorship and re-wrote its constitution and laws. Maria Karamessini was a college student at the time and took part in feminist movement campaigns for gender equality. As she tells it:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p> For women, it was an emancipation to keep our own names after marriage. Greece had the most progressive laws in Europe in 1983, and not only for the last names of women. Our feminist movement changed mentalities, but it was gradual. We went from a very traditional society with traditional gender roles.</p></blockquote><p>For the past 30 years, Greece has been a test case for what society would be like if women never changed their last names. It offers a very different model from how women in Britain and America have come to think about this debate. The conclusion most feminists come to is that the ideal is for women to have the ability to chose what they want and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/15/women-changing-name-after-marriage_n_927707.html\">men to go along with it</a>. But as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/16/changing-your-last-name_n_3287883.html\">studies have shown </a>(or just a casual look around your circle of friends), many women still adopt their husband's name, even when they have other options. In short, societal norms and pressure are hard to alter. </p><p>For Greek women, the 1983 law change coincided with a period of great strides for females. They got out of the home and began earning more college degrees and playing a bigger role in society. Of course, these advancements weren't just because women could keep their own surnames, but it set a dramatically different tone in a country known for tradition and godfather patriarch types.</p><p>Young Greeks in their 20s and 30s today accept it as the norm. They think about names and identities a lot differently than most other countries do. Boyfriends don't ask their girlfriends about their surname intentions. Violet Tsagkas grew up in Athens, came to the US for graduate school and now <a href=\"http://www.fem2pt0.com/meet-our-bloggers/\">writes for Fem2.0</a>. As she told me: \"It never occurred to me that [Greece] was unique until I started interacting more with foreigners, particularly after I moved to the US.\" </p><p>Overall, Greeks have had very few problems with the new system. Occasionally, it causes confusion. One Greek woman who helps administer a school told me that it can be challenging to call up students' parents, especially the mothers. She has taken to simply ringing them up and saying something to the effect of, \"Are you John's mom?\" No one finds that offensive.</p><p>The other issue that has arisen for some Greek women is traveling abroad, especially to the Middle East. Greek couples show up with different last names in their passports and some conservative societies don't believe they are actually married. It's not a widespread problem though, and it could be easily solved with a simple marriage certificate that Greek couples could carry abroad if needed. But the conservative government in 2008 used it as justification to change the law slightly so that spouses can decide if they want to add the other spouse's last name to their own. Women (and men) still have to keep their birth name, but they can have both last names now. Data are hard to come by on how many women have taken this option. </p><p>One of the big debates in feminist circles is whether it's really any better for women to keep their maiden names, which often are their father's last name. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/07/women-stop-changing-your-name-when-married\">Is that really liberating</a>? Here, too, Greece is progressive. When children are born, parents are get to decide if the child will have the mother's last name, the father's last name or both. </p><p>Yes, the name issue only goes so far to help women. Iran, for example, has had a similar system to Greece for about a century, yet Iranian women continue to struggle for many rights. <a href=\"http://www.nargesbajoghli.com/\">Narges Bajoghli</a>, a scholar on Iran, says that one benefit of Iran's system is that women still have a clear connection to their birth family, which has been valuable to women who find themselves in abusive relationships or other troubles and want to leave their marriages. The flip side, however, is that it has made young girls' \"honor\" an important part of family life.</p><p>This debate will continue in many countries, but Greece's example has altered my thinking. Perhaps we shouldn't just be talking about giving women options, but questioning why we are 30 years behind Greece.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419169107|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|90e4e324d0bb4eebdf1c9f93d4ac8682d0d7aa75 -->",

        "headline":"Benedict Cumberbatch: the next great British export?",
        "body":"<p>Is Benedict Cumberbatch a charming and handsome megastar-to-be? Or a pretentious and overbearing snot? Pardon the sharp contrast, but these are essentially the only categories we Americans have when welcoming new actors from across the pond.</p><p>The talented Cumberbatch made his US splash as the fearsome bad guy in Star Trek Into Darkness. He's garnering Oscar buzz for his upcoming portrayal of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate, and if you're more of a fanboy geek, you've already watched the new Hobbit trailer 700 times to hear Cumberbatch's voice as the dragon, Smaug. And did I mention that his TV series Sherlock is available on Netflix? Wanting for interesting roles, he is not.</p><p>But does all this translate to bonafide stardom in the states? I wouldn't be so sure. Americans like British men in certain leading roles: namely James Bond and wizards. Pierce Brosnan was beloved as 007, but not much else. The Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings films have earned Orlando Bloom some nice paychecks, but you don't see him on the big screen without a pirate ship or elf ears. Colin Firth won an Oscar for his role in The King's Speech, and then predictably evaporated from the collective consciousness of America. </p><p>Here's the problem, Britain: these men all possess debonair charm, refined good looks, and the ability to deliver intelligent, nuanced performances. This is a laundry list of the very things Americans find insufferable. We're a simple, insecure populace. We don't like people who are better than us. We like hunky morons like Mark Wahlberg. The closest thing to a hunky moron Britain's ever sent us is Robert Pattinson, and I'm pretty sure he's faking it.</p><p>And while it's been over 200 years since we lived under colonial rule, there's something about that quintessential English affect that we still find abrasively superior. Even amongst our own. Observe the widespread animosity towards actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Anne Hathaway. Talented and beautiful, sure, but also perceived as uptight, erudite, perhaps even royal in their dispositions. They just seem British, right down to their names. That doesn't bode well for Mr Cumberbatch, presumably named after a Hogwarts math teacher.</p><p>Now the Australians? We've been making megastars out of them for years. Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, the Hemsworth brothers ... they're everything Americans idealize about manhood. Rugged, short-tempered frontiersman, ready to conquer the plains with a John Wayne-esque machismo. And – take note, Cumberbatch – not too proud to completely sterilize their native accents.</p><p>Americans don't have passports, we don't meet many foreigners, and we think proper English diction is an indicator of condescension or homosexuality. Sadly, you can see it in our politics as well: we just tend to trust cowboys more than intellectuals. Hell, we gave Paul Hogan his own Crocodile Dundee trilogy. For the past two decades, Aussie actors have ruled our megaplexes and made billions of dollars by embodying the classical attributes of American masculinity.</p><p>When Brits have succeeded here in the states, it's when they have done the same. Batman star Christian Bale exemplifies the guy who we'll trust in a dramatic role because we also know he can beat our brains in ... without being a snob about it. Sean Connery may have been a cultured spy in the Bond films, but he also could slum it as a lunchpail tough guy in films like The Untouchables. Fellow Scotsman Daniel Craig, the most blue-collar of all the Bonds, seems to be on the same track. Even the immortal Daniel Day-Lewis needed bare-knuckle roles in Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood before Americans would ever have accepted him as Lincoln.</p><p>If you want success beyond the stereotypical British roles, you must have the charisma to kick ass without the martini drinking pretense or Oscar Wilde snark. The only other route to British success at the American box office is with humor, a la Hugh Grant or Russell Brand, and even in these cases, success was short lived. Again, it's because we don't relate to these guys. We're laughing at them, not with them. That Adam Sandler has dominated the American comedy market for 20 years tells you all you need to know about our appreciation for nuanced performance versus brute stupidity.</p><p>Does Benedict Cumberbatch have what it takes to become a megastar in the US? Well, he's smart, attractive, and incredibly talented, so history says no. Just ask Jude Law. Then again, as I look around and see a generation of waifish, anti-meathead hipsters slowly taking over the cultural landscape, with their curly mustaches and effeminate skinny jeans, I can't help but wonder if perhaps America is ready to ditch the macho stereotypes and create a true British megastar for the modern era. Sadly, portraying Julian Assange, whom America's media has vilified as no less than a foreign terrorist, may not be a step in the right direction.</p><p>On the other hand, Assange is Australian. So maybe there's a chance.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419012702|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|c35964e9bd7593f3431d22ef7e7b3dbbb07e3b8b -->",

        "body":"<p>Meghan McCain has been on a mission to change the GOP, and her series on the Pivot network, <a href=\"http://www.pivot.tv/shows/raising-mccain\">Raising McCain</a>, is her latest effort. The show's curiosity, quick-pace, and uncensored language is fresh for television but won't be changing voter's minds anytime soon. If McCain is going to shift the Republican party to her liking, the best thing she could do is run for office herself.</p><p>As a regular columnist for the Daily Beast, Meghan McCain easily separated her politics from her father, John McCain. In a November 2012 <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/16/meghan-mccain-on-why-the-republican-party-needs-to-wake-up.html\">article</a>, Meghan pleads once more with the Republican Party to shift to a more socially liberal, fiscally conservative platform. She writes: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We can't keep worrying about ultraconservative white male voters. At the end of the day, I still believe I'm on the right side of history, and we can't let this party sink away. We can and we must evolve. </p></blockquote><p>She concludes by threatening that if she doesn't see change soon she might register as an independent in 2016. For someone who has been purported to be the \"<a href=\"http://www.policymic.com/articles/63711/meghan-mccain-is-this-the-new-face-of-the-republican-party\">New Face of the Republican Party</a>\", considering such a switch – <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0608/Meghan_McCain_gives_Dad_a_special_Fathers_Day_gift.html\">again</a>, after her backing of Kerry in '04 – is pretty heavy intimidation. Yet, she knows both that the party needs her and needs to be more like her. She has <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2013/09/24/exp-pmt-meghan-mccain-pivot-raising-mccain.cnn\">spoken often</a> about how the GOP needs to reach out to minorities, women, and conservative millenials. Her show is her latest attempt to do that, and bring the party around with her. </p><p>Raising McCain has received some less than stunning <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/09/meghan-mccain-takes-feminism-edgy-new-show/69207/\">reviews</a> in its first month of airing. Willa Paskin of Slate <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2013/09/megan_mccain_s_tv_show_raising_mccain_reviewed.html\">takes issue</a> with the broad vagueness of the show and its haphazard format. The New Yorker's Emily Nussbaum comes down hard on the content of the show in a <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2013/09/16/130916crte_television_nussbaum?currentPage=2\">broader review</a> of the full line up for Pivot. But in the context of McCain's career in media, the show appears as a striking effort of a politically active and discontent young Republican to start fresh. </p><p>Her political affiliations are firmly connected to her name and she draws much of her voice in her writing and commentary from it. But the show does not have the same politicized script of her other forays in public debate – highlighting her as the socially liberal Republican desperately fighting for her party. McCain and her editorial team instead chose a different route, exploring timely issues alongside their audience and leaving the politics to be the punchline of a few jokes. </p><p>While she very well could have hosted a show dedicated to exploring what being an \"evolved Republican\" means, the subtlety and beauty of forgoing that option is that the audience is entertained by the \"cast's\" shenanigans, while being reminded from time to time that she is indeed a Republican.</p><p>For a millenial Republican, it's probably refreshing to see someone you can relate to. For a millenial Democrat – like myself – it's intriguing to see what a socially liberal Republican's beliefs can really look like. And for anyone politically minded, the series is a chance to witness the shift in Republicanism that McCain herself has long predicted and demanded. </p><p>That visibility should not be dismissed as trivial. The show, however plagued by poor format, is an important addition to the growing chorus of Republican voices asking for a different party. But a television show on a fledgling network can only go so far.</p><p>McCain has said <a href=\"http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/meghan-mccain-sexter-truth-teller-and-now-talk-show-host/?_r=1\">over</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/meghan-mccain-talks-new-show-i-get-heat-for-every-single-thing-i-do/\">over</a> again that she is not interested in running for office. Ever. She cites her lack of tact, indiscriminate past, and her distaste for \"dynastic culture\" in politics. She, however, is in the special position of having the network, ability, and – though dynastic political culture is unfortunate – name credibility needed to successfully run for office. Given her unorthodox beliefs, it is all the more necessary for her to have those resources in order to run in a Republican primary.</p><p>Personally, I'm a great admirer of feminist Audre Lorde. In one of her speeches, she elaborated on her often cited phrase, \"<a href=\"http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/margins-to-centre/2006-March/000794.html\">the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house</a>.\" Lorde was speaking about racism and feminism, noting that one cannot work within oppressive and intransigent systems in order to subvert them. In this instance I'd argue against that. </p><p>It might be true that it is nearly impossible to dismantle a whole system by working exclusively from within, but if McCain's goal is to radically shift the Republican Party's platform, she could be affecting a heck of a lot more change as an elected official than as a television show host. Raising McCain is a step in the right direction, but I hope McCain decides the next logical step in changing Republicanism is to put her name on a ballot.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418677745|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|2ec6610b4ff66e6473298549925350203e3eac1e -->",

        "headline":"About 15% of Americans live in poverty, so why is no one talking about it?",
        "body":"<p>It's not my intention to belittle the government shutdown or the political showdown underway between President Obama and the GOP, but more often that not, America's fickle news media is dominated by one subject. It's what gets left out that is often more telling than what everyone (or at least the news) is talking about.</p><p>Remember the food stamp fight? It was only two weeks ago that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill that would strip $40bn from Snap (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, aka the food stamp program) over the next 10 years by imposing work requirements and eliminating waivers for \"some able bodied adults\". The move, which would effectively cut support for millions of poor Americans, was seen by critics as a heartless attempt by House Republicans to hack away at the nation's dwindling social safety net. But, what is more outrageous is that it took a draconian piece of legislation to even get the nation's attention on what has become one of the country's most ignored issues: poverty.</p><p>The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism<a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/a-new-focus-on-poverty-raises-a-question-about-times-coverage/\"> found that </a>out of 52 mainstream media outlets analysed, coverage of poverty amounted to less than 1% of available news space from 2007 to 2012. It's even more astonishing considering that period covered a historic recession. </p><p>One of the report's conclusions was that media organizations chose not to cover poverty because it was potentially uncomfortable to advertisers seeking to reach a wealthy consumer audience. As Barbara Ehrenreich, who contributes articles on social issues for Time Magazine, <a href=\"http://economichardship.org/why-are-working-people-invisible-in-the-mainstream-media/\">put it</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>They don't want really depressing articles about misery and hardship near their ads.</p></blockquote><p>Poverty coverage is seen as non-lucrative, time-consuming and involves high levels of commitment that editors are unwilling to give their reporters in this age of newsroom budget tightening. The greatest irony, however, is that poverty, as Tampa Bay Times media critic, Eric Deggans, <a href=\"http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102832/It-Cant-Happen-Here.aspx\">told The Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard</a> earlier this year \"is in some ways the ultimate accountability story – because, often, poverty happens by design\".</p><p>In a nation where, according to the US Census Bureau's <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/17/us-usa-economy-poverty-idUSBRE98G0PN20130917\">poverty statistics </a>released last month, 46.5 million people (roughly 15%) of the nation's population lives in poverty, the idea that the media would not cover such a pressing human interest story because of financial troubles is misguided, if not inexcusable. It represents a failure on the part of the industry in fulfilling its role in serving the public interest.</p><p>The absence of coverage has left the poor with no voice in American society. As the plight of the nation's shrinking middle class, a central issue in last year's presidential campaign, consistently leads media coverage, the idea of poverty in America almost seems a relic from the past. </p><p>Nearly 50 years after President Lyndon B Johnson launched the \"war on poverty\" program that ushered in social security, Medicare and Medicaid amongst others, you could be fooled into believing that poverty is no longer a public policy problem in the US. Or as former Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, put it in a <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/05/01/politicians-press-must-confront-poverty-in-america\">US News &amp; World Report op-ed</a> in May: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It feels today like a 'war on poverty' would need to begin with a battle just to gain recognition that poverty even exists.</p></blockquote><p>New media outlets, from <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/09/02/1234857/-Inspiring-images-as-fast-food-workers-take-their-fight-to-the-streets#\">blogs like Daily Kos</a> to social media, appear ready to fill the coverage vacuum. There are<a href=\"http://allisonkilkenny.com/\"> independent journalists</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/povertynews\">Twitter activists</a> who prolifically cover issues that affect the working poor from<a href=\"http://www.demos.org/50-years-other-america\"> debates</a> on raising the federal minimum wage to securing labour rights. The American Prospect, a left-leaning socially conscious bi-monthly magazine, particularly <a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/pressing-upward-way/\">does great work</a> on highlighting poverty.</p><p>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/29/us-fast-food-workers-strike-low-wages\"> fast-food worker marches </a>this past summer were a watershed moment for poverty coverage in many ways. Mainstream media coverage of the protests was scant (the Guardian a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/06/burger-king-fast-food-worker-strike\">notable exception</a>), but reporting and analysis were available elsewhere online, most notably from Democracy Now!, the independent TV network that ran a feature online titled \"<a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2013/9/12/the_american_way_of_poverty_as\">Forgotten Poor</a>\", offering viewers a glimpse of those struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>If this growing underclass of poor Americans continues to be ignored, it will be permanently damaging to what remains of the independent character of US journalism. By bowing to their corporate sponsors in forsaking poverty coverage, the mainstream media is doing a huge disservice to us all by denying us a national discussion on poverty that has not taken place in decades.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419009214|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|f8c528edd07c05812b28af3e15ae074df5bbf1a5 -->",
