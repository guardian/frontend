        "headline":"The Koch brothers' beer offensive against Obamacare loses its fizz",
        "body":"<p>What's a family values conservative to do when every effort to protect millions of Americans from the scourge of affordable healthcare fails? </p><p>Break out the beer, of course. The latest campaign to kill off Obamacare in its infancy is now playing out on college campuses where a conservative group known as Generation Opportunity (GO), who are funded in part by the billionaire Koch brothers, is using the <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/10/14/3689755/young-are-being-recruited-to-help.html\">lure of free beer</a> and \"opt out\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_koozie\">beer koozies</a> to persuade young students not to buy health insurance – or, at least, not to buy it from the Obamacare exchanges.</p><p>Traditionally, one might expect God-fearing conservatives to be warning youth about the dangers of alcohol consumption, rather than plying them with free liquor, but these are desperate times. The determined Koch brothers have already spent <a href=\"http://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/09/12247/breaking-new-list-dark-money-shell-game-groups-connected-kochs\">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> trying to derail the president's healthcare law. So far, though, despite their best efforts, Obamacare has proved as <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-01/will-the-young-invincibles-join-obamacare-.html\">\"invincible\" as the young people</a> it needs to enroll. While it's unlikely that the beer exchanges, shall we call them, will be the game-changer, the Kochs may well end up driving many of us to drink with their relentless and futile vendetta to undo the law – not just the college students.</p><p>Nearly every movement to \"educate the public\" about the \"dangers\" of Obamacare can be linked in some way to the Koch brothers, and this latest college campus effort is no different. Last month, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/koch-brothers-heritage-action-donation-98054.html\">Politico revealed</a> that GO has received $5.04m from the Koch-funded entity known as Freedom Works. This \"grassroots\" movement is now about to embark on an \"<a href=\"http://optout.org/\">Opt Out</a>\" tour of 20 college towns across the country as part of its effort to steer young people away from the Obamacare exchanges. As GO's 29-year-old president, Evan Feinberg, put it:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>What we're trying to communicate is, 'No, you're not actually required to buy health insurance' … you might have to pay a fine, but that's going to be cheaper for you, and better for you.</p></blockquote><p>After coming under criticism for this statement, Feinberg (who previously worked at the Charles Koch Institute) has since clarified that GO is not trying to persuade young people to opt out of buying insurance altogether, just from buying it through the healthcare exchanges.</p><p>Maybe, I'm naive to think that most young Americans will not fall for this cynical ploy, no matter how much free beer they are plied with. It seems to me that any campaign that is based on a false premise – in this case, that young people could get cheaper insurance before Obamacare or since – seems destined for failure. </p><p>According to a report released in September by the Department of the Health and Human Services, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/09/20130917b.html\">56% of the people</a> who are applying for health insurance today will be able to get coverage through the health insurance marketplace for <em>less than $100 a month</em>. This means that a large percentage of the youth market that GO are targeting would be able to get comprehensive health coverage under Obamacare for a very low rate.</p><p>If Feinberg or any other GO employee genuinely knows about better insurance deals than that for students, it would be really helpful if they listed them on their Opt Out website. Surely, that would be a far better use of their Koch dollars than buying more crates of beer?</p><p>As it is, the Opt Out website contains no information beyond vague and unsubstantiated claims about Obamacare being a \"bad deal\", and two embarrassingly poorly made ads featuring a \"Creepy Uncle Sam\" character who pops up between a woman's legs as she undergoes a gynaecological exam and asks a young man to roll over while he pulls on a surgical glove. The message – that government should stay out of healthcare – is about as subtle as Miley Cyrus' recent sledgehammer licking antics.</p><p>Whether Creepy Uncle Sam and his creepier backers will succeed in bringing down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) remains to be seen, but the prognosis is not good. Since the ACA was signed into law in 2010, it has miraculously managed to withstand \"Hitler death panel\" comparisons, state by state efforts to block its implementation, a US supreme court challenge to its constitutionality and, most recently, a defunding effort that led to the federal government shutdown. </p><p>As the New York Times recently reported, the Koch brothers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html?_r=0\">have been heavily involved</a> in all of these separate efforts through their generous funding of groups like Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action and, of course, Generation Opportunity. But so far, their efforts have been in vain. Not only is Obamacare still the law of the land, but the law has actually <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/gop-plummets-obamacare-soars-shutdown\">gained a major bump</a> in support since the shutdown stand-off.</p><p>As it happens, even the Koch brothers have begun to realize that their attempts to stop the ACA are getting them nowhere. Last week, a representative of Koch Industries sent a <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/10/koch-industries-doesnt-want-be-tainted-obamacare-prompted-shutdown/70350/\">letter</a> to members of the Senate distancing the company from efforts to defund Obamacare, while still making it clear that Koch really does not like the law. </p><p>Does this mean the Koch brothers are done with their various and multifaceted efforts to bring it down? Probably not, but if they at least scale back their efforts to just distributing free beers, that might not be such a bad thing.</p><p>After what they have put us all through, we deserve one.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420191676|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|8fcc206ac37c88c25259e436f92d55dc090af129 -->",

        "body":"<p>I don't believe the Democrats <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/11/democrats-win-house-2014-midterms\">will win back the House of Representatives</a> in 2014. President Obama's low approval rating, combined with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_midterm_election\">usual midterm loss</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cla.temple.edu/ipa/wp-content/blogs.dir/8/files/2012/12/Bafumi-Erikson-Wlezien-Midterm-Elections.pdf\">normal movement away (pdf)</a> from the White House party on the national House ballot, should keep Republicans in control. Yet, there's a difference between thinking whether the Democrats \"will\" win back the House or whether they \"can\" win it back.</p><p>Right now, the Democrats hold a lead of about 4-5pt per the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2014-national-house-race\">HuffPollster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html\">Real Clear Politics</a> average. Many have concluded that this lead would not be enough to take back the House, if the election were held today. However, I believe that it quite likely <em>would be enough</em>. </p><p>How so? Let's address a bunch of reasons people expect that a 4-5pt Democratic lead on the national House ballot would result in Republicans still holding the House – and then show why I think those could be wrong. </p><p><strong>1. A uniform shift of 4-5pt on all House seats would still leave Republicans winning a majority of seats</strong></p><p>North Carolina Republican Congressman Robert Pittenger was the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2013/01/02/1382471/thanks-to-gerrymandering-democrats-would-need-to-win-the-popular-vote-by-over-7-percent-to-take-back-the-house/\">\"median\" representative in 2012</a>. Half the races were decided by more than his 6.1pt margin and half were decided by less. Given that Democrats won the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012\">national House vote</a> by 1.4pt, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_national_swing\">uniform swing</a> across all districts would imply that Democrats would need to win the national House vote by 7.5pt to take back the House. </p><p>Count me as one of the people who does not believe in uniform swings. It's not that the uniform swing is uninformative; it's that it is very inexact. There are <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/g-o-p-has-2-in-3-chance-of-taking-house-model-forecasts/\">many factors</a> that go into House races, including challenger quality, money spent, and whether or not the incumbent is running for re-election. Most of those are unknown at this point for key races. </p><p>You only need to look at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2006\">2006 election</a> to get an idea. Back <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2004\">in 2004</a>, Republicans won the national House vote by 2.6pt. They won the median district by a little over 10pt. In other words, there was that same 7.5pt pro-Republican bias between the national House vote and the median district in 2004 as there was last year.</p><p>When we examine 2006, we see the bias simply didn't hold. Democrats only won the national House vote by 8pt, which should have given them the thinnest of majorities per a uniform swing. Instead, they took 233, or 13 more, seats than a uniform swing implied. </p><p>The 218th seat won by the Democrats belonged to Leonard Boswell, who had actually taken the seat easily in 2004. He had health problems, which led to a closer than expected re-election campaign. Boswell, with a winning margin of 5.4pt, might have survived even if the national Democratic margin had been closer to 3pt. </p><p>My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/20/democrats-have-a-chance-2014\">own math</a>, taking into account redistricting in 2011, says a 3pt Democratic win in the national vote and a takeover of the House would not be nearly as likely as in 2006; but a 4 or 5pt victory would probably do the trick.</p><p><strong>2. The experts say there are very few seats up for grabs</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/house/charts/race-ratings\">indispensable Cook Political Report</a> has only has 13 Democratic-held seats listed in the relatively competitive tossup or \"lean\" category. Of course, Democrats need to take 17 seats to win the House. The ratings reflect, among other things, a lack of strong challengers for the Democrats and lack of retirements by Republicans.</p><p>The thing is that expert ratings (like most polling) are not all that predictive a year out from an election. At this point in the 2006 cycle, there were 17 Republican seats in the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20060627180349/http://www.cookpolitical.com/races/report_pdfs/2006_house_comp_oct8.pdf\">lean or tossup categories (pdf)</a>. That's well short of the 30 seats that Democrats would ultimately take from Republicans. At this point in the 2010 cycle, there were 28 Democratic seats in the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101029020519/http://cookpolitical.com/charts/house/competitive_2009-10-08_12-03-36.php\">lean or tossup category</a>. Republicans, of course, went onto gain <em>63 seats</em> in 2010.</p><p>It's not until later in the cycle when individual seat rankings become quite useful. That's when potential challengers and incumbents read the national environment and decide to run or not. Chances are that if the 4-5pt Democratic lead holds, the individual seat rankings will reflect that edge. For now, individual seat ratings probably aren't all that helpful to understanding which way and how hard the wind is blowing.</p><p><strong>3. The Abramowitz model says Democrats need something like a 13pt margin on the national House ballot</strong></p><p>Alan Abramowitz's <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/midterm-forecast-democrats-may-gain-house-seats-in-2014-but-majority-probably-out-of-reach/\">national House ballot to seats model</a> seems to have <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/07/news/la-pn-small-democratic-gain-midterm-election-20130207\">unusual sway</a> among some. The model is elegant in the sense that it does a good job of trying to map the midterm penalty and how much exposure the majority party has, in a minimalistic fashion. The problem is that some don't seem to quite understand how the model should work.</p><p>It's not a straight national vote-to-seat equation. It's built for early September of a midterm year. Abramowitz isn't saying that a 13pt Democratic margin in the national House ballot on election day is what Democrats need to take over the House. What he is saying is that a 13pt lead in September is likely to shrink because of the natural movement away from the White House party on the national House ballot during the course of the election year. </p><p>Moreover, the model is inexact. It would be within the margin of error of the model for Democrats to take back the House with a 2pt September lead on the national House ballot. In 2010, the model forecasted a Republican gain of 45 seats per my calculation. That was 18 seats off the final Republican gain of 63 seats. </p><p>Abramowitz's forecast is a good starting-point for understanding how uphill is the Democrats' task in taking back the House, but it is far from perfect.</p><p><strong>4. The final national House ballot surveys are biased against Republicans</strong></p><p>Charlie Cook has a <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/off-to-the-races/midterm-elections-could-be-a-wave-but-who-s-going-to-drown-20130729\">rule that you subtract 2pt</a> from the Democratic margin on the final national House ballot to know how the national House vote is actually going to pan out. That may have worked over five years ago, though it doesn't seem to work anymore. In <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2008_generic_congressional_vote-2173.html\">2008</a>, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2010_generic_congressional_vote-2171.html\">2010</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2012_generic_congressional_vote-3525.html\">2012</a>, the Real Clear Politics average of the national House ballot underestimated the actual Democratic standing in the national House vote. So, there's no reason to think the final national House ballot will overstate the Democrats' standing in 2014.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There are plenty of reasons the Democrats won't win back the House. But it's not impossible that they will. If the same national environment that is producing a 4-5pt on the national House ballot still exists in a year's time, Democrats may very well win back the House.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420078259|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|40724544b43ebf6ec007ba66e22ea88dc8147824 -->",

        "body":"<p>I don't think there is anything wrong with making a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2013/oct/14/miley-cyrus-tongue-madonna-pop-star\" title=\"\">role model out of Miley Cyrus</a>, as long as she is not your only role model. But the trouble is there aren't many relatable role models for young girls who have as much substance as they do sex appeal. Cyrus, Rihanna and Taylor Swift are all hugely talented women beloved by teenagers, but they don't talk about much beyond love, sex and the pleasure and pain brought about by both.</p><p>It's hard to find a woman as inspiring as my teen icon, Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill. A documentary about Hanna, <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a>, is being shown at the <a href=\"https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=punk-singer\" title=\"\">London Film Festival</a> this week, and I would urge young women in the city to go and see it. Hanna showed me that life gets exciting when you start thinking beyond sex, your body and how others see you.</p><p>When puberty hit, I didn't know what to do with myself. At the time, I loved Mariah Carey, but Mariah was so remote and glossy that I thought the Queen was probably a more realistic role model for me. As well as changing physically, I was filled with restlessness. I was ready to abandon the cornerstones of my childhood – Disney films, Little Women and the chunky knitted waistcoats beloved of the parents of small girls in the mid to late 90s. But I had no idea what to replace them with. What came next? I longed for something thrilling to happen, someone to recruit me to their cult and turn my world on its head, and I haunted my tiny town like a grumpy ghost, searching for it among the magazines at the newsagents, and the heavy plum nail polish at the chemist.</p><p>It turned out that it was in the library all along.</p><p>When I saw the <a href=\"http://ellenvonunwerth.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Ellen von Unwerth</a> photograph on the cover of <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/hole-live-through-this-20120525\" title=\"\">Hole's Live Through This</a> album, my relief was visceral. The photograph of a gorgeous, ruined, weeping beauty queen contained the message that being hot doesn't necessarily make you happy. Holding my breath at the checkout desk, I waited for the librarian to deny me access to such subversive material. Luckily, she just wanted 50p.</p><p>Back at home, listening covertly through headphones, I discovered the album's contents were even more potent than the cover. I heard the words of a woman who was blatant about her need to be desired, but furious with those who desired her. Someone who could articulate the urge to objectify yourself before anyone else got there first.</p><p>When it was time for Courtney Love and co to go back to the library, I was ready for their CD rack neighbours, Bikini Kill and their scarily titled Pussy Whipped album. (Looking back, it was quite a progressive library.) Among the insistent stomping beats and sludgy guitar riffs, I found my pubescent Desiderata. Kathleen Hanna represented sex and politics without borders. She made feminism, which I had previously associated with misery and dreariness, sound fabulous and alluring. Hanna made me feel as if I was entitled to join her world and that nothing could stop me from speaking my mind.</p><p>Without Bikini Kill, I might have bought the Spice Girls' confusing messages about girl power and Thatcherism wholesale. And without further context, the messages today's young girls are getting about self-worth, sex and desirability are pretty baffling. The young women I know are smart enough to realise they need something a bit more solid, but they can't find it on TV or on the radio, so they are looking back to bands like Bikini Kill and Hole to provide it.</p><p>We need to search for and celebrate contemporary musicians who invoke the spirit of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/30/riot-grrrl-collection-zine-olivia-laing\" title=\"\">riot grrrl</a> movement, otherwise the girls who need them most will never find them. And it's becoming increasingly unlikely that they'll bump into them at the library.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420246998|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|e0605f2d7350e3fa84a96fb4bfc19c406986a3eb -->",

        "headline":"And so America's skewed democracy lurches on toward its next crisis",
        "body":"<p>Just as the House of Representatives was finally voting to reopen the government and save the nation from reneging on debt and inviting a downgrade, a House stenographer <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics-live/liveblog/live-updates-the-shutdown-9/?id=c7c5125a-dbc6-48e0-80e9-3302f05ac32b\">appears to have suffered a breakdown</a>. Grabbing the microphone, she started defending God's honour before the nation.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He will not be mocked. The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. The constitution would not have been written by freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters.</p></blockquote><p>After being removed and questioned, she was taken away for psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Her mental health is no laughing matter. But the <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/16/this-is-not-one-nation-under-god-house-stenographer-taken-from-the-floor-after-bizarre-outburst/\">description of her interjection by much of the media as a \"bizarre\" interruption to the House vote</a> deserves interrogation.</p><p>Because everything about this was bizarre. From the moment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\">Ted Cruz got up and started quoting Ashton Kutcher and talking about Star Wars</a> into the wee hours, this entire process has been nothing but bizarre. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\">America, once again, took the familiar road</a> from the height of dysfunction to the brink of default – until reality grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and slapped it straight, before it did itself and others grave harm.</p><p>Because America is powerful, the world has to take notice of these self-inflicted crises. But because it has become so predictably dysfunctional and routinely reckless, they are difficult to take seriously or, at times, even fathom. To the rest of the world and much of America, this is yet another dangerous folly. The fact that the nation did not default should come as cold comfort. The fact that we are even talking about it defaulting is a problem.</p><p>This particular flirtation with fate was driven by a visceral opposition to the moderate provision of something most western nations take for granted: healthcare. The reforms they opposed had been been passed by the very body of which they are a member and had been been approved by the US supreme court, the guardian of the very constitution they claimed to be defending. For this, they started a fight they never had the numbers to win and carried on waging it long after it was clear they had lost.</p><p>\"We're not going to be disrespected,\" <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\">insisted Republican Indiana Congressman Marlin Stutzman</a>, last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>Nor did anyone else. That's why the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/congress-budget-debate.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Republicans went down to humiliating defeat</a>. As South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham admitted:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We took some bread crumbs and left an entire meal on the table. This has been a really bad two weeks for the Republican party.</p></blockquote><p>But to couch this episode only as a Democratic victory would really miss the point. For the process by which such a shutdown and breakdown could happen is not just the work of a few cranky Tea Party types. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/shutdown-us-government-republican-party\">rooted in an electoral system that is heavily gerrymandered</a>, where only those who can pay, can play. The reason the Republican dissenters could proceed with such unstrategic zeal is because they are in safe, rigged seats and so risk no challenge at the polls.</p><p>Indeed, given that they only have to fear nomination within their own party, rather than election by the nation at large, there is an incentive to act out in this way because it appeals to the base. When constituencies are so heavily contorted in the interests of incumbents that there is precious little consequence to anything a politician does, then <a href=\" http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/\">you don't really have a democracy</a>, you just have the vote.</p><p>This temporary resolution buys them time, but it does not by them any real solution – since there is absolutely nothing to prevent a repeat performance. Which is what it is: a performance. As said Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid put it on Wednesday night:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm tired. Concluding this crisis is historic. But let's be honest: this was pain inflicted on the nation for no good reason. We cannot … we cannot, cannot make the same mistakes again.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, they can. Almost certainly, they will.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420250081|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|070e346c4c45736cf3528fdce34ada4160dc7e2d -->",

        "headline":"The fight against obesity starts in the head, not in the stomach",
        "body":"<p>Having your pot belly jiggled at any age isn't nice. The doctor (I remember your name, lady – I've not forgotten) who decided mine needed wobbling when I was 16 was rather misguided. No – actually she was tremendously insensitive. Her pinching of my belly fat combined with the question \"when are you going to get rid of this?\" sent me straight home to a packet of salt and vinegar Hula Hoops. After a horrible medical appointment, I indulged in a beautiful, fatty, carb jewellery fest that adorned every finger. I swallowed it fast in an act of fat teenage rebellion.</p><p>The talking-tough approach never worked with me. Over the years various medical professionals tried different techniques to tackle my obesity. There was the slip-it-in-at-the-end-of-the-appointment ploy: \"Have you considered losing a bit of weight?\" Nah, bye! There was the blaming-an-unrelated-medical-condition-on-your-weight tactic, in which you would go in with a sore throat and somehow your weight becomes the issue instead. On one occasion tonsillitis turned out to be a magnificent slimming technique until I discovered 99 flake cornets were quite soothing. However the subject of my weight was tackled by doctors, their manner was often rather aggressive, with a perceptible impatience and distaste.</p><p>The new National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) guidance that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/16/dont-blame-patients-overweight-doctors-told\" title=\"\">doctors must treat obese patients with respect</a> is therefore very welcome. I don't want anyone else to go through having their fat wobbled. Nice's realisation that programmes run by Weight Watchers and Slimming World are not a \"magic bullet\" is commendable too. A female relative has been alternating between both groups for more than a year because the NHS pays for it. Her weight loss from these sessions has been nil. As she says, though, it's a \"great little social club and good to get out\".</p><p>Our obesity problem has gone way beyond the remit of most GPs. As Nice has realised, the important issues in any weight-loss journey are the individual's desire to lose weight and the reason why they are obese in the first place. In my experience this often involves deep-rooted psychological factors, which mean food is an emotional panacea. In many cases you have to address what's going on in the person's head long before you can tackle what is happening to their body.</p><p>Every doctor should have an individual approach for each patient. This softly, softly approach won't work with everyone: a friend lost five stone after being told he would never see his son get married. That would have been way too harsh for many, but the medical profession is caught on the horns of a big fat problem: what will motivate others will send others straight to an entire tub of Häagen Dazs.</p><p>We have to stop seeing doctors as the solution to what happens on our scales and simply as people who can provide a range of services that we can take advantage of – and that for many has to include psychiatric intervention. For others it's as simple as stop making excuses, eat less and move more. As adults our weight is our personal responsibility. We have to work out what we need with the help of the medical profession and not expect them to have any silver bullet – delivered in a soft or more brutal way.</p><p>What partly worked for me was a Sri Lankan gynaecologist who very gently suggested that losing some weight may help me to resume a normal menstrual cycle. He asked me what exercise I enjoyed doing – I said walking with the personal stereo in fields pretending I was in pop videos – and he told me to do it more. At 41 I still do this and it still works. My weight goes up and down – but that's my problem. As it is yours.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420238775|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|efbae671737b6e108c4720b7334fccad71d6de79 -->",

        "body":"<p>Throughout my life, whenever I have felt sad, or lonely, or abandoned, especially when there has been no apparent external reason, my mum has reacted by doing this thing. She does the thing most often when it's clear that I am struggling to cope with the world – when things become too much, and I become stressed, or depressed, or anxious, or even, rarely, apoplectic with rage. In other words, she does the thing in times of crisis. The thing is this: she looks at me, then sighs. Her chi setting switches to that of \"failed mother\", as she shakes her head ruefully and says: \"Perhaps I put you in nursery too early.\" She has done this for as long as I remember.</p><p>I thought of her this morning when I saw an article with the headline <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10384281/Children-who-spend-time-in-nurseries-more-likely-to-develop-behavioural-problems.html\" title=\"\">Children who spend time in nurseries \"more likely to develop behavioural problems\"</a> in the Daily Telegraph. The article cites a study that says exposure to some forms of early education could be linked to emotional problems. No shit, I thought, not because my mum did put me into nursery too early and I'm now suffering from deep-seated abandonment issues which manifest themselves when I'm unable to perform simple tasks such as leaving the house with ease and grace, but because it is an inevitable fact of life: human beings cause one another emotional problems. Therefore being around other human beings causes emotional problems.</p><p>The point is, the world is teaming with the emotions of people and some of them are actually really horrible. But you have to get out there sooner or later.</p><p>I can think of countless humans who have caused me emotional problems from pre-school age onwards, including myriad frenemies, flings, boyfriends and a particularly critical ex-flatmate whose vitriol regarding those around her had the power to crush the confidence of even her male physics teacher, whom she once proudly told us she had reduced to tears by telling him he was crap at his job and should just retire now, the failure. But then she once had a childminder, so what do you expect?</p><p>I realise that I am wading into a whole, loaded early-years debate, wherein people are more invested than I can even imagine, and some are even quite nasty to one another (perhaps it's time they all had some squash and some dreamy-nighty-snoozy time). But having already <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/vegetarian-parents-kids\" title=\"\">made clear how I feel about home-schooled kids in another column</a>, I might as well extend that to the under-fives.</p><p>This, however, would imply that I care about the choices other women make for their children, which I don't. What I do care about is the persistent conservative agenda regarding early years care, and how its proponents seem to think that, unless a mother is attached to her child at all times, she has basically failed as a parent. Does nursery school make children more hyperactive? Er, probably. Being put in a room with 22 other four-year-olds, all of whom are mad as a box of frogs anyway, can do that to a little fella. But it's also loads of fun. All this worrying makes me wonder just how many of these \"nurseries cause emotional problems\" articles my mother has been exposed to in her time.</p><p>Of course, mums will always blame themselves no matter what. It comes with the job. Sorry, not job, unpaid, 18-year-long internship where a bunch of people who aren't even your boss are constantly telling you how much you suck. As I have mentioned before, my little brother is severely disabled. For this my mum has persistently blamed herself, wondering if it was everything from the food she ate when she was pregnant, to the vaccinations, to her genes, to her age when she conceived, to the diet she fed him, to the epidural. The media have obviously played a massive part in this.</p><p>Perhaps it's high time that we all tell our mums to get rid of the guilt. I'm telling mine now: Mum, stop blaming yourself. There was nothing you could have done.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420233586|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|b898da6a5ad64dbc89c377d419611801926c88c7 -->",

        "headline":"Teachers do not take the decision to strike lightly",
        "body":"<p>The derision with which teachers are treated in much of the rightwing press creates the impression that it is our fault it's all gone to pot. Politicians believe the remedy is to throw more policies at the \"problem\". Meanwhile, teachers themselves are silenced in the cacophony of condemnation.</p><p>Today's co-ordinated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/17/teachers-strike-pay-thousands-schools-nasuwt\" title=\"\">strike action by the NUT and the NASUWT</a> seeks to protect our pensions and address the dismantling of our national pay system and proposals for a longer school day and year. In short, we are looking to be heard.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/08/england-young-people-league-table-basic-skills-oecd\" title=\"\">England \"is the only country in the developed world where the generation approaching retirement is more literate and numerate than the youngest adults</a>\". Some will have found the results confusing. How, at a time of year-on-year increases in the level of GCSE pass rates could we have such levels of illiteracy and innumeracy? Were poor teaching and teachers responsible? Some blame can rightly be apportioned here. Similarly, our fixation with GCSEs and league tables deserves to share in the opprobrium: it has had dire consequences for some of our young. Students in need of basic literacy and numeracy skills have been left behind by a culture which, as a result of government policy, funnelled all effort into the same narrow examination route. Teachers I have worked with over the past six years have been ringing this alarm bell to deaf ears.</p><p>Today's strike action leaves many teachers, myself included, oscillating between inertia and action. Will it serve only to alienate us from the public? How best do we fight for our rights in a climate where, it seems, a race to the bottom is a given reality? What would the acceptable public \"face\" of our strike action look like? We can begin by injecting nuance into our arguments, muddying the clear waters the education secretary, Michael Gove, insists on seeing. I am conflicted by the polarising of positions we are witnessing between the teaching unions and Gove. As a person of the left I cannot abandon my commitment to what the unions stand for. Yet I can see merit in some of Gove's ideas. Denied space in which to voice this or any other position, teachers are left with no choice but to take to the streets.</p><p>Gove's policies are often ideological, rushed and based on little evidence. They have helped to create dangerously low teacher morale. Yet under him we have seen a couple of policies that progressives can be happy with. They stand out among the many that are issued and then, thankfully, scrapped. When, a few weeks ago, Gove's department announced what was in essence the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/sep/29/headteachers-criticise-new-rules-gcse-exams\" title=\"\">scrapping of GCSE resits</a>, I and others begrudgingly admitted that this, perhaps, wasn't all that bad. Yes, the timing of the seismic shift – mid-term, weeks before the November GCSE entries – was a perfect illustration of Gove's disrespect for the profession. He might as well have said: \"To hell with schools, pupils and parents, I can make changes even when courses have already begun.\"</p><p>In spite of the above, many approved of the reform. Even the most liberal of teachers would concede that resits were open to abuse. Yet the problem was not of our making. It is successive governments that have instituted what one colleague calls an \"endless obsession with GCSE results and league tables\". It is disingenuous to accuse schools of \"gaming\" the system when the stakes are so high.</p><p>The controversy over resits in some ways best exemplifies how battlelines cannot easily be drawn. As a profession we perhaps need to instigate an open conversation with the public about the fact that some teachers, a minority, should not be in a classroom.</p><p>The education secretary has expertly played his hand over this particular policy. The unions are doing a disservice to our young by supporting incompetent and under-performing teachers, or so the argument goes. For their part the unions overlook the reality that a minority of teachers are under-performing.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/08/schools-performance-pay-teachers-education\" title=\"\">Performance-related pay </a>is, however, not the answer. Evidence the policy will improve standards is inconclusive. Yet the agenda remains. Such populism ignores teacher's warnings that pay based on performance will damage the collaborative ethos many schools have in place and lead to a toxic competitiveness from which students will suffer most.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, choosing to strike won't be easy or clear-cut. Many, anxious about the public perception, will nevertheless maintain the picket line because of the continued unwillingness by the government to either listen to teachers or view us as legitimate participants in the education debate. Teachers will take action despite being worried that in striking we merely give Gove more rope with which to hang us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420232888|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|b39f539c70aee8a6fca608f1802037c934cedea0 -->",

        "body":"<p>Is it necessary to have your own baby in order to flick on the maternal switch?</p><p>I've always thought so, as mine seems to have been permanently turned off throughout my adult life. Getting married, having babies and craving domestic bliss are not milestones I have ever dreamt of. It would have been easier if I had, because I would have done something about it and not be what I am now – a woman in my 30s, with no baby and neither desperately yearning to reproduce nor vehemently against it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/16/choice-child-free-admirable-not-selfish\" title=\"\">We're a diseased breed, women like me, viewed with suspicion because we sit on the fence</a>. It isn't normal. I repeat: it isn't normal. Is it?</p><p>Of course, I've thought about having children, but time and circumstance haven't brought them about. I thought for years that I must be missing the broody gene.</p><p>I also worried that I might not measure up if I didn't want motherhood badly enough; I might not have enough love in me if I had a child or adopted one, so I shouldn't bother just for the sake of the supposed life-affirming fulfilment that comes with it.</p><p>Now, no longer with the luxury of time on my side, I've no idea what to do. I have started coming to terms with the fact that I may never have a child, but it's not been without some lamenting. I've tried to ignore the suggestion that I'll never be a \"whole woman\" unless I find myself one day lying exhausted and bruised in a labour ward. I've told myself it wasn't meant to be, and that's OK.</p><p>But now a life-changing event I hadn't foreseen, with consequences I didn't bank on, has intervened.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/15/women-over-age-40-babies\" title=\"\">My 53-year-old mother has just had a baby boy</a> and I am ashamed to admit I spent the nine months of his development dreading his arrival. Her pregnancy was a confusing and emotionally loaded time for me. The pressure to have my own child weighed me down. If anyone was meant to be having a baby, it was me, not her. The natural order of things had been upset.</p><p>I panicked. I've never had a sibling and didn't know what to do with babies, least of all someone else's.</p><p>The fear intensified as my mother's due date inched closer, and I worried that I wouldn't connect with her child.</p><p>But as soon as I met him, my fear evaporated. It kicked in the moment I held my new half-brother, 20 minutes old, for the first time at the hospital.</p><p>As he fell asleep, curled into a ball on my chest, warm and heavy, nuzzling my neck and trusting me to hold on to him and keep him safe, I felt as if he was mine. I wanted to keep him. That moment was unlike anything I've ever felt before. It was the best feeling in the world and I never wanted it to end.</p><p>I looked at my formidable mother in awe and disbelief at what she had just done and thought, \"I love this kid. I actually love him.\"</p><p>It's a wonderful thing, being the adult sibling of a baby. I never believed I had a maternal cell in my body, but something's shifted. It may be what parents I know have tried to convey when they've said: \"It changes you.\" It could be a kind of sibling love that I've always been jealous about among my friends but have never known. Or it could, if we cast genetics aside for a moment, simply be that precious love one feels for a baby because it needs to be cared for.</p><p>Just a week old, so vulnerable and incapable of anything more than biting, sucking, crying or sleeping, he's teaching me what falling in love really is. I'm discovering it is an inescapable longing to be near him, a passionate commitment to look out for and protect him above all else.</p><p>I didn't see it coming and don't feel it leaving me any time soon.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420035290|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|b6ec923bd0ddf6ee83dd580183231d14713c2bf4 -->",

        "headline":"The London housing bubble will gobble up our capital's civic space",
        "body":"<p>I'll tell you what's wrong with the&nbsp;conversation about housing – we all know there's a market failure. Any market of essential goods that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/15/house-prices-hit-record-high\" title=\"\">most people can't afford</a> is a failure. But, in still talking about it entirely as individuals who are unable to buy what they want, we contain ourselves within a relatively small consumer space. We fight the logic of the market with the logic of … consumers who can't afford the market. But what we're really looking at is a crisis of civic space as much as a crisis of personal space.</p><p>The library I learned to read in, and where I had my first Saturday job, has been turned into a prep school. For stupid, sentimental reasons, this saddens me far more than if it had turned into flats. Spaces aren't being distributed away from all children towards rich adults, they're being taken away from all children and given to rich children. The same local authority, along with many others, is talking about selling its town hall. It's entirely reasonable.</p><p>Think how many flats you could get into one of those buildings, and how majestic their windows would be. It would solve a lot of financial crises (at least for a fortnight) in one knock, if those employees could just work from home. The entailments for local democracy would be seismic and irreversible, but it would be hard to put an actual cash value on them. The cash value of the land, meanwhile, is very easily established – and it's massive.</p><p>Local government has seemed so boring for so long that I thought that nothing they could do would be as bad as having to listen to them deciding whether to do it. I've shaken that off now. They could do some terrible things and it wouldn't even be their fault.</p><p>Naturally, this comes back to a property bubble, and the buck ends with a London property bubble. It may not seem important if you're outside London but it is, for two reasons. First, \"London\", in terms of land values, will soon translate as \"anywhere that is commutable to London\". Second, the next general election wouldn't be the first that politicians have fought entirely&nbsp;on the economics of the capital city, and it won't be the last.</p><p>The sheer, dysfunctional exclusivity of the London housing market is obvious to everyone: the fact that the coalition, with its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/help-to-buy-scheme\" title=\"\">Help to Buy scheme</a>, is answering a crisis of affordability by shovelling more money at the richest people they can find merely reflects the&nbsp;intensity of their conservatism. It&nbsp;does not suggest that they're not aware there's a problem. Everybody knows there's a problem.</p><p>David Cameron denies this will create a bubble, saying that he's empowered the Bank of England to stop a bubble being created. This is a little bit like saying you've empowered the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, to stop it raining. If the debt needed to buy a house is far more than most earn, the ratio of household debt to GDP will be very high, and banks will be over-leveraged. These are the preconditions for a housing bubble. This isn't the view of Marxist economists, it's the view of as mainstream a figure as this year's Nobel prizewinner in economics, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-shiller-nyt-housing-bubble-quote-2013-10\" title=\"\">Robert Shiller</a>.</p><p>But there is a reason why Cameron is so unruffled by the idea of a bubble, even if it's not his given reason: there is a perception – which is not, in the short-term, unfounded – that the bubble in the south-east cannot burst. The reason is foreign investment, which runs all the way from the premium properties (75% of central London newbuilds are sold abroad before they even appear on the UK market), to typically undervalued areas, like Brixton in south London, where an estate agent told me recently: \"It's actually not so much young professionals, it's foreign investment, buy-to-lets.\"</p><p>Since people still need to live in the capital, those still almost able to buy are shunted further out, and even quite distant towns take on the glister of London prices. None of this means the bubble won't burst eventually, but it does mean it will take longer than the 18 months we have to go until the election, and that when it does, the bust probably won't function in the classic way.</p><p>The house price crash of the early 1990s meant the genuine degradation of capital. Mortgage companies had fire sales and houses were auctioned, sometimes for less than they were worth. The spectacle was appalling, as well-intentioned people who'd thought they were being responsible and far-sighted were suddenly homeless.</p><p>And yet the result was that, by the mid-90s, property was affordable again. Set this against the 2007/8 sub-prime housing crash, which impacted on London prices for about five minutes.</p><p>Governments now believe that London can no longer go bust. This is probably untrue; anywhere can go bust. The <a href=\"http://arno.unimaas.nl/show.cgi?fid=10696\" title=\"\">Herengracht Canal index</a> is a record of house prices on Amsterdam's most prestigious waterway. Economists love it because it goes back to 1628. But it gives you that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias\" title=\"\">Ozymandias</a> feeling; once upon a time, that was Park Lane. Nowhere stays Park Lane forever. But if we always insulate ourselves against a bust we will, quite quickly, price ourselves out of civic space.</p><p>So, sure, we need to build more houses. We all agree on that, apart from&nbsp;– bizarrely – the people in charge. But at some point we also have to articulate the point of collective ownership, and this will inevitably entail articulating where and why developers aren't welcome, which will become where and why the investment of rest of the world isn't welcome. Either that, or remake a capital elsewhere.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420181374|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|2f9e0fb350b0530eb9b05856059d679dcdf5c029 -->",

        "body":"<p>Just as the House of Representatives was finally voting to reopen the government and save the nation from reneging on debt and inviting a downgrade, a House stenographer <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics-live/liveblog/live-updates-the-shutdown-9/?id=c7c5125a-dbc6-48e0-80e9-3302f05ac32b\">appears to have suffered a breakdown</a>. Grabbing the microphone, she started defending God's honour before the nation.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He will not be mocked. The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. The constitution would not have been written by freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters.</p></blockquote><p>After being removed and questioned, she was taken away for psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>Her mental health is no laughing matter. But the <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/16/this-is-not-one-nation-under-god-house-stenographer-taken-from-the-floor-after-bizarre-outburst/\">description of her interjection by much of the media as a \"bizarre\" interruption to the House vote</a> deserves interrogation.</p><p>Because everything about this was bizarre. From the moment <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\">Ted Cruz got up and started quoting Ashton Kutcher and talking about Star Wars</a> into the wee hours, this entire process has been nothing but bizarre. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\">America, once again, took the familiar road</a> from the height of dysfunction to the brink of default – until reality grabbed it by the scruff of the neck and slapped it straight, before it did itself and others grave harm.</p><p>Because America is powerful, the world has to take notice of these self-inflicted crises. But because it has become so predictably dysfunctional and routinely reckless, they are difficult to take seriously or, at times, even fathom. To the rest of the world and much of America, this is yet another dangerous folly. The fact that the nation did not default should come as cold comfort. The fact that we are even talking about it defaulting is a problem.</p><p>This particular flirtation with fate was driven by a visceral opposition to the moderate provision of something most western nations take for granted: healthcare. The reforms they opposed had been been passed by the very body of which they are a member and had been been approved by the US supreme court, the guardian of the very constitution they claimed to be defending. For this, they started a fight they never had the numbers to win and carried on waging it long after it was clear they had lost.</p><p>\"We're not going to be disrespected,\" <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\">insisted Republican Indiana Congressman Marlin Stutzman</a>, last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>Nor did anyone else. That's why the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/17/us/congress-budget-debate.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Republicans went down to humiliating defeat</a>. As South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham admitted:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We took some bread crumbs and left an entire meal on the table. This has been a really bad two weeks for the Republican party.</p></blockquote><p>But to couch this episode only as a Democratic victory would really miss the point. For the process by which such a shutdown and breakdown could happen is not just the work of a few cranky Tea Party types. It is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/shutdown-us-government-republican-party\">rooted in an electoral system that is heavily gerrymandered</a>, where only those who can pay, can play. The reason the Republican dissenters could proceed with such unstrategic zeal is because they are in safe, rigged seats and so risk no challenge at the polls.</p><p>Indeed, given that they only have to fear nomination within their own party, rather than election by the nation at large, there is an incentive to act out in this way because it appeals to the base. When constituencies are so heavily contorted in the interests of incumbents that there is precious little consequence to anything a politician does, then <a href=\" http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/19/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-house-democrats-won-majority-2012-popu/\">you don't really have a democracy</a>, you just have the vote.</p><p>This temporary resolution buys them time, but it does not by them any real solution – since there is absolutely nothing to prevent a repeat performance. Which is what it is: a performance. As said Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid put it on Wednesday night:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I'm tired. Concluding this crisis is historic. But let's be honest: this was pain inflicted on the nation for no good reason. We cannot … we cannot, cannot make the same mistakes again.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, they can. Almost certainly, they will.<br /></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420250081|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|070e346c4c45736cf3528fdce34ada4160dc7e2d -->",

        "body":"<p>On 1 October, democracy was officially suspended in the US people's House of Representatives.</p><p>Now, two weeks in to the federal shutdown, we are living with the results. Millions of Americans are going without important government services, and hundreds of thousands of hardworking civil servants are being forced to go without pay while bills pile up and mortgages come due. Children with cancer are being <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/19kyUsv\">turned away from experimental drug trials</a> at the National Institutes of Health. The Center for Disease Control is left <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/health/flu-season-may-be-starting-feds-furlough-cant-track-it-8C11329868\">without enough manpower to track the spread of the flu</a>, potentially leaving vulnerable populations at risk. Small business owners are finding it <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1bc51tF\">difficult to secure loans</a>. And the list goes on – <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-08/shutdown-costs-at-1-6-billion-with-160-million-each-day.html\">to the tune of $160m</a> or more in lost economic activity every day.</p><p>It didn't have to be this way. There are enough votes in the House to pass the Senate's \"clean\" bill to fund government – and this already represents Democrats being willing to compromise to accept the GOP's post-sequester funding levels for the short term. It would have easily passed the House with a bipartisan majority – had the House Republican leadership brought it to the floor for a simple up-or-down vote. But House Republicans – <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/rachel-maddow/53151808\">many of whom have long had the goal of shutting down the government</a> – effectively wrote the shutdown into law with just hours left on the clock.</p><p>If that sounds unbelievable and outrageous, it's because it is.</p><p>The chairman of the House rules committee conceded that, under normal procedure with clause 4 of rule 22, if the House amends a Senate bill and the Senate rejects the House's amendment(s), <em>any</em> House member has the right to bring the original Senate bill up for an immediate up-or-down vote in the House. But just two hours before the government was poised to shut down, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd-iaYLO1A&amp;sns=tw\">House Republicans quietly rigged the rules in their favor</a>. They changed that rule to ensure that <em>only</em> Republican majority leader Eric Cantor could bring the Senate bill to reopen the government up for a vote – something they have refused to do.</p><p>The Republicans thought they would get away with this. They had assumed that voters would not notice this egregious display of power and would overlook the fact that they had fundamentally changed the way our representative democracy operates. But they were wrong.</p><p>This past Saturday, on the House floor, as almost 200 Democrats lined up to sign a petition to open the government, I called the Republicans out on their manipulation of the rules – and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd-iaYLO1A&amp;sns=tw\">video of the exchange has already been viewed nearly 3m times</a>.</p><p>While it involves arcane parliamentary procedure, this issue is fundamental to our democracy. The public recognizes what's at stake in this debate. They recognize that rigging the rules to keep the government shut down makes a mockery of the democratic process in the people's House.</p><p>It's time to stop stalling and allow democracy to work its will. If Speaker Boehner would simply allow the House of Representatives to work as it was designed to, we could open the government immediately.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420148929|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|0a3a1b0bb0c24aaeb48bf0e6655ab9fa8830635b -->",

        "body":"<p>Much as many people didn't realize how much they depended on government services until they stopped, there are some heretofore obscure Washington figures who have only found the spotlight since, well, the electricity went off. No one knows if their fame will last longer than the debt ceiling, but here's a few political players the shutdown has brought to the frontlines.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420072567'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381873448857/black_140x140.jpg' alt='Senate Chaplain Barry Black' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Senate Chaplain <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/reference/office/chaplain.htm\">Barry Black</a>:</strong> Black has gotten attention lately because his opening prayers have taken on a biting tone easily appropriated by either liberals or conservatives. He's <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/10/07/save-us-from-the-madness-senate-chaplain-scolds-politicians-stubborn-pride-and-smugness-during-daily-invocations/\">implored</a> God to \"save us from the madness\", and \"Deliver us from the hypocrisy of attempting to sound reasonable while being unreasonable.\"</p><p>Prior to Black's strident scolding, you probably didn't even know that the Senate and the House each have a paid member of the clergy who serves their pastoral counselor and officiant. It's a little weird! And controversial, not just in this day and age of rampant secular humanism. In <a href=\"http://chaplain.house.gov/chaplaincy/ChaplainHistoryCRS.pdf\">1854 (pdf)</a>, responding to criticisms that the position violated the principle of separation of church and state (you think?), the House judiciary committee put forward a resolution just stop electing them. And for a short time, they didn't, relying on volunteers to do the opening prayer and minister to officials. The practice of paying an official chaplain for each body resumed after Congress had difficulty finding church leaders to do it for free.</p><p>Normally, if you have trouble finding people to pray for you, it's time to ask if, maybe, there's a reason for that – like, maybe, even those whose religious beliefs mandate charity don't have any sympathy for you? But paying someone to pray for you, that's another way to go, I guess. The chaplains are paid well, by the way: the House position pays $172,000 and the Senate's $155,500. While civilian chaplains have had their contracts suspended during the shutdown (much to the right's outrage), it seems that Black and his House counterpart, <a href=\"http://chaplain.house.gov/\">Father Pat Conroy</a>, are either essential or have found in their hearts a compassion less present in the 1850s.</p><p>Both the <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/13/inside-the-beltway-seeking-enlightened-conservatis/?page=all\">right</a> and <a href=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/ken-shepherd/2013/10/04/msnbcs-martin-bashir-uses-senate-chaplains-prayers-condemn-republicans\">left</a> have tried to claim Black as an ally. To be sure, the even-handedness of his tone plays well into the conservative narrative that it's the \"refusal to negotiate\" on \"both sides\" that's the problem. But Republicans looking for a mole in the chamber are probably out of luck. While he hasn't made his personal political leanings clear, last year Black <a href=\"http://rolandmartinreports.com/blog/2012/03/trayvon-martin-resonates-african-american-senate-chaplain-tells-own-story/\">joined</a> a \"Hoodies on the Hill\" protest organized by congressional staffers to call attention to the Trayvon Martin case and NYPD's stop-and-frisk policies.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420072568'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381873484750/costa_140x140.jpg' alt='National Review journalist Robert Costa' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/author/robert-costa\">Robert Costa</a>, Washington editor of the National Review:</strong> Costa's deep sourcing in the conservative movement, combined with his refusal to spin for it, have led to his emergence as the <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115179/robert-costa-interview-national-review-reporter-talks-about-shutdown\">dominating force</a> in shutdown coverage. He's consistently broken stories about the direction the House Republican caucus is headed (or not headed, as the case may be), and turned up a lot on MSNBC as a \"conservative-to-English\" translator. (Have less fact-based conservatives noticed this? <a href=\"http://www.mofopolitics.com/2013/10/09/robert-costa-do-conservatives-understand-defunding-obamacare-is-undemocratic-great-question/\">Yes, they have noticed this</a>.)</p><p>Though they are often drowned out by the lunatic ravings of <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/author/maggie-gallagher\">homophobes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/04/a-quick-word-on-john-derbyshire/255576/\">racists</a>, with whom they sometimes share a masthead, a handful of serious reporters who just happen to be conservative have always been a part of the mix at the National Review: <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/author/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>, the currently <a href=\"http://spectator.org/archives/2013/10/09/the-legend-of-cory-booker\">freelancing</a> <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/author/daniel-foster\">Daniel Foster</a>, and, now at the <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/author/byron-york\">Washington Examiner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/author/byron-york\">Byron York</a>, just to name a few. They've been the true heirs to William Buckley's legacy, doing critical but fair coverage of a political cohort they're a part of, which, presumably, they believe will be made better by honest appraisal rather than sycophantic echoes.</p><p>No one should be surprised that this leads to great journalism. (York's 2001 piece in the Atlantic, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/11/the-life-and-death-of-the-american-spectator/302343/\">\"The Life and Death of the American Spectator\"</a>, is riveting long-form journalism, period. But it's also a fascinating portrait of a movement meltdown from an insider's perspective.) What's most remarkable about Costa's stories is that he truly resists judgment of the GOP's tactics, though MSNBC hosts seem desperate to have him do so – and their questions lean toward the \"Have they stopped beating their wives yet?\" <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/martin-bashir/53237711#53237711\">variety</a>.</p><p>I imagine Costa agrees with many of the Republicans' goals, but he presents his shutdown-related play-by-play with admirable restraint. There should probably be more of this kind of reporting on the left, though you could argue that's what the New York Times is for. All too often, the mainstream media only rewards with attention those conservatives whose <em>opinions</em> are ideologically acceptable (that is, \"moderate\") with the label of \"reasonable\" – and, hey, I like those guys, too! They should get attention: they are probably the future of the party. But Costa's emergence is a reminder that smart, honest reporting, aka \"truth\", doesn't have a party.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-420072569'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/15/1381873524420/yoho_140x140.jpg' alt='Florida Rep Ted Yoho' width='140' height='140' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Representative Ted Yoho (Republican, Florida):</strong> Look, there are <em>hundreds</em> of members of Congress, and a lot of crazy, so the media can't be expected to keep track of all of them. And why search out fresh crazy when you can keep picking the low-hanging fruits of Reps Michele (\"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/michele-bachmann-end-times_n_4060063.html\">The end is near</a>!\") Bachmann (Republican, Minnesota) and Louie (\"<a hre=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02/louie-gohmert-magazine-limits_n_3000911.html\">Ammo restrictions will make you marry a dog</a>!\") Gohmert (Republican, Texas). And, obviously, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bachmann-to-hannity-this-is-about-the-happiest-gop-has-been-in-a-while/\">Bachmann</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/13/louie-gohmert-impeach_n_4094707.html\">Gohmert</a> have delivered shutdown howlers.</p><p>Yet, Yoho has distinguished himself with shutdown-related opining at a frequency and level of crazy reporters cannot resist: he is a <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-deniers-ted-yoho-district-2013-10\">debt-default denier</a>, <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/10/15/shutdowns-radical-birther-streak-cannot-be-igno/196428\">an Obama birther</a>, and <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-10-04/politics/42717248_1_government-shutdown-freshman-congressman-tremor\">believes</a> himself to be \"like Fred and Barney in the Flintstone-mobile, trying to stop\" the country from \"heading into socialism\". (Yoho's wife <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=3F489698-8016-4D18-8A82-6227BEC86D7C\">warned</a> Politico, early on: \"He's not going to go be the brightest guy on the Hill.\")</p><p>I don't honestly believe that Yoho represents most Republicans, but he does honestly represent his district, where he won as a Tea Party insurgent in a primary against 23-year House veteran Cliff Stearns. This Business Insider reporter tried to find Yoho critics in his district, but, instead, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/debt-ceiling-deniers-ted-yoho-district-2013-10\">found</a> constituents echoing Yoho's belief that worries about busting the debt ceiling are \"scare tactics\" and the way to significantly cut government spending is to cut foreign aid (less than 1% of spending) and the \"federal arts\" (<em>much</em> less than 1% of spending).</p><p>Yoho seems to be enjoying his moment (YOLO Yoho!), but if he gets his way, he and all the other debt-ceiling deniers will face a moment of reckoning that could be their undoing: Unlike those who deny climate change or even cling to the idea that Obama is a secret Muslim, they cannot continue to live in conspiracy-warped hypotheticals. <em>Something</em> is going to happen if we breach the debt ceiling; if it's the nothingburger that Yoho predicts, well, I'll consider us all lucky and look forward to mocking Rep Yoho for years into the future – as his constituents vote him in with content smugness. If we breach it and everything goes pear-shaped, well, it's not like the end of his career will make me feel <em>better</em>. But it won't hurt.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420070604|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|f0edfe158889a88f01ec3348a935f9d30365f36d -->",

        "headline":"Nuclear diplomacy, not force, offers the safest, surest route to rein in Iran",
        "body":"<p>With the latest round of nuclear talks between Iran and the P5+1 world powers only in its first day, a global agreement to ration second world war references is sorely needed. Commentators have invoked Churchill, <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Iranian-Threat/News/Steinitz-Iran-may-want-an-agreement-but-its-liable-to-be-Munich-agreement-326936\">Munich</a> and Hitler – with some North Korea references thrown in – to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/15/cannot-verify-trust-iran-nuclear-weapons\">argue that Iran's nuclear program, and the Tehran regime's ideology, represent such a threat that nothing but a military response will do</a>.</p><p>It's time for a dose of reality, however. One needn't see Iran's newly-elected President Rouhani as benign, or even as a profound break from the clerical regime's policies, in order to survey the facts and conclude – as a broad, bipartisan consensus of military and security leaders has done – that the deal on the table is the best way forward.</p><p>As Ken Pollack notes in his recent survey of US-Iran policy options, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/books/review/unthinkable-by-kenneth-m-pollack.html?_r=0\">Unthinkable</a>, we aren't really sure what the regime's goals are – and it may not be either. However, if we begin by imagining that some of the more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/15/cannot-verify-trust-iran-nuclear-weapons\">pessimistic assumptions are correct</a> – that Iran will seek regional dominance and nuclear weapons capability no matter what, and attempt to cheat on any agreement that is reached – the arguments for a negotiated settlement, even a less-than-perfect one, don't get weaker. They may actually get stronger.</p><p>If Iran's leaders are truly bent on regional or even world domination, they're doing a terrible job. In just the last five years, Iran's regional image has plunged as it repressed its own \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/iran-tehran-ayotollah-khamenei-protests\">green revolution</a>\", while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline\">other Middle Eastern societies</a>, where citizens made similar calls for genuine, representative democracy and an end to corruption, had greater success.</p><p>Hostility toward the Shia sect of Islam, of which Tehran rules the world's largest concentration, has grown into open talk of regional warfare, with the battlefield spreading from Syria. The pressures of the Arab awakenings and Sunni-Shia tensions lost Iran its Palestinian ally, Hamas, which had been a key tool to Iran's ability to harass and threaten Israel; Tehran no longer has any influence on Hamas's actions.</p><p>Iran now faces global opprobrium for the actions of its Syrian ally. Its military and cyber aid have failed to be decisive for Bashar al-Assad, but they do serve as another drain on Iran's sanctions-stressed treasury and as a source of popular resentment abroad. Now, instead of overseeing a solid Shia crescent through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon – poised to threaten Turkey, Israel and the Gulf – Tehran presides over three weak or tottering regimes, plus its ally Hezbollah, which it pressured to turn away from its anti-Israel focus to make an all-or-nothing bet on propping up Assad in Syria.</p><p>This kind of regional activity can be acknowledged as dangerous for the US and our allies – but because Iran is weak, not because it is strong.</p><p>If the Iranian regime is going to hanker for nuclear weapons capability no matter what, would we prefer to have its activity completely unsupervised and unknown? Or would we prefer to have inspectors intrusively swarming over the country's facilities, catching sight of things they weren't supposed to see, getting tips, and able to offer advance warning should Iran mount an uranium enrichment rush for a bomb? This is the flip side of the North Korea example: Pyongyang was most able to surprise outsiders when it had little or no outside observation.</p><p>Under such a scenario, an agreement that <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-iran-nuclear-talks-20131014,0,2879074.story\">broadens and deepens</a> Iran's inspection regime, takes away its most-enriched uranium (20%), and commits Iran to living under the terms of the international agreements that other non-nuclear weapons states have accepted actually makes the US and our allies more secure, not less.</p><p>Above all, it gains time. By removing Iran's most-enriched uranium, the number of months or years it would take Tehran to successfully complete a bomb increases substantially, giving us more warning. This is the same result proponents of an <a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/2013/09/dangerous-rouhani-diplomacy.html\">Israeli bombing raid</a> say they want, while admitting such a raid would, in fact, not end the program. But an agreement achieves this without splintering the coalition arrayed against Iran or unleashing retaliation on the US and its allies – or killing Iranians.</p><p>And finally, yes, Iran gets some sanctions relief. But this, too, gives the west leverage – because those sanctions can be reinstated if Iran cheats; and because the international community, and ordinary Iranians, see that the west is willing to reward as well as punish. This, in turn, reinforces the voices within Iran who want to reform or overturn the clerical system and turn away not only from nuclear weapons but from support for Assad, terrorism, and internal repression. And that, again, is what the <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/sns-201310090930--tms--vdhansonctnvh-a20131010-20131010,0,7998025.column\">Hitler alarmists</a> say they want for Iran – that, and blue jeans.</p><p>A smart negotiation strategy combines carrots and sticks to build leverage, and recognizes what is worth spending leverage for; a foolish one involves taking nothing but sticks. We will learn much, soon, about whether political leaders who know a carrot in their own states can recognize them in an international setting.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420060951|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|35f8c965ad3cc36cfac196a5644015e7b5c83fc3 -->",

        "body":"<p>Herman Carnie and Charles Meng are on the front lines of poverty in America. They direct food banks that serve thousands of families each week. Charles Meng heads the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=f&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.afac.org/&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;ei=nrNdUrOaDZCY0QWS34HwCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtU3LImbkZ2GJWxN53W0vZxgcFrA\">Arlington Food Assistance Center</a> in a suburb of Washington, and Herman Carnie is director of food acquisition at the<a href=\"http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/site/PageServer\"> Greater Chicago Food Depository</a>. They are opening up today about their typical work day, the people they serve and how what happens in Washington can impact America's poor. <strong>Post questions below in the comments and they will check back later in the day.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/oct/15/help-us-report-on-americas-food-banks\">Do you have a story? Help us report on America's food banks.</a> </strong></p><h2>1. What's your typical day like? </h2><p><strong>Charles Meng (Arlington, Virginia): </strong>The typical day starts with our drivers picking up perishable and non-perishable food donations from the various grocery stores, bakeries and specialty stores which are delivered back to the Arlington Food Assistance Center warehouse. Our daily distribution begins with the arrival of our volunteer team to stock our shelves, sort donations that arrived overnight and assist our families in choosing the foods they need. While distribution begins at 9:30am, a line has normally formed by 8AM. Our mornings are very busy while the afternoon brings more individual and team volunteers to repackage produce and other foods that we buy in bulk, rice beans, and oatmeal. For example, every Wednesday night our chicken bagging team repackages bulk cases of chicken into 3 lb packages. Another dedicated volunteer team picks up food donations from the two nearby and very generous Trader Joe's grocery stores.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie (Chicago): </strong>No two days are the same. I'm responsible for managing our food sourcing, inventory and transportation teams. Our facility is a 268,000 square-foot warehouse and distribution center located on Chicago's southwest side. It's a massive effort across the board for our organization to run smoothly. I arrive at 5:30am when the building opens and attend a 6am meeting where we review routes and assignments with our truck drivers. From that point forward my focus is on sourcing food and managing inventory.</p><p>Donations are the primary way we receive food. Shelf-stable food donations have dwindled in recent years, so we make a concerted effort to contact food manufacturers. If we get a call that there's a truckload in Cook County, we make plans to get the food. A phone call can change your day. We manage our inventory across 18 core food categories. If we're short on any item, we look to purchase. Healthy options are the biggest thing. It's a balancing act – we provide food for children so we're looking for nutritious items that kids will enjoy. At the same time, we also serve older adults, so foods that are easy to open and prepare are a necessity.</p><h2>2. How many people does your food bank typically help?</h2><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> Currently we are serving 1,517 families each week – that is 3,531 individuals, a third of whom are children under the age of 18. At the start of the recession, we were serving about 650 families each week. At our peak in February, 2012 we were serving 1,707 families each week – an increase of 262%.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> We provide food through a network of 650 pantries, soup kitchens and shelters. In the community we serve, more than 860,000 people are food insecure. This means 1 in 6 people is unsure where their next meal will come from. People are hungry all year-round. I volunteer every month at a pantry, and I see that many of the other people volunteering are now in line for food, too – they need the support. More people are in need of work. </p><h2>3. What's the craziest/most unexpected thing that's ever happened to you while on the job?</h2><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> A local women suggested, in all seriousness, that we find hunters who could kill and dress the deer foraging in her backyard so that we could serve it to our families. I referred her to the local animal welfare league.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Four years ago, a donor came up with the idea of planting 20 acres of sweet corn to give to us. In the first year, we harvested 71,366 pounds of corn with the help of a farmer and our volunteers. We've now added five acres of squash, and have harvested more than 625,000 pounds of food total. In a few hours the corn and squash goes from the field into the hands of people in need. </p><h2>4. What do you wish politicians and more of the public would understand about poverty and hunger in America? </h2><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Any cut to programs affects people in a huge way, especially with SNAP (food stamps). We can't fill that gap, and the need won't go away. Every food stream that we have now will be tapped to a higher level. We have a team that helps to sign people up for SNAP. It's hard-working people who are just trying to make ends meet. There actually are a lot of people who are eligible for SNAP who don't know it's available. A lot of it is tied to red tape.</p><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> Hunger has a pernicious effect on all who suffer from it – children go to school hungry cannot focus on their studies as they need to, the elderly skip meals or go to the local fast food establishment where everything is high salt, high fat and high sugar, parents must work two and three jobs just to make ends meet but they never do meet, and pregnant mothers who do not have the resources to feed themselves and their growing child. The effects are a huge burden carried by our schools, our medical care system and our economy through higher costs, service demands and in numerous other smaller and larger ways.</p><h2>5. What makes for a really good day on the job? </h2><p><strong>Charles Meng:</strong> The best part of my job is being thanked by our grateful clients. And, it is not frequently on the job but rather on the street, or in a store where a cashier will stop me and say \"thanks for what you do\".</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Our team volunteers in the community a few times each year. This is an opportunity for us to see how grateful they are for the food they receive. It pulls it all together. </p><h2>6. Has the shutdown had an impact on your organization or the people you serve? </h2><p><strong>Charles Meng: </strong>In the last two weeks of September, we saw an increase of 96 families. We cannot tell yet if this is just because of the change in seasons or attributable to the government shutdown. However, while we are serving 1,500 families each week, we have over 2,500 active referrals, which means that any economic change, whether it be gas and food prices or a shutdown, will cause more families to come to us for help rather quickly.</p><p><strong>Herman Carnie:</strong> Not yet, but the shutdown could affect the people we serve if it doesn't end soon. We often ask ourselves: how do we continue to fill the widening gap.</p><h2>7. What do you think will happen when <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3899\">food stamp benefits are reduced</a> on 1 November?</h2><p><strong>Charles Meng: </strong> Any reduction will drive more families to come to AFAC for help. Here in Arlington the average SNAP benefit is $28.21 a week ($4 a day). That is not much for a family of four to live on. We provide supplemental groceries – fresh fruit and vegetables, mike, eggs, chicken, fish, a number of staples, cereals and an assortment of canned goods.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/420070378|2013-10-17T12:53:14Z|9974d7b9304114c2b85a3d777407efa376a5c4a7 -->",
