Once described as “the best technology conference on the planet”, the gathering is a seething mass of startups pitching ideas, investors looking for the next Google or Facebook, tech thinkers talking about the latest trends, and the odd celebrity giving their visions for the future. Here is what we learned at this year’s meeting of techie minds.</p> <p><strong>Tinder says it’s about long-term love, not short-lived thrills</strong></p> <p>Dating app <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/tinder\">Tinder</a> is often seen as being purely about the “hook-ups” – people meeting for casual sex. The company’s CEO, Sean Rad, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/05/tinder-app-users-casual-sex-long-term-relationships\">claimed otherwise at the summit</a>, saying that a survey of 300,000 Tinder users found that “over 80% of people on Tinder are there to find a long-term relationship”. The other 20% are there for “things more short-term: either friendships or … dare I say, hook-ups. Very brief friendships!”</p> <p>Rad also offered stats to illustrate Tinder’s growth: its users collectively go on 1.5 million dates every week, while every day they swipe through 1.8 billion potential mates, with the app making 30 million daily matches.</p> <p>He also made the case for Tinder being more meaningful than other social apps: “You’re not going to remember the photo you saw on Snapchat two hours ago. You are going to remember the person you met on Tinder even weeks ago.”</p> <p><strong>Could virtual reality’s killer app be education?</strong></p> <p>Oculus VR is the virtual-reality company bought by Facebook for $2bn, which is planning to launch its Oculus Rift headset in 2016. While games were its initial focus, founder Palmer Luckey <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/oculus-vr-founder-classrooms-are-broken\">suggested that education might be a key area</a> for virtual reality technology.</p> <p>“I think there’s a lot of potential for virtual reality in the education industry … Classrooms are broken. Kids don’t learn the best by reading books,” he said. “There’s clearly value in real-world experiences: going to do things. That’s why we have field trips. The problem is that the majority of people will never be able to do the majority of those experiences.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"77651280eb4107df1695b224a07709fa8d3736f6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/77651280eb4107df1695b224a07709fa8d3736f6/0_93_2784_1672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyberpsychologist Mary Aiken\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyberpsychologist Mary Aiken, who studies online behaviour, speaking to the conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Cybercriminal motives? Ask them about their mother…</strong></p> <p>One of the summit talks that made waves beyond Dublin came from cyberpsychologist Mary Aiken, who studies online behaviour. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/hackers-gonna-hack-but-why-maybe-freud-has-the-answer\">She suggested</a> that criminal hackers may have motivations beyond revenge, profit or maliciousness.</p> <p>“My favourite explanation in academic literature is a Freudian psychoanalytic approach to hacking, which actually conceptualises hacking in Freudian terms as a cybersexual urge to penetrate,” she said. “And there are castration complex overtones in terms of being cut off from the network as well.”</p> <p>But Aiken also said that society needs to stop thinking about hacking as a negative, menacing thing, pointing out that, in cases where teenagers have been caught hacking companies, hitting them with the full force of the law may be the wrong approach. “As a society, do we really want to criminalise 13-, 14- and 15-year-olds? Or do we want to understand their behaviour, engage with their incredible skillsets, mentor them and try to point them in the right direction?”</p> <p><strong>Drones can be used for good, not evil</strong></p> <p>DJI is one of the companies making consumer drones – “flying robots with high-quality cameras attached”, in the words of executive Randy Braun. He said that while much media attention focused on nefarious uses for drones, better examples are coming: “Based on what I read in my local newspaper, we’re sort of the bad guys. We’re the ones spying on our next-door neighbours in their backyard. We’re the ones flying up the high-rise buildings and peeking in the windows, right? We’re kind of deviant too, we’re the ones dropping bags of marijuana into the prisons these days!” he said. “We really don’t read a lot of good news about small drones in the media. But it’s coming.”</p> <p>DJI is trying to help that by working with humanitarian organisations: Braun showed off a project involving its drones being used in Nepal to map and scan areas damaged by April’s earthquake, to help people plan for any future disasters. Elsewhere at the summit, footage shot by drones flying over active volcanoes showed the potential for aerial robotics to help us understand the natural world.</p> <p><strong>Kickstarter picks social impact over Silicon Valley riches</strong></p> <p>Crowdfunding service Kickstarter recently passed $2bn of pledges since its launch in 2009. And the company also recently turned its back on the prospect of being bought or going public in a lucrative “exit”, instead transforming itself into a “public benefit corporation”, obliged to think more about its impact on society than its potential riches from selling up. Its CEO, Yancey Strickler, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/kickstarter-chooses-public-good-over-private-riches\">delivered a polite but clear message</a> to the technology world.</p> <p>“Every giant corporation started as a small company, but at some point they lost their soul. I think there are other entrepreneurs and people like us that want to do something more than just survive or get rich,” he said. “They shouldn’t be forced to put aside their strong beliefs just to get that cheque.” He also criticised Silicon Valley culture. “So much of the zeitgeist in the world of business and technology and startups is about ‘be more aggressive than the next guy, be harder, be faster, be paranoid’. All these things. It’s all wrong. Being patient, thoughtful, creative, trying to make the right decisions. That’s what matters.”</p> <p><strong>Ford’s future is more than cars and trucks</strong></p> <p>“We have to make great cars and trucks today, but we also have to imagine a future of transportation as a service,” said Bill Ford, great-grandson of Henry Ford, and executive chairman of the motor firm that he founded. “What if a car could stop just being a method of transportation, and what if a car could start solving problems for people?” he asked.</p> <p>Ford said current technological trends represent the biggest disruption in the history of the car industry. “If you think of this industry, we’ve been revolution-resistant for 100 years. If you look at the business model of our industry from when my great-grandfather started Ford, it didn’t really change a lot,” he said. Self-driving cars are one of those challenges. “We used to talk about autonomous driving as 25 to 30 years away. Well no, it’s not,” he said. “The pace of change is always going to come at us much faster than we thought.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1b56811546bffc14d1919b865b65fac3bc76c0a\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/10/1447164223555/5202947e-009f-4a18-b334-21c1aec23282-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dance-music star Steve Angello told the summit about his unconventional plans to release his next album.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dance-music star Steve Angello told the summit about his unconventional plans to release his next album.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naoise Culhan / SPORTSFILE / Web Summit/Naoise Culhan / SPORTSFILE / Web Summit/SPORTSFILE/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In the streaming age, the album is evolving</strong></p> <p>As Spotify nears 100 million users, and services like Apple Music and Google Play Music continue to grow, the way music is released may be changing. Dance-music star Steve Angello explained how his forthcoming <em>Wild Youth</em> album will be released unconventionally: “I’ve decided to split my album and do chapters, where we have a pre-order that releases a couple of tracks. Then we go into a chapter of the album, which is going to be half the album. Then we present six videos, then we go into the second half, then we go with six other videos,” he said.</p> <p>“Kids today are different from what they used to be. We have kids that are spending eight, nine hours a day on their phones on social media … So for me to split it up, it’s going to make it more interesting for me and the fans, because they can be part of it. And if you’re trying to tell a story today with an album, you need their attention.”</p> <p><strong>Twitter is changing online satire</strong></p> <p>On Twitter, anyone can fire off one-liners in response to topical events. That’s upping the pressure on satirical websites like The Onion to be funnier. “There is more pressure to be quick,” said its president, Michael McAvoy. “The bigger point is: are you commenting on something in a unique enough way that, even if you don’t have the first joke, you have the best joke?”</p> <p>He also said that sites like The Onion are finding partnerships with big brands, which want to associate themselves with comedy sites even if they’re spiky. “For us, it has always been through advertising, yet The Onion also has this anti-establishment ethos. It’s a delicate balance,” he said. “The right brands understand that to reach people under 35, you need to do something different, and the best way to do something authentic is through comedy. Be in on the joke, and don’t take yourself too seriously.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10956505","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403066","internalRevision":"111","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Dublin played host to one of the world’s largest startup gatherings","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Drones, hackers and online satire: eight lessons from a global tech fest","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Stuart Dredge","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T00:04:03Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d6fb1124d5fddf98097b02a9cb7441cdf9dd090/0_0_3814_2294/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2ac","wordcount":"1423","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d6fb1124d5fddf98097b02a9cb7441cdf9dd090/0_0_3814_2294/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563cfc1ce4b0ace666f8b88c","newspaperPageNumber":"28","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T00:04:03Z","standfirst":"<p>Dublin played host to one of the world’s largest startup gatherings</p>","linkText":"Drones, hackers and online satire: eight lessons from a global tech fest","creationDate":"2015-11-06T19:14:36Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-10T14:03:50Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458350558"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/08/dublin-web-summit-things-learned-tinder-drones-apps","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2015/nov/08/dublin-web-summit-things-learned-tinder-drones-apps","sectionName":"Technology","elements":[{"id":"4d6fb1124d5fddf98097b02a9cb7441cdf9dd090","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d6fb1124d5fddf98097b02a9cb7441cdf9dd090/0_0_3814_2294/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

Unemployment is stubbornly high, good jobs scarce, and, to top it all, the coastal town is embroiled in a highly public spat with Jeremy Clarkson, who recently called it a “cesspit of awfulness and disease”.</p> <p>Now it is grappling with another problem. Spice, the street name for synthetic cannabis, has ravaged homeless communities in some of the UK’s most deprived regions, particularly the north of England and south Wales.</p> <p>“It’s growing in popularity; it’s horrible to watch,” said Helen Gavaghan, a “navigator” for <a href=\"http://www.blackpoolfulfillinglives.org.uk/default.aspx\">Blackpool Fulfilling Lives</a>, an organisation that works with some of the town’s most vulnerable people. Although spice, a former legal high, was banned in 2009, the brand name is now used for similar drugs manufactured in China and east Asia that mimic the effects of cannabis and which are sold, often legally, by online retailers and in the UK’s 350 head shops.</p> <p>“Spice is a generic name for a bewildering range of synthetic compounds that bear no relationship to the cannabis plant except that the chemicals hit the same receptors in the brain that cannabis does,” said Harry Shapiro, a drug information analyst. “When we test the mixtures of [spice] compounds, we find that some of them have been banned and some haven’t. We are seeing some very ill people who have been using synthetic cannabinoids.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbd0eccb55a55cdeb634bf72a5d1c6206fd8c1bc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/bbd0eccb55a55cdeb634bf72a5d1c6206fd8c1bc/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Synthetic cannabis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A synthetic cannabis user prepares to roll a joint.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few years ago the homeless in some of Blackpool’s most deprived areas – the town centre, South Shore and Central Drive – would be using alcohol or heroin. Now spice is often their drug. In Blackpool, a gram costs between £5 and £10 – enough, Gavaghan said, “to make 20 spliffs that will get 40 people out of it”.</p> <p>“It’s popular with people with no money because it’s cheaper, it’s stronger, so a small amount lasts a lot longer,” she said. “Two or three tokes and you’re in oblivion. People on it, they’re not in there any more. They can walk around but their face is flat, they’re not really hearing. Often they’re aggressive. Their empathy has been turned off.”</p> <p>This experience is not unique to Blackpool. Research by Northumbria University, in Newcastle, has found that legal highs are fuelling a spike in antisocial behaviour and aggressive begging across the north-east of England. Last year in Newcastle alone, more than 1,100 police hours were spent dealing with incidents related to legal highs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/05/theresa-may-legal-highs-ban-unenforceable-government-advisers\">Theresa May's legal highs ban is unenforceable, say government advisers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Across the country, police incidents involving legal highs have more than doubled in two years. Officers from 32 forces in England attended 3,807 incidents in 2014 – up from 1,431 the previous year, according to research by the <a href=\"http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/\">Centre for Social Justice</a>.</p> <p>Amid mounting concern, Public Health England issued a national alert to healthcare workers earlier this year, warning of the rising harm from spice, also known as black mamba, the side effects of which include vomiting, seizures, psychosis and, in some cases, death. The drug’s notoriety has seen it enter the lexicon. Users now refer to “mambulances”, due to the large numbers of users being rushed to A&amp;E by paramedics.</p> <p>In the US its impact on homeless communities is proving devastating, with scores of deaths reported monthly. The American Association of Poison Control Centres reports that visits to emergency rooms across the US caused by spice have risen <a href=\"http://www.aapcc.org/alerts/synthetic-cannabinoids/\">from 13 in 2009 to 1,500 this April alone</a>.</p> <p>“People are quite naive about it,” Shapiro said. “When they sprinkle it in a joint, they put the same amount in as if it were cannabis. That’s way over the top.”</p> <p>Some cities have taken a unilateral approach to combating the problem. Earlier this year, Lincoln became the first city in the UK to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/24/lincoln-to-ban-public-consumption-of-legal-highs\">ban the use of legal highs</a>. But prohibition is unlikely to deter homeless users. Gavaghan suggested that many use the drug as a coping mechanism to escape childhood trauma or other deep-rooted issues. Often, she said, homelessness and drug dependence feed off each other. “Substance misuse gets worse if someone is homeless. But some find themselves homeless as a result of substance abuse.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People on it, they're not there any more. They can walk around but their face is flat, they're not really hearing</p> <footer> <cite>Helen Gavaghan, counsellor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A significant factor is the prevalence of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/17/warning-over-legal-highs-in-jails-after-emergencies-at-bristol-prison\">drug in prisons</a>. As spice does not show up in tests, it has become the drug of choice for many inmates who continue using when they leave prison and are still being tested to comply with their probation terms.</p> <p>“These substances are cheap, legally available and potent,” said Jeremy Sare, formerly head of drug legislation and classification at the Home Office, now director of government affairs at the <a href=\"http://www.angelusfoundation.org.uk/\">Angelus Foundation</a>, a charity set up to campaign against legal highs. He is deeply critical of the way head shops sell the drugs, many of which are labelled “not for human consumption”.</p> <p>“They accept electrical items [in exchange]; they give credit; they’ll just sell you £2 worth – it’s all feeding addiction. Some operate 24 hours; they have a panel on which you can knock and someone will be there. The head shops are portrayed by some as benign, misunderstood chaps who are not really causing any social problems, just selling low-strength stimulants, but they are reckless in the extreme and are massively exploiting these vulnerable people and causing severe harm.”</p> <p>The government has pledged to tackle the problem. From April next year it will be a criminal offence to supply and import psychoactive substances, with offenders facing prison sentences of up to seven years. But <a href=\"http://www.homeless.org.uk/\">Homeless Link</a>, whose 500 member organisations have become so concerned about legal highs that they have established a forum to gather evidence on their effects, questions whether this will make much difference to those living on the streets.</p> <p>“The main source of sale will be transferred from shops to street dealers, where vulnerable people are at most risk of exploitation, abuse and violence,” a spokesman said. “And if, to reduce the risk of harm, vulnerable people then choose to buy through the internet, they are at risk of criminalisation under the proposed bill changes through the importing of drugs.”</p> <p>There are signs that the market is anticipating the effect prohibition will have on imports. Domestically produced synthetic cannabis, sold in unbranded packs, is starting to make an appearance on Britain’s streets. “There is a lot more homemade product around,” Sare said. “The manufacturing is pretty haphazard.”</p> <p>Several charities told the<em> Observer</em> that the manufacturers have begun to test their products by using homeless people as guinea pigs.</p> <p>Britain’s problems with the spice trade are just beginning.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10957488","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403099","internalRevision":"195","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Use of the synthetic cannabinoid is soaring in Blackpool, but the town is far from alone","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Plague of cheap ‘spice’ strengthens its grip on homeless and jobless in northern towns","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Jamie Doward","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T11:30:24Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2c6b026eac1c47fe82ba8b5c63b5fc0b444dba1/0_359_4635_2782/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2bt","wordcount":"1150","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d2c6b026eac1c47fe82ba8b5c63b5fc0b444dba1/0_359_4635_2782/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563d15ede4b09da63347fc82","newspaperPageNumber":"14","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T11:30:24Z","standfirst":"<p>Use of the synthetic cannabinoid is soaring in Blackpool, but the town is far from alone</p>","linkText":"Plague of cheap ‘spice’ strengthens its grip on homeless and jobless in northern towns","creationDate":"2015-11-06T21:04:45Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-08T15:28:43Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458350893"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/07/cheap-spice-strengthens-grip-northern-towns-blackpool-synthetic-cannabinoid","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/nov/07/cheap-spice-strengthens-grip-northern-towns-blackpool-synthetic-cannabinoid","sectionName":"Society","elements":[{"id":"d2c6b026eac1c47fe82ba8b5c63b5fc0b444dba1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d2c6b026eac1c47fe82ba8b5c63b5fc0b444dba1/0_359_4635_2782/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© gary telford / Alamy Stock Photo","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/d2c6b026eac1c47fe82ba8b5c63b5fc0b444dba1","suppliersReference":"F4KWAJ","altText":"Blackpool beach.","caption":"Blackpool beach.

Here’s Max Hastings, chuntering away in the <em>Mail</em> on “state snooping and why I trust our spies more than apologists for treachery”. And here’s contemporaneous <em>Mail</em> comment on “<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3298705/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-duplicity-Tony-Blair-cronies.html\">The duplicity of Tony Blair and his cronies</a>”: cronies like the senior spies who signed off on the dodgy Iraq dossier.</p> <p>Either spying and secrecy are part of the problem of transparency and trustworthiness, or they’re not. Either Snowden played his part and ignited the issue, or it somehow self-ignited. Either you trust the latest reassurances from on high, or you don’t.</p> <p>■ Mrs Merkel seems to offer Turkey a fast track to EU membership. And the EU commission, as represented by its enlargement supremo, the Austrian Johannes Hahn? He tells a conference that “media freedom is an essential pillar for our kind of society. It makes countries stronger … It goes hand in hand … with the rule of law and economic governance”. Are you listening, Turkey, because Mr Hahn was talking about you? (And, less buoyantly, once you’re in – like Hungary – will Brussels ever bother you again?)</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10955238","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402899","internalRevision":"57","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Media pressure has succeeded in moving Theresa May’s position on surveillance.

the wake of the Russian passenger plane crash, said senior industry experts, amid fears that flight safety is being compromised at many international airports.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> has learned that Egyptian airport and security officials have launched an investigation into all staff at Sharm el-Sheikh airport who came into contact with the Russian plane, which crashed 23 minutes after takeoff, killing all 224 people on board. The move has increased speculation that a bomb may have been smuggled on to the aircraft.</p> <p>In the wake of the disaster, aviation experts said a new international framework was needed to prevent airport security weaknesses being exploited by terrorists. They said urgent changes were needed to upgrade security checks made on airport staff before they reached “airside”, as well as a thorough raising of the vetting and recruitment process of airport workers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/sinai-magnet-for-terror\">How Sinai became a magnet for terror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Matthew Finn, who last month chaired the international world aviation security conference in Dublin, said that the issue of workers such as baggage handlers reaching airside without being screened or subjected to adequate security checks had to be addressed following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/putin-suspends-russian-flights-to-egypt-after-sinai-plane-crash\">apparent explosion</a> that downed flight 9268.</p> <p>“There needs to be an international response in terms of how everybody working in the aviation environment is vetted,” said Finn, managing director of independent aviation security consultants Augmentiq.</p> <p>“We need to ensure people who come into contact with aircraft in secure areas are the right people and that we are recruiting the right people for those jobs. There needs to be an international framework about how everyone working in the airport is screened and by whom.”</p> <p>Global security expert Philip Baum, editor of <em>Aviation Security International</em> – who chaired a session during the recent Dublin conference examining possible threats from airport “insiders” – said security needed to become both more unpredictable and thorough to confound future terrorism attempts.</p> <p>The current international approach was, said Baum, fundamentally flawed because it was too focused on producing minimum standards that even lax airports could comply with.</p> <p>“There would be much better security if you had no idea what type of screening process you were going to go through,” he said. “One person went through advanced imaging technology, one was going to be swabbed, one was going to be frisked – from a terrorist’s point of view that’s a nightmare, and why don’t we do the same with airport employees?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to move away from security theatre into security reality</p> <footer> <cite>Security expert</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“Until we address those inherent failures we are always going to have something that on the surface looks good, where passengers can say ‘Security was really good because they took my bottle of water away’, which is meaningless in 2015. We need to move away from security theatre into security reality.”</p> <p>Officials in Sharm el-Sheikh have disclosed that they are checking the airport’s security camera footage for evidence of suspicious activity prior to last week’s Metrojet flight.</p> <p>It also emerged on Saturday that the examination of CCTV footage of baggage handling by British aviation experts last Wednesday afternoon revealed evidence of flaws in the screening process that led to the grounding of UK flights.</p> <p>“We want to determine if, for instance, anyone sneaked past security officials or the metal detectors,” said another Egyptian official. “We are also trying to determine if there was any unusual activity among policemen or airport staff.”</p> <p>The latest moves follow claims in the French media that the sound of an apparent explosion can be heard on the flight recorder of the Russian-operated plane that came down over the Sinai peninsula.</p> <p>In recent days, the airport has been visited by senior Egyptian military and intelligence officials, while British officials have also been active behind the scenes helping to supervise tightened security measures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/egypt-plane-crash-tourists-can-stay-clear-unlike-those-living-with-terror\">Tourists can stay clear, unlike those living with terror | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to officials, investigators have started questioning staff and have begun surveillance on those who worked on the Russian flight. The widening hunt for a potential bomber follows reports that the airport’s director had also been called to Cairo to be interviewed by officials.</p> <p>The comments came as the focus of suspicion in the downing of the jet has increasingly homed in on both the airport’s luggage-handling arrangements and those involved in it.</p> <p>There have been reports that security agencies received intelligence based on intercepted communications between Sinai militants, which pointed towards a bomb on the plane.</p> <p>They apparently suspect an explosive device could have been placed inside or on top of luggage by someone with access to the hold just before takeoff.</p> <p>Amid visibly increased security around the airport, the resort’s hotels, bars, restaurants and popular areas of the city have been under greater scrutiny, with Egyptian secret police checking IDs and bags, using dogs trained to sniff out explosives.</p> <p>Denmark, Norway and Finland became the latest countries to tell their citizens to avoid nonessential travel to Sharm el-Sheikh.

There are some 79,000 Russians in Egypt, with about 20,000 Britons holidaying there at the start of the crisis.</p> <p>The sheer numbers involved, and a backlog of UK flights to the resort after they were delayed, has meant that some British tourists have been left facing delays of several days before being flown home, a situation which led to chaotic scenes at the airport on

Illustration: David Simonds for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>More than four decades have passed since strikers at Ford’s Dagenham plant helped usher in the Equal Pay Act. Yet, tomorrow, with eight weeks still to go until the end of the year, women in effect stop earning relative to their male counterparts. The point in the year campaigners have dubbed “equal pay day” is based on the 14.2% gap in average hourly pay between men and women working full-time.</p> <p>That gap is part of a much wider inequality problem in Britain’s workplaces. Not only are women likely to earn tens of thousands of pounds less than male colleagues over a career, they will also face a tougher battle getting to the top. They are far more likely than men to work in low-paid part-time jobs. And when caring needs hit a family – be it for small children or ageing parents – women are still more likely than their male partners to cut their hours or give up work altogether to shoulder the load.</p> <p>Good news, then, that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-my-one-nation-government-will-close-the-gender-pay-gap\" title=\"\">David Cameron has vowed to “end the gender pay gap in a generation”</a>. Shortly after re-election he announced new rules forcing every company with more than 250 employees to publish the difference between the average pay of its male and female employees. There were also encouraging noises in two government-backed reports published over the last fortnight.</p> <p>The most recent looked at the UK’s financial sector, where fewer women progress to senior levels than in any other industry. Leading the government-backed review, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/04/city-executive-bonuses-tied-gender-balance-targets-women-finance-report\" title=\"\">recommended the bonuses of City executives be linked to hitting targets for the number of senior women appointed at a firm</a>.</p> <p>That followed a report from Lord Mervyn Davies that showed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/29/a-third-of-boardroom-positions-should-be-held-by-women-uk-firms-told\" title=\"\">FTSE 100 companies had exceeded the target of having 25% women on their boards</a> – more than doubling their numbers from 2011, when the goal was set.</p> <p>Davies has now raised the bar, urging Britain’s biggest companies to ensure that at least a third of board positions are held by women by the end of the decade. So he should. The rise in numbers of women on boards is welcome but started from a low base. Research by the <em>Guardian</em> this year showed there were more men called John running FTSE 100 companies than all the female bosses combined.</p> <p>There are plenty of other reasons campaigners will be pushing Cameron and colleagues to keep their word on equality. When and if women do make it to the top, against the odds, they tend to be paid far less than their male peers.</p> <p>New analysis being published by the TUC tomorrow will show that as people move up the pay scale, the gap between men and women widens.</p> <p>There is still widespread evidence, too, of pregnant women and new mothers being discriminated against by their employers.</p> <p>Employers are by no means alone in carrying the blame for entrenched stereotypes around the role of mothers. Parents themselves are guilty of outmoded thinking when it comes to deciding who cuts their work commitments to care for the children.</p> <p>In theory, shared parental leave, which came into force this year, should challenge the stereotype of the mother as the main carer. But in reality for most families it would not make financial sense to take advantage of the new rules.</p> <p>It’s baby steps rather than social revolution. So will a generation be long enough? For the economy it simply has to be. More than half our graduates are women, and a country with such woeful productivity levels cannot afford to squander so much talent, training and education.</p> <p>But it will require more than reports and recommendations. Investors must lobby for more equality in companies, businesses themselves can fight discrimination, offer more flexibility and be transparent about pay. The government, meanwhile, must do more on childcare and to help fathers take parental leave.</p> <p>Only if action is taken on all fronts can we expect to stop marking equal pay day.</p> <h2>Insular VW badly needs some independents</h2> <p>The news last week that Volkswagen may have rigged carbon dioxide tests as well as those for diesel emissions is a disaster for the German company for two reasons. First, rigging CO<sub>2</sub> tests resonates more with governments and motorists than the diesel scandal. CO<sub>2</sub> effects the tax band that a vehicle sits in and its fuel consumption, so governments will be able to force the company to repay tax credits, and customers will ask for compensation for their fuel costs. Second, the discovery of another front in the scandal erodes the credibility of VW’s investigation, its management, and the company’s corporate governance.</p> <p>Matthias Müller, the new chief executive, was already stretching his credibility when he claimed that a handful of rogue engineers were behind the installation of defeat device software into 11m diesel cars. Now that we know VW may also have cheated other tests, this statement becomes even more unacceptable.</p> <p>Even if it was 10 to 20 rogue engineers who created the scandal, there is something deeply wrong in a company where this level of deception is allowed to foster or is not spotted. VW’s statement revealing its concerns about the CO<sub>2 </sub>levels emitted by 800,000 cars was laughable. It had no detail about the models involved or how the irregularities occurred. It provided more questions than answers.</p> <p>The German carmaker sorely needs an independent and experienced voice at the top to help it through this crisis. The bosses of Britain’s leading companies are criticised when they go awry, and rightly so. But the standards that FTSE 100 companies are held to should be applauded. The need for an independent chairman, a senior independent director, and the regular refreshing of boards means management is held to account and is connected with the outside world. VW gives the impression that it is insular. Its board is full of local government ministers and members of the Piëch and Porsche family. The works council is represented, while the chairman is the former finance director.</p> <p>The company should take a leaf out of Britain’s book and bring some outsiders on to its board.</p> <h2>Cyber-attack puts TalkTalk’s targets out of reach</h2> <p>Is embattled TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding about to set a record for the fastest abandonment of a core financial target? It was only in May that she upgraded the phone firm’s revenue targets. The last quarter had seen record growth and she thought TalkTalk could run at 5% every year to 2017 and beyond. After the cyber-attack suffered by the company a fortnight ago, few in the City think it can be done.</p> <p>On Friday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/06/nearly-157000-had-data-breached-in-talktalk-cyber-attack\" title=\"\">the group said the impact was “less than feared”</a> but the damage to the brand will be hard to shake off. Indeed, think of Harding’s reign as a five-year attempt to shed TalkTalk’s reputation for poor customer service. Until the hack, she seemed to be winning; hard to say so now.</p> <p>Chairman and founder Sir Charles Dunstone’s thoughts would be good to know: since the optimism in May, the value of his 30% stake has fallen by £450m.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10953314","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403080","internalRevision":"98","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Action on all fronts is needed if we are to stop squandering the talents of half the population","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"We can’t afford to squander the talents of half the UK.

Van Vliet protested “in the strongest possible terms” that Fisher had encouraged people to back Green candidates before the 2010 general election. The Greens’ Caroline Lucas went on to take the Brighton Pavilion seat from Labour with a majority of just 1,252 votes.</p> <p>Van Vliet told McNicol he found it “unacceptable that Mr Fisher is now allowed to remain a party member” because he urged people to consider supporting parties other than Labour.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.socialistalliance.org.uk/page.php?linkid=2&amp;sublinkid=56\">A record of a meeting</a> of the Socialist Alliance organisation in June 2009 notes how it heard “a personal statement from Andrew Fisher of the LRC [Labour Representation Committee] that any left platform should also consider endorsing socialist Green candidates and socialist Labour party candidates”.</p> <p>After Benn’s complaint, Fisher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/29/jeremy-corbyns-head-of-policy-apologises-for-tweets-against-labour-candidates\">apologised</a> for putting out a tweet in August 2014 which said: “FFS if you live in Croydon South, vote with dignity, vote @campaignbeard.” @Campaignbeard was the Class War candidate’s Twitter account. Fisher maintained that the tweet was a joke and did not indicate his support for Class War at the time, a line since backed in public by Corbyn’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell.</p> <p>Labour’s rule book says that anyone who supports a candidate standing against the official Labour candidate “shall automatically be ineligible to be or remain a party member”.</p> <p>As the row divided party moderates from leftwingers around the leader, who are determined to protect Fisher, Labour MP John Woodcock, former chair of the Blairite Progress group, warned Corbyn not to let the dispute become a “battle of wills”. “It is just not acceptable to employ someone, paying them through the fees of Labour members, who celebrates when respected longstanding MPs such as Ed Balls lose their seats. The situation is beyond ridiculous”.</p> <p>A former chair of the parliamentary Labour party, Lord Soley, said Corbyn was playing into the hands of the Tories by championing Fisher, who has used Twitter to criticise leading figures in Ed Miliband’s team. Soley told the BBC’s <em>Today</em> programme: “We don’t want people who have been slagging off Labour candidates and telling them not to vote Labour. We are betraying the very people who voted Labour in the hope they would get a Labour government. Going on like this, we will continue to keep the Conservatives in power.</p> <p>“This is very similar to the position the Tories got themselves into when they had Iain Duncan Smith as leader, and we actually did all we could to keep him there. The Tories are doing exactly the same with Jeremy now.”</p> <p>Former London mayor Ken Livingstone dismissed complaints against Fisher as a “complete nonsense”. “The people driving this are trying to undermine the leader who has just been elected, and that’s completely unacceptable,” he said. “If you are one of those New Labour MPs who thinks the Blair government was the apex of human civilisation, you have got to come to terms with the fact that the party has moved on.”</p> <p>A senior Labour figure, a member of its national executive , told the <em>Observer</em> Fisher should be subject to the same rules as everyone else in the party. “The problem is that the rule book does not cover the leader’s office. So someone can, technically, be suspended or even expelled from the party and there is nothing to stop them working for the leader.”</p> <p>The NEC, including its rules subcommittee, is expected to debate, within the next few days, whether to expel Fisher.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959547","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403253","internalRevision":"55","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Labour row escalates after leaked letter claims party leader’s policy adviser backed Green party candidates","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Corbyn adviser Andrew Fisher faces new claim of disloyalty","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Toby Helm and Daniel Boffey","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T20:36:27Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446928492463/Labour-leader-Jeremy-Corb-001.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2ha","wordcount":"745","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446928492463/Labour-leader-Jeremy-Corb-001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563e2feee4b09da63347fddf","newspaperPageNumber":"6","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T20:36:27Z","standfirst":"<p>Labour row escalates after leaked letter claims party leader’s policy adviser backed Green party candidates</p>","linkText":"Corbyn adviser Andrew Fisher faces new claim of disloyalty","creationDate":"2015-11-07T17:07:58Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-08T12:31:54Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458352227"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/andrew-fisher-jeremy-corbyn-labour-row-escalates","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/nov/07/andrew-fisher-jeremy-corbyn-labour-row-escalates","sectionName":"Politics","elements":[{"id":"16392be132760694c0fd4c8f1172ebb7796c40d8","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446928500508/Labour-leader-Jeremy-Corb-005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Getty Images Europe","picdarUrn":"GD*57444333","suppliersReference":"495677900","altText":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he still had 'full confidence' in his adviser Andrew Fisher, despit","caption":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he still had ‘full confidence’ in his adviser Andrew Fisher, despite his suspension from the party.

Since then, religious extremists here have often targeted intellectuals; however, it is clear from the most recent attacks on foreigners, publishers, moderate preachers and policemen that they are now widening their scope.</p> <p>The drive to reverse our liberal ideals was institutionalised with the killing in 1975 of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh. His successor, the military dictator Ziaur Rahman (Zia), founder of the Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP), used religion to bolster his regime; he restored to politics the Jamaat-e-Islami, a party that had opposed the creation of the country and which had collaborated with the Pakistani army. The dictator who succeeded him in 1981 declared that Islam would be the state religion. Zia’s widow, Khaleda Zia, continued an electorally profitable liaison with Jamaat; and as prime minister in 2001 she welcomed war criminals into her cabinet.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/bangladesh-killings-islamic-militant-unrest-economic-progress\">Bangladesh killings stoke fear of more deadly militant unrest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the 1980s Bangladesh became more susceptible to fundamentalists, as Jamaat and other groups received an increasing amount of funds from the Middle East, and as we sent more workers abroad to the region. Lately, support in the form of funding, networks and training appears to be coming from other parts of the world as well, including possibly western cities such as London and Toronto.</p> <p>The late 1990s saw the onset of violent extremism against targets viewed as un-Islamic, and in the early 2000s Humayun Azad and Shamsur Rahman, two prominent poets, were attacked with knives for their alleged anti-Islamic views.</p> <p>BNP’s last term (2001-06) saw the rise of terrorist groups such as Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), which was behind the grenade attacks that killed leaders of the then opposition Awami League party.</p> <p>When one side in our two-party system plays the religion card it threatens our secular values. Since 2001, BNP’s abjuring of any allegiance to such an ideal has been devastating.</p> <p>Yet our culture of pluralism has so far provided the bulwark against intolerant ideologies: tellingly, in a nation that is 90% Muslim, Jamaat has consistently failed to raise its support above single digits. But culture can withstand only so much assault.</p> <p>The erosion of liberal values in the political sphere has been accompanied by compromises at social levels. The middle class, previously insulated from hardline sermons, is now saturated by these messages via satellite TV and social media. The intrusion of such sentiments at all levels has led to instances such as an imam in a mosque in the capital referring to Shia Muslims as apostates, or a national cricketer compelled to remove a photo of goddess Durga from his Facebook page after protests that he had offended Muslim sentiments.</p> <p>In a culture that has long prided itself on its pluralism, such incidents were once unthinkable; now they are greeted with apathy or fear: moderate Muslims are afraid to protest against hardliners, wary of being called un-Islamic themselves.</p> <p>Indeed, the whole of our society has shifted – not quite to a point of no return – but to a parlous state. Progressives have trusted “culture” to take care of them, without doing enough to take care of culture in turn.</p> <p>Since returning to power in 2009 the Awami League has bravely pursued an international war crimes tribunal focusing on the crimes perpetrated during the 1971 liberation war. Yet at the same time it has pursued a scorched-earth policy against BNP-Jamaat, leaving those parties with little stake in our country’s future. The rise in extremist violence is in part a result of that breakdown of political space. The trials too have angered and given a focus to disparate extremist groups. The Awami League appears shockingly unprepared for the predictable fallout of its hardline tactics.</p> <p>The League presents itself as a guardian of secular values, but that claim is wearing thin in the party’s meek response to the attacks blighting our country. The government’s failure to protect targets on public hitlists is bad enough. Its half-hearted pursuit of criminals after the event is worse. But its strategic failure shows most deeply after each terrible incident when some minister moans about the need not to offend “religious sentiment”. Having pushed things to breaking point, the Awami League cannot dodge responsibility by blaming the victim.</p> <p>The Awami League, which appears increasingly opportunistic in its putative defence of secularism, might have the moral satisfaction of knowing itself to be the ill-equipped firefighter, not the arsonist – but only for so long.

The OECD average is 2.4%, while the figure is 2.8% in the US and 2.9% in Germany. Only by restoring the science budget to the levels of the US and Germany the UK be prevented from losing competitiveness, the report is likely to warn.</p> <p>However, such a move would require a fairly substantial rise in the science budget. Most observers expect that the deep cuts to be imposed elsewhere mean the best that scientists can hope for is another freeze.</p> <p>That would be a disaster, said the physicist and science populariser Brian Cox. “If there is another flat cash settlement, realistically it is dire. That is not my opinion; it seems to be the unanimous opinion of the research councils,” Cox told MPs.</p> <p>“Certainly, in my area, it is an absolute disaster. I would be extremely pessimistic if that happened.”</p> <p>The budget is divided between research councils responsible for funding work in biotechnology, environmental studies, social policy, physics, astronomy and many other topics.</p> <p>Much of the work is among the best in the world and Britain has won more Nobel prizes than any other nation, with the exception of the US. As Blackwood told MPs last month: “We are a science superpower.”</p> <p>Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, said: “On 15 December, just after the spending review, Tim Peake, the UK’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/25/tim-peake-next-stop-mars\">first official astronaut</a>, will fly into space for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2015/nov/06/astronaut-school-tim-peake-trains-for-space-pictures\">six-month stint</a> on the International Space Station.</p> <p>Peake has been an enthusiastic ambassador for science and technology, working tirelessly with the UK Space Agency to take his message to UK schools and the public at large. But if the government does slash the science budget, how will this be received?”</p> <p>Acting director of Case Naomi Weir agreed, saying: “Calling on the chancellor to increase investment in science isn’t special pleading by scientists, but is in the best interests of Britain.</p> <p>“The spending review is this government’s opportunity to back warm words for science with real investment. Failing to do so would not only damage UK science, but be a missed opportunity to invest in the UK’s future.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959050","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403226","internalRevision":"195","publication":"The

The mistrust is very deep-seated. We see the global awareness of my father and Ogoniland, but that is little consolation to the communities still drinking water with 900 times the World Health Organisation accepted level of benzene.”</p> <p>The anniversary of the execution of Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders, following a military court ruling which allowed no appeal, will be marked in London and Nigeria by vigils and church services. </p> <p>Environment and human rights groups said the “judicial murder” of the Ogoni Nine marked the birth of a worldwide ecological justice movement in opposition to oil spills and human rights abuses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7032051a66e8f7753f11d745e1a1edfe62ba1943\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7032051a66e8f7753f11d745e1a1edfe62ba1943/68_71_1139_683/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The British artwork memorial to Ken Saro-Wiwa being held in Lagos.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Saro-Wiwa’s execution aroused international condemnation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“He was the start of a shift in the way the world understands oil,” said Nnimmo Bassey, director of Nigerian environment group the Health of Mother Earth Foundation and former chair of Friends of the Earth International. </p> <p>“By standing up to the Nigerian government and to Shell he inspired people around the world. There are now many more voices and networks of groups holding Shell and oil companies to account.”</p> <p>Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International UK’s head of advocacy, said: “Saro-Wiwa devoted his life to making the link between human rights and environmental struggle in the Niger delta. </p> <p>“Tragically, the communities he defended are still blighted by oil pollution because of the continued failure of Shell and the Nigerian government. The fact is that the oil spills have not stopped and Shell still has not cleaned up the damage.”<br /></p> <p>Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said the execution of Saro-Wiwa focused attention on the need for reform of the global energy industry. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/05/ken-saro-wiwa-memorial-art-bus-denied-entry-to-nigeria\">Ken Saro-Wiwa memorial art bus denied entry to Nigeria</a> </p> </aside>  <p> “I am profoundly bothered when I see unfair, oppressive, society-harming actions by the energy industry,” he said.</p> <p>“This goes back to 1995 when Saro-Wiwa was judicially murdered. I felt helpless. Now I do not. Back then it was impossible to envisage a different world. Back then, health, wealth and happiness were inextricably linked to fossil fuels and their attendant corrupt, corrosive centralisation of power. Now we know another way is possible.”</p> <p>When Saro-Wiwa wrote the Ogoni Bill of Rights in 1990 it was intended to be a statement of self-determination. </p> <p>But Nigerian activist Ken Henshaw said it has become a rallying call for indigenous movements around the world: “The spirit of the bill lives on as communities fight to make decisions about resource extraction on their lands to stop environmental destruction and respond to the climate emergency.”</p> <p>Shell responded by saying it was aiming to clean up the backlog of oil spill sites in Ogoniland. “Despite not producing oil and gas in Ogoniland since 1993, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria and its partners have been involved in a number of initiatives aimed at delivering a better future for this region.</p> <p>“These include working with the federal government, communities and civil society on accelerating implementation of the 2011 United Nations Environment report; a remediation programme aimed at cleaning up the backlog of spill sites in Ogoniland as quickly as possible; and working with local communities to prevent oil theft and sabotage, which continue to cause environmental damage.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959291","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403249","internalRevision":"226","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Twenty years after ‘judicial murder’, Nigeria’s Ogoni people highlight international storm over oil spillage pollution","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Protest threatened over memorial 20 years after Ken Saro-Wiwa execution","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"John Vidal","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T20:21:52Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/26e34b1efbdcf80dcaa41a8f4ea70916ba42d3eb/0_186_4732_2839/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2h6","wordcount":"792","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/26e34b1efbdcf80dcaa41a8f4ea70916ba42d3eb/0_186_4732_2839/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563e28ffe4b05e53c04d4ca8","newspaperPageNumber":"11","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T20:15:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Twenty years after ‘judicial murder’, Nigeria’s Ogoni people highlight international storm over oil spillage pollution</p>","linkText":"Protest threatened over memorial 20 years after Ken Saro-Wiwa execution","creationDate":"2015-11-07T16:38:23Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-07T22:10:04Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458352123"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/ken-saro-wiwa-ogoni-people-shell-anniversary-memorial-bus","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/07/ken-saro-wiwa-ogoni-people-shell-anniversary-memorial-bus","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"26e34b1efbdcf80dcaa41a8f4ea70916ba42d3eb","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/26e34b1efbdcf80dcaa41a8f4ea70916ba42d3eb/0_186_4732_2839/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2005 Rex Features.

Though it promises robot carers for an ageing population, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/05/robot-revolution-rise-machines-could-displace-third-of-uk-jobs\" title=\"\">it also forecasts huge numbers of jobs being wiped out</a>: up to 35% of all workers in the UK and 47% of those in the US, including white-collar jobs, seeing their livelihoods taken away by machines.</p> <p>Haven’t we heard all this before, though? From the luddites of the 19th century to print unions protesting in the 1980s about computers, there have always been people fearful about the march of mechanisation. And yet we keep on creating new job categories.</p> <p>However, there are still concerns that the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) – which is able to make logical inferences about its surroundings and experience – married to ever-improving robotics, will wipe away entire swaths of work and radically reshape society.</p> <p>“The poster child for automation is agriculture,” says Calum Chace, author of <em>Surviving AI</em> and the novel <em>Pandora’s Brain</em>. “In 1900, 40% of the US labour force worked in agriculture. By 1960, the figure was a few per cent. And yet people had jobs; the nature of the jobs had changed.</p> <p>“But then again, there were 21 million horses in the US in 1900. By 1960, there were just three million. The difference was that humans have cognitive skills – we could learn to do new things. But that might not always be the case as machines get smarter and smarter.”</p> <p>What if we’re the horses to AI’s humans? To those who don’t watch the industry closely, it’s hard to see how quickly the combination of robotics and artificial intelligence is advancing. Last week a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qah8oIzCwk\" title=\"\">released a video showing a tiny drone flying through a lightly forested area at 30mph</a>, avoiding the trees – all without a pilot, using only its onboard processors. Of course it can outrun a human-piloted one.</p> <p>MIT has also built a “robot cheetah” which can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luhn7TLfWU\" title=\"\">jump over obstacles of up to 40cm without help</a>. Add to that the standard progress of computing, where processing power doubles roughly every 18 months (or, equally, prices for capability halve), and you can see why people like Chace are getting worried.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qah8oIzCwk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qah8oIzCwk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Drone flies autonomously through a forested area</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But the incursion of AI into our daily life won’t begin with robot cheetahs. In fact, it began long ago; the edge is thin, but the wedge is long. Cooking systems with vision processors can decide whether burgers are properly cooked. Restaurants can give customers access to tablets with the menu and let people choose without needing service staff.</p> <p>Lawyers who used to slog through giant files for the “discovery” phase of a trial can turn it over to a computer. <a href=\"https://x.ai/about/\" title=\"\">An “intelligent assistant” called Amy</a> will, via email, set up meetings autonomously. Google announced last week that you can get <a href=\"http://gmailblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/computer-respond-to-this-email.html\" title=\"\">Gmail to write appropriate responses to incoming emails</a>. (You still have to act on your responses, of course.)</p> <p>Further afield, Foxconn, the Taiwanese company which assembles devices for Apple and others, <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/2890032/foxconn-expects-robots-to-take-over-more-factory-work.html\" title=\"\">aims to replace much of its workforce with automated systems</a>. The AP news agency gets news stories written automatically about sports and business <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9572975/automated-insights-wordsmith-natural-language\" title=\"\">by a system developed by Automated Insights</a>. The longer you look, the more you find computers displacing simple work. And the harder it becomes to find jobs for everyone.</p> <p>So how much impact will robotics and AI have on jobs, and on society? Carl Benedikt Frey, who with Michael Osborne in 2013 published the seminal paper <a href=\"http://www.futuretech.ox.ac.uk/future-employment-how-susceptible-are-jobs-computerisation-oms-working-paper-dr-carl-benedikt-frey-m\" title=\"\">The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?</a> – on which the BoA report draws heavily – says that he doesn’t like to be labelled a “doomsday predictor”.</p> <p>He points out that even while some jobs are replaced, new ones spring up that focus more on services and interaction with and between people. “The fastest-growing occupations in the past five years are all related to services,” he tells the <em>Observer</em>. “The two biggest are Zumba instructor and personal trainer.”</p> <p>Frey observes that technology is leading to a rarification of leading-edge employment, where fewer and fewer people have the necessary skills to work in the frontline of its advances. “In the 1980s, 8.2% of the US workforce were employed in new technologies introduced in that decade,” he notes. “By the 1990s, it was 4.2%. For the 2000s, our estimate is that it’s just 0.5%. That tells me that, on the one hand, the potential for automation is expanding – but also that technology doesn’t create that many new jobs now compared to the past.”</p> <p>This worries Chace. “There will be people who own the AI, and therefore own everything else,” he says. “Which means homo sapiens will be split into a handful of ‘gods’, and then the rest of us.</p> <p>“I think our best hope going forward is figuring out how to live in an economy of radical abundance, where machines do all the work, and we basically play.”</p> <p>Arguably, we might be part of the way there already; is a dance fitness programme like Zumba anything more than adult play? But, as Chace says, a workless lifestyle also means “you have to think about a universal income” – a basic, unconditional level of state support.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest problem is that there has been so little examination of the social effects of AI. Frey and Osborne are contributing to Oxford University’s programme on the future impacts of technology; at Cambridge, <em>Observer</em> columnist John Naughton and David Runciman are leading a project to map the social impacts of such change. But technology moves fast; it’s hard enough figuring out what happened in the past, let alone what the future will bring.</p> <p>But some jobs probably won’t be vulnerable. Does Frey, now 31, think that he will still have a job in 20 years’ time? There’s a brief laugh. “Yes.” Academia, at least, looks safe for now – at least in the view of the academics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"156bebd67ca02f648c6c7dee317cb3c3344cd19a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/156bebd67ca02f648c6c7dee317cb3c3344cd19a/0_0_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foxconn sign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smartphone manufacturer Foxconn is aiming to automate much of its production facility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pichi Chuang/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The danger of change is not destitution, but inequality</h2> <p>Productivity is the secret ingredient in economic growth. In the late 18th century, the cleric and scholar Thomas Malthus notoriously predicted that a rapidly rising human population would result in misery and starvation.</p> <p>But Malthus failed to anticipate the drastic technological changes - from the steam-powered loom to the combine harvester - that would allow the production of food and the other necessities of life to expand even more rapidly than the number of hungry mouths. The key to economic progress is this ability to do more with the same investment of capital and labour.</p> <p>The latest round of rapid innovation, driven by the advance of robots and AI, is likely to power continued improvements.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.voxeu.org/article/robots-productivity-and-jobs\" title=\"\">Recent research</a> led by Guy Michaels at the London School of Economics looked at detailed data across 14 industries and 17 countries over more than a decade, and found that the adoption of robots boosted productivity and wages without significantly undermining jobs.</p> <p>Robotisation has reduced the number of working hours needed to make things; but at the same time as workers have been laid off from production lines, new jobs have been created elsewhere, many of them more creative and less dirty. So far, fears of mass layoffs as the machines take over have proven almost as unfounded as those that have always accompanied other great technological leaps forward.</p> <p>There is an important caveat to this reassuring picture, however. The relatively low-skilled factory workers who have been displaced by robots are rarely the same people who land up as app developers or analysts, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/05/robot-revolution-rise-machines-could-displace-third-of-uk-jobs\" title=\"\">technological progress is already being blamed for exacerbating inequality</a>, a trend Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes may continue in future.</p> <p>So the rise of the machines may generate huge economic benefits; but unless it is carefully managed, those gains may be captured by shareholders and highly educated knowledge workers, exacerbating inequality and leaving some groups out in the cold.<strong> Heather Stewart</strong></p>","internalOctopusCode":"10954512","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402726","internalRevision":"112","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"A new report suggests that the marriage of AI and robotics could replace so many jobs that the era of mass employment could come to an end","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Artificial intelligence: ‘Homo sapiens will be split into a handful of gods and the rest of us’","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Charles Arthur","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T16:18:56Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/29d9dadbc1dfdb541f0ace3639564e175d25abb9/0_382_5760_3457/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4exzn","wordcount":"1358","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/29d9dadbc1dfdb541f0ace3639564e175d25abb9/0_382_5760_3457/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563ca3a8e4b0cfe9766d0697","newspaperPageNumber":"42","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T16:18:56Z","standfirst":"A new report suggests that the marriage of AI and robotics could replace so many jobs that the era of mass employment could come to an end","linkText":"Artificial intelligence: ‘Homo sapiens will be split into a handful of gods and the rest of us’","creationDate":"2015-11-06T12:57:12Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-07T22:00:36Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458347407"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/07/artificial-intelligence-homo-sapiens-split-handful-gods","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/nov/07/artificial-intelligence-homo-sapiens-split-handful-gods","sectionName":"Business","elements":[{"id":"29d9dadbc1dfdb541f0ace3639564e175d25abb9","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/29d9dadbc1dfdb541f0ace3639564e175d25abb9/0_382_5760_3457/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

In this narrow rectangle of dishevelled shops, set back from a busy A-road, number 18 stands out. Just two weeks ago, it was an abandoned fruit and veg shop. Now, festooned in purple and yellow, it is the buzzing nerve centre of Ukip’s most concerted assault yet on traditional Labour territory.</p> <p>On Friday morning, the party’s deputy leader, Paul Nuttall, was holding court. He described <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/31/jeremy-corbyn-election-test-oldham-west\" title=\"\">the forthcoming Oldham West and Royton byelection on 3 December </a> as “a referendum on Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership” (although it is only two months old). With him was Paul Oakden, a shaven-headed, one-time floating voter from a family of Labour supporters. It was Oakden who masterminded the anti-EU party’s near-sensational result in the neighbouring seat of Heywood and Middleton last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/10/heywood-and-how-labour-nearly-lost-it\" title=\"\">when Ukip shrank Labour’s majority of 5,971 to just 617.</a> Oakden has carried over the same team from that contest, along with the same candidate, John Bickley. Oakden describes Corbyn as an “Islington chap” who does not “resonate round here”. Already helping him was an 80-year old retired heavy-goods driver, dressed in jacket and tie, and a 19-year old design supremo who would not look out of place drinking a craft beer in Islington North.</p> <p>Ostensibly, the odds of a Ukip victory here are long. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/21/veteran-labour-mp-michael-meacher-dies-aged-75\" title=\"\">Michael Meacher held the seat for Labour for 45 years</a>, beating Ukip into second by nearly 15,000 votes in May. Nationally, the party’s mood has deflated after the failure to win more than one seat at the election, despite a 12% share of the vote. But John, a 70-year-old retired office worker who didn’t want to give his surname, offers an insight into why Nigel Farage’s party is pouring in resources. John has always been Labour, but won’t vote for Corbyn. “I remember when we had to go to bed at seven because of the blackouts. There was no electricity. He wants to take us back to that.” Ukip is the only party he would now consider. Removing his thick glasses, he adds: “Enoch Powell had the right idea.”</p> <p>Once the biggest producer of cotton textiles in the world, Oldham’s fortunes declined steadily in the last century. In May 2001, tensions between whites and the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, who make up around 20% of its population, erupted into rioting. At the subsequent general election, BNP leader Nick Griffin stood in Oldham West and Royton and won over 6,000 votes – still the party’s second best-ever showing in a Westminster constituency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64a41d135531d8a1c82374b1c909037b6aa954c6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/64a41d135531d8a1c82374b1c909037b6aa954c6/0_66_4146_2488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ukip leader Nigel Farage meets students in Oldham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ukip leader Nigel Farage meets students in Oldham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Thompson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Labour wants to keep the campaign squarely on local and economic issues, particularly tax credits. On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/05/jim-mcmahon-labour-candidate-oldham-byelection\" title=\"\">it selected Jim McMahon, a truck-driver’s son who now leads Oldham council, </a>as its candidate. While his campaign will stress his local credentials, many in the town care about the bigger picture. Aisha, who also didn’t want to be identified, runs an eyebrow threading shop. She is undecided, though her daughter and full-time Corbyn fan will probably persuade her to vote Labour. Aisha’s father came to Oldham from Pakistan in the 1950s, when, she says pointedly, “there was a real labour shortage”.</p> <p>From Oldham Blue Coat school, you can just about make out, across the south Pennines, the cotton mills that once made the town wealthy. In Jason Casey’s A-level class there is a range of emerging political views. Some of the class are already old enough to vote. They are universally hostile towards Ukip. To one or two, the Tories seem the natural rulers. James Tierney is a Conservative supporter because “they can control the economy better” but he does not want to cast a “wasted vote”, so will probably vote Labour. Most are, however, eager to hear more from Corbyn, though Anna Worthington fears that her mother’s job in business would be at risk if he were to become prime minister, and Iwan Phillips, a Labour member who supported Andy Burnham, is conscious that “there are some people who will never, ever vote for Corbyn”. Nuala Scott is unswayed by their concerns: “He’s going to bring in more voters that are disillusioned, because Labour actually stand for something now.”</p> <p>In what will be Corbyn’s first big electoral test as leader, Labour’s challenge will be to try to maintain the momentum that put him in charge, while for Ukip it will be to play on voters’ fears about immigration, the EU, and the electability of the man from Islington.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959151","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403293","internalRevision":"141","publication":"The

</figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>A robot revolution could transform the way you manage your money within the next few decades – from instantly tailoring an investment portfolio to suit your circumstances, to sorting your tax affairs, debts and financial planning on your mobile device over breakfast.</p> <p>According to a report last week from analysts at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, artificial intelligence is set to take over a variety of jobs within 20 years, including financial advice.</p> <p>This new breed of so-called “robo-advisers” will not offer you a personal chat, complete with tea and biscuits. However, you also won’t pay through the nose for the service, enabling more people to afford the advice they desperately need.</p> <p>A consultation into how this type of financial advice could work more effectively for consumers was launched jointly by the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) last month. It includes a review of the role robo-advice could play in solving problems around accessing advice, with traditional providers often unable to cater for anyone apart from the very wealthy.</p> <p>Robo-advisers have been around for a while in the US. A report from Cerulli Associates last week said that robo-advice platforms are expected to reach $489bn (£323bn) in assets under management by 2020, up from $18.7bn today.</p> <p>Services are increasingly being launched in the UK too, targeting investors who need help with simple investment choices, but who can’t afford the often steep costs of face-to-face advice, which can swiftly amount to thousands of pounds. </p> <p>But if you’re expecting to be faced with a friendly machine such as C-3PO, prepare to be disappointed. Current robo-advisers are essentially online wealth management services which use algorithms to suggest automated investment portfolios based on customers’ goals and attitude to risk. Services in the UK include <a href=\"http://www.fiveraday.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fiver a Day</a>, <a href=\"https://www.moneyontoast.com/\" title=\"\">Money on Toast</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wealthhorizon.com/\" title=\"\">Wealth Horizon</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/dec/14/end-of-line-for-commission\">End of the line for commission</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ian McKenna, director at the <a href=\"http://www.ftrc.co/\" title=\"\">Finance &amp; Technology Research Centre</a>, says: “Many digital services are currently very much in their infancy, and the organisations offering them make it very clear that they are not a substitute for holistic financial planning. Using one of today’s digital advisers is a bit like going to the pharmacy and asking them for advice rather than going to see your GP.</p> <p>“Over time, this type of service is likely to become increasingly sophisticated. It should help democratise advice so that everyone who needs it can get it, and it isn’t unaffordable to the masses.”</p> <p>McKenna admits he dislikes the term robo-advice, while others claim it is likely to mislead consumers.</p> <p>Gina Miller, founder of online investment manager <a href=\"http://scmdirect.com/\" title=\"\">SCM Direct</a>, says: “It is often unclear where the boundaries lie between a personal recommendation and information/execution-only, and whether this is transparent enough for customers. I am astonished that more traditional advisers have not been up in arms about this.”</p> <p>Many online investment services are keen to distance themselves from the “robo-adviser” tag. Jason Hollands of online investment service <a href=\"http://www.tilneybestinvest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tilney Bestinvest</a> says: “‘Robo-advice’ has become a bit of a faddish term, and it isn’t how we would choose to describe our ready-made portfolios, as we’re not providing advice but a simple, step-by-step process to help investors select a managed portfolio without the need for an advised process.”</p> <p>Online investment manager <a href=\"http://www.nutmeg.com/\" title=\"\">Nutmeg</a>, which matches investors to portfolios depending on their goals and for how long and how much they want to invest, claims that what sets it apart from US robos is its active asset allocation approach.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Nick Hungerford, says: “You need to be strategic in how you take asset allocation decisions; it can’t just be ‘the computer says’.” The site charges an annual fee ranging from 0.3% up to 1% depending on how much you invest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was very honest but said because we had less than £100,000 it really wasn't worth either his time or ours</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lucy Watkins, 34, who is self-employed and works for the civil service, and her husband Tom, 35, a solicitor, invest £500 a month into a medium to high risk Isa portfolio through Nutmeg. Tom has also transferred his pension to Nutmeg.</p> <p>One of Tom’s work colleagues had recommended a financial adviser, but the couple were told that they didn’t have sufficient savings to proceed. Tom says: “I had a very interesting meeting with him and he worked hard, but he was very honest and said because we had less than £100,000 it wasn’t really worth either his time or ours for me to move my pension pot to them.</p> <p>“In the end we went with convenience and what seemed like reasonable fees. Nutmeg made it all very straightforward and their openness made me trust them. I was, however, nervous about their lack of track record. I am a bit worried by the fact that my pension pot has dropped fairly considerably since I’ve moved it to them, but I hope that’s reflective of the market as a whole.”</p> <h2><strong>Is robo</strong>-advice right for you?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"889ebf68bce534acfe0dbc3fc56bb2d0f58e40c3\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/6/1446814653903/2fef7ed1-c7b3-4bbd-b73a-29d05cd9dcac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"If your affairs are simple, a robo-adviser is a low-cost option.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If your affairs are simple, a robo-adviser is a low-cost option.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kacper Pempel/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If your financial affairs are simple and you are just looking for help on where, for example, to invest your Isa allowance, then a robo-adviser is a low-cost option.</p> <p>However, this type of service is not suitable for anyone with complex financial affairs who needs help with things such as trusts, estate planning or complicated retirement decisions.  </p> <p>Justin Modray of <a href=\"https://www.candidfinancialadvice.com/\" title=\"\">Candid Financial Advice</a> says: “These services focus their advice, or guidance, on deciding which of their investment portfolios suits the amount of risk you are comfortable taking. Don’t expect financial advice covering areas such as tax planning or reviewing existing investments and pensions.</p> <p>“That is not to say that such services aren’t worthwhile: the task of choosing and monitoring investments is at least taken off your hands. But if you are considering issues such as whether to transfer a pension, then robo-advisers currently fall short.”</p> <p>If you prefer face-to-face advice, you can find an independent financial adviser in your area through the financial advice trade body <a href=\"https://www.unbiased.co.uk/\" title=\"\">unbiased.co.uk</a>, or through the website <a href=\"http://vouchedfor.co.uk\" title=\"\">vouchedfor.co.uk</a>.

cheer last week amidst an otherwise bleak savings landscape, as challenger banks continue to battle for their cash.</p> <p>The Bank of England has indicated that interest rates are likely to remain at a record low until 2017, with savers shouldering the pain of dismal returns for another few years.</p> <p>However, there has been a flurry of activity from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/15/challenger-banks-how-they-compare\">challenger banks</a>, which may have a relatively small presence but are offering some of the best deals.</p> <p>Andrew Hagger from MoneyComms says: “There’s been an intense battle among ‘challenger brands’ in the fixed-rate savings market for months now, but the competition level has just been ratcheted up another notch with impressive new rates unveiled by Metro Bank.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2015/oct/10/ratesetter-funding-circle-zopa-interest-peer-p2p-lenders\">Internet peer-to-peer lenders offer savings rates that are peerless</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Metro, which launched in 2010, is offering an 18-month bond paying 2.4%, placing it at the top of the best-buy tables ahead of rivals Charter Savings and Shawbrook banks. Alternatively, there is a rate of 2.7% for savers willing to lock their cash away for three years, or 2.1% over a year. Elsewhere, Charter Savings Bank offers a one-year bond paying 2.07%, while Aldermore has a two-year bond paying 2.35%.</p> <p>For the first time Metro Bank is allowing online applications, which is good news for savers who don’t live near the branches, which are mostly in the south-east. The accounts all require a minimum deposit of £500.</p> <p>Sue Hannums, a director at Savingschampion.co.uk, says: “Savers may have suffered one of the worst periods in living memory in recent years, but things would have been a lot worse without the challengers.</p> <p>“Over recent months some rates for new savings accounts have hit a two-year high driven by challenger banks, while rates for existing savers continue to plummet. Better known savings providers are showing little to no interest in savers’ deposits, while most of the high street banks seem firmly focused on current account customers only.”</p> <p>The key players in the challenger bank market are Charter Savings, Shawbrook, Paragon, Secure Trust, Aldermore and Metro, Hagger says. More than 25,000 people have signed up for Charter Savings’ bank accounts since it opened for business in March, with total savings balances of more than £1bn.</p> <p>“All challenger banks offer the same <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/dec/17/fscs-savings-safety-net-raised\">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a> protection as the big high street players, so savers shouldn’t fear for the safety of their nest egg,” Hagger adds.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10952029","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402873","internalRevision":"30","publication":"The

Some are helping with university fees or deposits on a home, with about one in 20 handing over gifts of more than £10,000. More than a third said they gave cash as a “living inheritance”, with hopes of being around to see their grandchildren enjoy the money.</p> <p>The research indicates that due to the impact of rising living costs, many grandparents have stepped in financially. However, experts warn that grandparents risk compromising their own standard of living by being over generous: “It’s important that grandparents ensure they have enough money left for themselves,” says John Perks of LV=. “Even smaller outgoings like bills can become harder to meet later in life as the cost of living rises.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/01/equity-release-provide-for-old-age\">Is equity release a sensible way to provide for your old age?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/oct/18/osborne-new-pension-options-tax-implications\" title=\"\">New pension rules that came into effect in April</a> are expected to increase grandparents’ generosity.

On Monday, I fear parliament will play into their hands and vote to make it harder to defend a sensible framework of abortion law that gives women the healthcare they need.</p> <p>Nearly 50 years ago, the Abortion Act put an end to backstreet abortions – an end to the terrible deaths of desperate women and to the imprisonment of doctors who tried to help them, perhaps carrying out abortions for victims of abuse or rape or for women with serious health problems.</p> <p>Since then, there have been repeated attempts to change the law. Some people oppose abortion on principle – perhaps on faith grounds – and I respect those views, although I disagree with them. But each time, after serious debate, parliament has chosen to support the current framework, which set limits but treats abortion as a healthcare issue to be decided by women with their doctor.</p> <p>Without proper consultation or debate, parliament will vote on whether to break up that framework and devolve abortion law to the Scottish parliament. To do this without the serious consultation that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/27/scottish-devolution-smith-commission-key-points\" title=\"\">Smith commission</a> recommended is unwise. It could open the door to a new round of intensive, targeted pressure for restrictions both north and south of the border, and the fragmentation of important healthcare rights, which won’t be good for women in Scotland or England and Wales.</p> <p>The SNP government says women shouldn’t worry, because they have no plans to change the abortion law. I’m sure they don’t. But that’s not how it works. This amendment to devolve abortion to Scotland wasn’t put forward initially by the SNP or Conservative government – it was proposed by a small group of backbench MPs who publicly oppose abortion. And there’s a reason they did so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many American women now have to travel hundreds of miles to get a safe, legal abortion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Look what’s happened in the US. Anti-abortion campaigners, after failing for 40 years at federal level to overturn the Roe v Wade judgment on legal abortions, decided to target individual states one at a time instead. Their lobbying has been intense and targeted and many states have given in – more than 200 anti-abortion measures have been enacted across 30 states in the past three years. Many American women now have to travel hundreds of miles to get a safe, legal abortion.</p> <p>If abortion law is devolved to Scotland, it would be naive to think that anti-abortion campaigners won’t try to change the law or to test the commitment of the Scottish parliament over its new jurisdiction. That’s why they called for abortion to be devolved. At most, it will mean a new bout of lobbying that makes women feel uncomfortable about their choices and puts medical professionals under pressure. At the very least, it means different laws north and south of the border.</p> <p>Already, for historical reasons, we have a different framework for Northern Ireland – and each year hundreds of women travel across the sea for an abortion as a result. I don’t think we should fragment the system further and make more women travel when it would be better for them to make a personal decision with proper advice at home.</p> <p>Nor can we take for granted that aggressive, pressurising tactics of US campaign groups won’t ever be imported here. Already there are concerns that US-based groups such as <a href=\"https://40daysforlife.com/\" title=\"\">40 Days of Life</a> and <a href=\"http://abort67.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Abort67</a> have started to sponsor clinic protests here; I’ve heard appalling stories from patients and staff who have been abused, harassed, intimidated or filmed walking through the clinic door.</p> <p>Abortion politics is always sensitive. And there will always democratic debate about whether the framework is right. But let’s not be pressured into rapid changes without thinking through the consequences. At a minimum, MPs should follow the Smith commission and delay until there has been proper consultation with women and health professionals.</p> <p>For those of us who believe the current laws in England, Scotland and Wales are broadly right, surely we are stronger if we stand together to defend them against those who want to turn back the clock, rather than leaving each other to face the heat of the campaign alone.</p> <p><em>Yvette Cooper is Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract, Castleford &amp;

Carson’s favorability rating among Republicans, at 74%, towers over the field. His devout Christianity has made him a darling among evangelicals, who count for about a third of caucus participants in Iowa, the first state to vote. And in the last quarter the Carson campaign reported contributions of $20m, more than any of his rivals.</p> <p>Carson now faces a key test, with the Republican candidates convening on Tuesday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for their fourth presidential debate. Leading in the polls, Carson will be under new pressure to convince voters he belongs there.

It cut through that wooden cross, slowed it down a little, before it impacted my head, going through my brain.”<br /></p> <p>Johnson’s grandmother picked him up and started running, headed for the emergency room at Johns Hopkins hospital, two blocks away.</p> <p>“My head was gushing. My grandma was running me to the hospital.”</p> <p>Carson, who in some years performed more than 500 pediatric brain surgeries, received the patient. The bullet had not touched any of the lobes controlling speech or movement. Less than two days later, the boy was joking with doctors and could name all four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He became known as Little Miracle Man. Today, Johnson said, he suffers from occasional seizures, but otherwise has no residual impairments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ea5eb1c5d92b5da777a0b4c0df803bd7a96c6509\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ea5eb1c5d92b5da777a0b4c0df803bd7a96c6509/0_111_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quantae\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quantae Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom McCarthy for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson supports Carson’s presidential bid.</p> <p>“I believe he would put the right people in positions, who he perceives were good enough, and that would work out,” Johnson said. “He’s a very inspirational person to look up to.”</p> <p>Johnson said gun violence in Baltimore had only grown worse since he was shot in the head, and that the city needed more jobs. He said that his own access to medical care “could be better” and that he had stopped taking an anti-seizure medication because the side-effects interrupted his work as a home improvement contractor.</p> <p>But Johnson had faith in Carson’s ability to address the problems of hard-hit communities, he said, because that’s where Carson comes from. The surgeon’s mother, Sonya Carson, was one of 24 children who was forced into marriage as a teenager and who left her husband after discovering he had a second family. She raised Carson and a brother in poverty in Detroit and then in Boston, working multiple jobs and requiring her sons to read two books a week although she herself was nearly illiterate.</p> <p>“It seems we don’t have too many people who know about the adversity, and about coming from the bottom row, and seeing it all the way through, and having a vision of a better world, a better outcome,” Johnson said. “And I believe he has that in his mind.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0af67609287385d01cf0a1438f3786db46f3183c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0af67609287385d01cf0a1438f3786db46f3183c/0_59_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Carson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Carson with his wife Candy in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Sachs/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Sonya Carson worked hard to avoid what she considered the dangers of government assistance, she occasionally relied on food stamps and other programs to raise Ben and his older brother, Curtis. Carson’s subsequent opposition to welfare programs has left him open to accusations of insensitivity at least, or worse, hypocrisy.</p> <p>He rebuts the charge in his latest bestseller, A More Perfect Union. “Of course, the progressives will ignore the facts and claim that I am advocating eliminating all governmental safety nets,” he writes. “They will say now that I have ‘made it’, I want to pull up the ladder and keep others from benefiting. This kind of nonsense is typical of the scare tactics they use to maintain support for their failed policies …”</p> <p>Carson has called for more support of private charities, and runs a highly successful one, the <a href=\"http://carsonscholars.org/about-csf/our-impact/\">Carson Scholars Fund</a>, which started in 1996 and now awards more than 500 students annually with $1,000 in college tuition. The fund also finances the construction of “Ben Carson reading rooms” for children.</p> <p>What is indisputable is that Carson has, as he puts it, “made it”, having accrued a fortune from book sales, motivational speeches, positions on the boards of corporations including Kellogg’s and Costco.</p> <p>In 2001, Carson and his wife, Lacena “Candy” Carson, placed a substantial share of that wealth in real estate, buying a 48-acre property outside of Baltimore in rural Maryland, that <a href=\"http://www.baltimoremagazine.net/2009/2/1/dr.-ben-carson-tells-his-life-story\">boasted</a> Georgian décor, interior corinthian columns with gold-leaf capitals, a palace staircase, eight bedrooms and 12 bathrooms.

In Carson’s Maryland home, the “me-wall” was a “me-basement”, the walls covered with plaques. Upstairs, Carson’s Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, had pride of place near the front door. A painting of Carson in a surgeon’s coat hung over a mantle where a misspelled Bible verse was engraved. On another wall was a painting of Carson with Jesus Christ – his hand on Carson’s shoulder.</p> <p>Carson believes in God. But he also believes in himself. One of Carson’s defining moments as a brain surgeon was his decision to attempt a hemispherectomy, the removal of half the brain, to treat a child who suffered from hundreds of chronic seizures a day.</p> <p>It had been decades since the procedure had been attempted. The consensus of peers said it was dangerous and ineffective. Carson decided to investigate for himself, reading deeply and consulting with colleagues – and then he decided to try it. He rehabilitated the procedure, ultimately salvaging dozens of lives.</p> <p>Repeatedly in his career, Carson excelled by ignoring others’ advice about what was possible and what was impossible. He distrusted reputed “expertise” and found his own way, often brilliantly. So it is that when confronted on the campaign trail by an issue he hasn’t thought deeply about, such as one aspect of the US policy on Cuba, which <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/elections-2016/article42974889.html#storylink=cpy\">stumped him</a> last week, he does not register discomfort.</p> <p>“I have to admit that I don’t know a great deal about that,” he said, “and I don’t really like to comment until I’ve had a chance to study the issue from both sides.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08d252146d29d0ddf146b08277e8b598bc9c50d8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/08d252146d29d0ddf146b08277e8b598bc9c50d8/0_84_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Carson at debate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Carson alongside Donald Trump at the CNBC Republican presidential debate last month in Colorado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CNBC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Wednesday night inside the United in Christ Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) church, within walking distance of Johns Hopkins hospital Pastor Gary Adams and two church elders, Greg Manning and Parris Mitchell, sat talking about Ben Carson and the challenges that confront members of congregations like theirs.</p> <p>While the congregation has been shrinking in recent years, United in Christ is a linchpin for the community offering free food on Wednesday afternoons. That night’s prayer service drew only about a dozen worshippers, however.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"hymn united in christ\">  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/231839907&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>They heard a sermon about end times and the need to support those in prison, nursing homes and broken homes. They gave voice to their own prayers, asking God to work his will in a daughter’s troubled marriage and asking protection for “the children and grandbabies”. When the prayer meeting was through, everyone hugged everyone.</p> <p>“The Seventh Day Adventist church does not support or endorse any politician or political party,” said Mitchell afterward. “We don’t endorse anybody.”</p> <p>Carson had never visited the church, but he was well known, even beloved in the area, Adams said, for his work as a doctor and his charitable efforts. But the three men expressed reservations about Carson’s social views, and his hard line on social welfare programs.</p> <p>“[Carson] shouldn’t forget where he came from,” said Adams. “How he came up. He should have a better understanding about people’s struggles.”</p> <p>In Baltimore City, those struggles include excessive use of force by police, poverty, a lack of jobs, anger and frustration. Thirty-five percent of children in the county live in poverty, and the unemployment rate for black men ages 20-24 is 37%, according to the <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/24/24510.html\">latest US census data</a></p> <p>“I would say that 80 to 90% of the people we baptize into this church are poor people,” Adams said. “And we know that because we have a Lift the Burden fund, and people get into situations where they need financial help, so most of the people we baptize are poor people. And if they cut all of those programs out” – he shook his head – “Oh my goodness. My goodness.”</p> <p>The three men said the community needs opportunity, attention and help. </p> <p>“You hear it all the time, these individuals, they come in and they talk about, they’re going to ‘downsize the government’,” said Mitchell. “If you downsize the government, you cripple too many communities.”</p> <p>“As far as what Dr Carson has done with the Carson scholarships, and his medical profession, it’s admirable, his record speaks for itself,” Manning said. “That’s why people love him, that’s why people respect him. But as far as politics, I can’t really say that people follow him for his political views.”</p> <p>Adams summarized his view with a line in an email.</p> <p>“I am disturbed by some of his comments that he has made,” he wrote. “As a physician he was great. As a politician, I have no faith in his ability to run the country.”</p> <h2>Ben Carson’s CV at a glance</h2> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Benjamin Solomon “Ben” Carson</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 64.

Remember how he decreed, five years ago, that all his papers would have subscription walls because you couldn’t possibly give news away free. Well, cancel that last pronouncement (as well as his visionary belief that Apple iPads “may well be the saving of the newspaper industry” before his tablet Daily crashed and burned). There are no immutable rules in this free versus paid-for game.</p> <p>Tony Gallagher, the smart new editor at the <em>Bun</em>, is making its print form a tighter, newsier product. But does the fact that its unique user scores – around a tenth of those for Gallagher’s old outfit, the <em>Telegraph</em> – mean that the <em>Sun’s</em> fabled political clout has shrivelled? Does joining in some worldwide “conversation” bring governments to heel? Only if you think that the <em>Daily Mail’s</em> impact around Downing Street has increased exponentially because its now runs “the world’s biggest newspaper online” (as opposed to pursuing a parallel conversation keener on “ample cleavages” than a Dacre boot in some hapless bureaucrat’s ribs).</p> <p>Murdoch was inevitably right to build a wall around the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. (Thanks for the tip, <em>FT</em>). He may at least arguably be right to maintain one at the <em>Times</em> and <em>Sunday Times</em>. (Subscriber figures, good; digital global reach, zilch – though there are weird wobbles here in the restored realm of Rebekah). But downmarket – where you’re selling on tabloid pizzazz – the scene changes. Is the <em>Mail Online</em>, for all its phenomenal growth, coining profits in an ad-blocked era of mobile headaches? Will a successful celeb-and-just-fancy-that site morph into the new <em>Daily Mirror</em>? Don’t bank on it in this age of scrapped visions, black holes and advertising upheaval. The new, free digiBun probably won’t be a staging post to some roseate red-top existence; more an ad hoc reinforcement of the print presence in yet another vision of the future that may not endure beyond the day after tomorrow.</p> <p>■ One of the snags with “native advertising” (ie paid-for advertorial cooked up in-house or designated as an “independent publication by Upper Reach”) is that 18 pages of the stuff in the centre of the <em>Times</em> isn’t infinitely flexible when Cairo business push turns to Sinai airbus shove in the course of a Cobra meeting. The grounding of UK flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, leaving up to 20,000 panic-stricken Brits “stranded” in a sybaritic holiday paradise, is page 1 news. But turn far inside into the Upper Reaches of “Welcome President Sisi” to read how “Sweeping reforms have put Egypt back on the investment map”. ; how a “Resilient economy is gaining significant traction”; how “An ever steady banking sector looks to increase penetration”. And, of course, how “Red Sea resorts lead Egypt tourism revival”. You might call the whole thing “Stranded without a native second edition”.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10955235","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402879","internalRevision":"111","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Sun shows there are no hard and fast rules in free v paid-for game","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Sun’s paywall saga shows it’s never too late to change the rules","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Peter Preston","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T09:00:03Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3e5f3c4d576b8a86855b6fb31475564a1bed6d3/175_0_3105_1863/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e23e","wordcount":"492","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c3e5f3c4d576b8a86855b6fb31475564a1bed6d3/175_0_3105_1863/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563cca76e4b0fd5772b4d8bc","newspaperPageNumber":"45","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T09:00:03Z","standfirst":"Rupert Murdoch was right to build a wall around the Wall Street Journal and the Times.

It will mark the start of months of detailed negotiations involving senior representatives of all EU governments, ahead of the promised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/23/david-cameron-eu-speech-referendum\">in/out referendum on UK membership</a> before the end of 2017.</p> <p>In a speech on Tuesday, Cameron will use his strongest language to date to say that the status quo is not an acceptable option and that withdrawal may follow if the EU does not give substantial ground. Making clear that his, and his government’s, approach in the referendum campaign has not been predetermined, he will say: “If we can’t reach such an agreement, and if Britain’s concerns were to be met with a deaf ear, which I do not believe will happen, then we will have to think again about whether this European Union is right for us. As I have said before – I rule nothing out.”</p> <p>The tone of his comments will reassure some Eurosceptics, who feared he had privately accepted that he might not win in key areas of the negotiations, but would recommend to voters that the UK should remain in the EU nonetheless. Cameron will insist that he has “every confidence that we will achieve an agreement that works for Britain and works for our European partners. And if and when we do so, as I said three years ago, I will campaign to keep Britain inside a reformed European Union – campaign for it with all my heart and all my soul, because that will be unambiguously in our national interest.”</p> <p>His advisers have decided that, in order to push EU leaders to deliver a package that he can sell to voters as meaningful change, he must keep open the option of backing the “leave” campaign. The speech sets the stage for a series of tumultuous battles, particularly over restricting in-work benefits to EU migrants for four years, which many other EU nations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/07/europeans-warn-david-cameron-eu-exit-would-cost-britain-world-status\">led by Poland,</a> say would amount to a breach of the EU’s fundamental commitment to free movement of labour and discriminate against workers from other member nations. Downing Street insisted that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/04/david-cameron-water-down-welfare-limits-eu-migrants\">suggestions Cameron would drop or soften</a> the demand were untrue.</p> <p>In his letter, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/15/david-cameron-bows-to-eu-pressure-for-list-of-demands\">demanded by other European leaders </a>as a condition for beginning talks, Cameron is expected to spell out in general terms the four areas where he wants the EU to budge.</p> <p>These are: the four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work and other benefits; greater protections for non-eurozone countries to ensure they cannot be outvoted by eurozone countries; giving Britain an opt-out from the EU’s commitment to “ever-closer union”; and giving parliaments more powers to club together to block EU legislation.</p> <p>Senior government officials have indicated Cameron may think again about granting a vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, if, as is expected, the Lords backs the move in a vote on 18 November. The age group is regarded as more pro-EU than older voters.</p> <p>Senior sources say that, although the Commons recently voted against the move, Cameron and senior ministers are not ruling out softening their opposition if the vote in the Lords results in a large majority in favour. However, a Downing Street source said: “We are not going to get into speculating on what may or may not happen. We will cross that bridge when we come to it.”</p> <p>Labour believes Cameron may switch position because giving votes to 16- and 17-year-olds led to huge levels of engagement among young people in last year’s referendum on Scottish independence and because the EU vote will be binding. In Tuesday’s speech, Cameron will challenge both the Leave and Remain campaigns to clarify their arguments. “Those who believe we should stay in the EU at all costs need to explain why Britain should accept the status quo. I am clear that there are real problems with this.</p> <p>“There are some economic risks if we allow a situation where eurozone countries could potentially spend our money, or where European regulations hold back our ability to trade and create jobs. And there are also significant risks if we allow our sovereignty to be eroded by ever closer union, or sit by and do nothing about the unsustainable rate of migration into our country.</p> <p>“But just as those who are advocating staying in the EU at all costs have to answer serious questions, so those who think Britain should just leave now also need to think hard about the implications of their arguments.</p> <p>“What would being outside the European Union mean for our economic security? And what does it mean for our national security?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959745","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403260","internalRevision":"86","publication":"The

Syria after a senior Labour MP claimed most of his colleagues could defy their leader by supporting the deployment of British forces there, in the wake of the suspected terror attack on a Russian airliner over Egypt.</p> <p>As thousands of Britons waited to leave Sharm el-Sheikh on Saturday, John Woodcock, a member of Labour’s internal defence committee and MP for Barrow and Furness, said a decisive number of his colleagues could now be convinced about widening Britain’s military involvement into Syria if the government made the case. Jeremy Corbyn opposes any involvement.</p> <p>The defence secretary Michael Fallon claimed in the wake of the crash that killed all 224 passengers on the Airbus A321 on 31 October that it was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34742361\">“morally indefensible”</a> for Britain to rely on other countries to tackle Islamic State (Isis) when it was a direct threat to the UK’s national security.</p> <p>The UK is already among a coalition – including the US, France and Australia – fighting Isis militants in Iraq. It is understood that ministers have been privately discussing with both Labour MPs and sceptical Tory MPs what action in Syria might be approved by parliament.</p> <p>Woodcock said it was time for the prime minister to go public with a strategy in order to win support in the Commons and among the wider public.</p> <p>The MP, who is a founding member of the all-party Friends of Syria group of MPs, said: “I think Jeremy Corbyn’s and [shadow international development secretary] Diane Abbott’s views on this are probably set in stone and probably have been for the last 30 years.</p> <p>“But I think the majority of Labour MPs will feel, yes, the party whip is important, but that they have an individual responsibility as an MP, aside from party allegiance, to make what is the right, although always difficult, decision to consider putting UK forces potentially in harm’s way. I think the majority are open-minded, but they want to see a plan.”</p> <p>The number of Conservative MPs who would oppose intervention in a vote is likely to be in single figures, but Downing Street is yet to be convinced that there are enough opposition MPs to secure victory in a vote.</p> <p>The Labour MP’s comments suggest that the Tory rebels could now be more than outnumbered by the number of Corbyn’s MPs prepared to back the move, despite their leader’s opposition to it.</p> <p>Crispin Blunt, the Tory MP who chairs the foreign affairs select committee, dismissed Fallon’s comments but also said it was time for a strategy to be laid out for parliament to consider. </p> <p>He told the <em>Observer</em> the suspected terror <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/metrojet-ordered-suspend-all-flights-egypt-air-crash-russia-sinai\">attack on the Metrojet airliner</a> over the Sinai peninsula would usher in greater cooperation with Russia, but that the government had yet to provide a convincing rationale for British forces adding their weight to coalition attacks on Isis strongholds outside of Iraq.</p> <p>“We need a convincing comprehensive strategy. The moral imperative, as Michael Fallon describes it, to mobilise the entirety of eight RAF jets, doesn’t do the trick,” said Blunt. “We need to be clear: is this going to work and is it legal? If we can answer those questions satisfactorily, then go for it.”</p> <p>About 1,400 people were returned to the UK on Friday from Sharm el-Sheikh and another 1,500 were expected to leave on Saturday, but it is expected to take a further 10 days to repatriate all of the British tourists stranded at the Red Sea resort.</p> <p>A British government spokesman said: “With a limited number of flights able to leave Sharm el-Sheikh each day for the UK, it is likely that tour operators or airlines will advise some people to extend their stay at their resort.”</p> <p>Egypt’s civil aviation minister, Hossam Kamal, said the volume of luggage being left behind by British passengers had disrupted operations at the airport, and that a large number of scheduled flights had been cancelled. </p> <p>Of 29 services scheduled on Friday, 21 were cancelled by the Egyptian authorities and some planes were forced to divert in mid-flight.</p> <p>There are also an estimated 70,000 Russians at the resort and in Hurghada, on the other side of the Red Sea. </p> <p>The Russian deputy prime minister, Arkady Dvorkovich, said his country’s nationals would not be flocking to come home. “Tourists will be returning from Egypt to Russia when they planned to,” he said.</p> <p>The head of an investigation committee into the crash, Ayman al-Muqaddam, confirmed on Saturday reports that there was a noise at the end of a cockpit recording from the crashed Russian jet.</p> <p>Al-Muqaddam said experts were still gathering information and it was too soon to announce their conclusions. The British transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said information obtained by UK officials indicated that there was a “high probability” that the aircraft was brought down by an explosive device.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959376","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403259","internalRevision":"93","publication":"The

in the hills and valleys of the Basque country this autumn and are only now being cleared away, almost 80 years after the start of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/galleryguide/0,6191,395635,00.html\" title=\"to guardian conflict page\">the Spanish civil war</a>. But this time it was all make-believe.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/27/pressandpublishing.comment\" title=\"comment is free piece\">The life of George Steer,</a> the British reporter who brought the horror of the bombing of Guernica in 1937 to the public in both Britain and America, has inspired a major English-language film, due out next year. Called <em>Gernika</em>, using the Basque spelling, it will be the first to depict the terrible events of 26 April on the big screen and it has been welcomed by the people of the region, many of whom have taken part as extras.</p> <p>Steer’s reports for the <em>Times</em> and for the <em>New York Times</em> were famously inspirational in their own right. It was a French version of his account, carried in <em>l’Humanité</em>, that prompted Pablo Picasso to create the huge monochrome painting, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/19/guernica-75-symbol-art-triumph-over-war\" title=\"to Guardian appraisal of impact\"><em>Guernica</em>, as testament to the suffering of his countrymen.</a></p> <p>Filing his story the day after the notorious air attack, Steer wrote: “At 2am today when I visited the town the whole of it was a horrible sight, flaming from end to end. The reflection of the flames could be seen in the clouds of smoke above the mountains from 10 miles away. Throughout the night houses were falling until the streets became long heaps of red impenetrable debris.” Picasso began work on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/26/pablo-picasso-guernica-spain-war\" title=\"praise for the painting\">his great painting</a> four days later.</p> <p>Steer’s story will be at the centre of the film, shot this summer in the northern town, in nearby Bilbao and surrounding hills. The Winchester- and Oxford-educated journalist, renamed Henry, is played by British actor James D’Arcy, best known for his menacing role in the second series of the BBC television series <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/broadchurch\" title=\"\"><em>Broadchurch</em></a>. Fellow British actor Jack Davenport has also been cast in the film, a £4.2m joint Spanish and American production. The renowned Spanish actress María Valverde stars opposite them in a screenplay described as “a love story set against the infamous bombing”.</p> <p>The film is a personal project for the Basque director Koldo Serra, and much of the detail in it comes from historical testimonies he began collecting in 2012. He heard directly from elderly survivors how, after the attack, impoverished villagers combed the debris for the valuable aluminium casings of the bombs.</p> <p>The screenplay, an American and Spanish collaboration by three writers, revolves around the journalist’s encounter with a woman who works as an editor at the republicans’ press office on the northern front, as their forces try to hold back the nationalists under the general command of Francisco Franco.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4263d738a0bcb451f219f8160c463e70c6eac211\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4263d738a0bcb451f219f8160c463e70c6eac211/0_0_6567_3944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bomb damaged street in Guernica during the Spanish Civil War 1937\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bomb damaged street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“Henry will have character traits of George Steer, Ernest Hemingway and [the photographer] Robert Capa,” Serra has explained, defending his decision to make his hero an American, not a Brit. “And while there will be considerably large, dramatic war sequences, the story is, at heart, an intimate one. Hopefully, it feels like <em>Casablanca</em>.”</p> <p>Davenport plays a Soviet official advising the republicans. During the Spanish civil war, which raged until April 1939, nationalist rebels fought the republicans for control of Spain and, following an arrangement with Hitler’s Germany, German aircraft bombed the town of Guernica, a centre of Basque separatist thought and also the base for many republican fighters.</p> <p>Official nationalist reports said there had been about 300 deaths. The Basques said more than 1,500 civilians were killed in an air raid that lasted nearly four hours. The exact number is still in dispute today. As Steer wrote the next day: “Guernica was not a military objective. A factory producing war material lay outside the town and was untouched. So were two barracks some distance from the town. The town lay far behind the lines. The object of the bombardment was seemingly the demoralisation of the civil population and the destruction of the cradle of the Basque race. Every fact bears out this appreciation, beginning with the day when the deed was done.”</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/06/biography.features\" title=\"to review of biography\">The journalist, who was born in South Africa and who died in 1944 in Myanmar in a jeep crash,</a> had gone on to write a book about the events in Spain. Its title refers to the symbolic Basque oak in the centre of Guernica. “You must read a book by a man named Steer: it is called the <em>Tree of Gernika</em>,” wrote the famous war correspondent Martha Gellhorn to Eleanor Roosevelt, her friend and the then US president’s wife, in 1938.</p> <p>“It is about the fight of the Basques – he’s the London <em>Times</em> man – and no better book has come out of the war and he says well all the things I have tried to say to you the times I saw you, after Spain. It is beautifully written and true, and few books are like that, and fewer still that deal with war.”</p> <p>A street in Bilbao bears Steer’s name.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959250","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403230","internalRevision":"98","publication":"The

Customs (HMRC) every month to discuss their tax credits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/04/hmrc-poor-customer-service-hindering-tax-collection\">are abandoning calls in despair</a> because they are often kept waiting in queues for at least 15 minutes, according to official government figures.</p> <p>A shocking tally of unanswered and terminated calls is revealed in performance updates on HMRC’s website, which show that customer service teams dealing with queries cannot cope with the volume of inquiries.</p> <p>Critics of HMRC’s performance say that if the failings are so evident now, the system will be overwhelmed next spring, when billions of pounds of cuts to tax credits, planned by the chancellor, George Osborne, come into force.</p> <p>Latest HMRC data shows that in March this year staff dealt with just 68.3% of 1,433,235 calls about tax credits, compared with 98.3% of the 1,124,860 calls made on the same subject in March last year. Even more startling is that 277,799 of the calls this year were abandoned, compared with 12,250 in March 2014.</p> <p>In January this year, the average waiting time was 16 minutes and 49 seconds, compared with four minutes and four seconds in April last year.</p> <p>The average time before people abandoned a call in January this year was 13 minutes and 59 seconds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/04/hmrc-poor-customer-service-hindering-tax-collection\">HMRC's poor customer service hindering tax collection, say MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Concern among the public over how tax credit reductions will hit their budgets was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/16/david-cameron-spokesman-respond-question-time-tax-credits-complaint\">vividly demonstrated by a single mother</a> on BBC1’s Question Time last month.<br /></p> <p>Folliwng a humiliating defeat in the House of Lords, Osborne has been forced to think again about the levels <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/27/george-osborne-ready-to-bow-to-pressure-to-soften-tax-credit-cuts\">at which the cuts will be imposed</a> on the poorest families – but millions of families will still be hit by sharp falls in income.</p> <p>On Saturday, an HMRC spokesman admitted the department had fallen short of acceptable levels of customer service. </p> <p>He said: “We have recognised that our customer service has not been good enough, and have taken major steps to improve by recruiting 3,000 new staff … and introducing online services that give customers new ways to deal with HMRC at any time.</p> <p>“Of the 2.5 million people renewing tax credits this year, more than 750,000 did so online, and our new webchat service has helped more than 100,000 customers so far, with 86% satisfaction rates.”</p> <p>Government sources say that while some calls to HMRC would be free of charge, others would be chargeable. This would depend on on the service provider and whether the calls were made from a landline or a mobile.<br /></p> <p>Last week, the cross-party parliamentary public accounts committee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/04/hmrc-poor-customer-service-hindering-tax-collection\">issued a highly critical report</a> about performance throughout HMRC.

Anything short of this will be letting down the working people of Britain.”</p> <p>Labour says the number of people calling the helpline could more than double compared with April this year if all 3.3

Let’s think about how that delivery has worked successfully in financial returns, customer satisfaction, environmental policy and see if we can apply it to gender progress and diversity,” Gadhia said after the reception. “This is about women from the very beginning of their careers… This is about creating an environment where all women can become senior if that is want they want to do. I’m trying to have a level playing field for everybody.”</p> <p>The reasons she lists for the imbalance are well-known: motherhood, remuneration, the old boys’ network. But she deliberately avoided suggesting an industry-wide target, such as the one set by Lord (Mervyn) Davies to encourage firms to get more women in boardrooms. “Quotas and imposed targets could have all sorts of backlash,” she said. “We don’t say to organisations ‘you have to have a customer satisfaction score of x’.” Requiring companies to publish their goals should be the way to hold them to account, she suggested. She did not believe any job in financial services should be out of the reach of women.</p> <p>Much could be done to break down stereotypes. Advisers on mergers and acquisitions, for instance – a line of business notorious for long hours of negotiations – could change working practices. One idea would be for advisers to work round the clock on one deal for three months and take a break before starting on the next one. “If we can just get that sort of thought going,” she said.</p> <p>What about her own working hours? Gadhia said she didn’t keep track.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50ae2e939b0aefce3d373a8b282eab0bd8ffc14c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/50ae2e939b0aefce3d373a8b282eab0bd8ffc14c/0_59_4512_2709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gadhia during a panel discussion on women in finance at No 11 Downing Street last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gadhia during a panel discussion on women in finance at No 11 Downing Street last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I live one life. When people ask me how many hours I work, I don’t really know. Given the technology [available] today, I work all the time but I don’t feel absent from home. Do I have a work-life balance? I have a life that feels balanced and full and I don’t think any part of it feels underinvested-in.”</p> <p>Gadhia said she encourages women to take the maximum amount of maternity leave time that they can. She took only six weeks, which in retrospect was “stupid”. “I worry that because we want to make it the norm for women to work that it feels wrong to stay at home. It’s about giving men and women choices.”</p> <p>More thought also needs to be given to the transition back into work, she says, though she “never had that dislocation in coming back” from maternity leave. Her husband Ashok, whose surname she uses, gave up his job when they had their daughter Amy after 19 years of marriage and six courses of IVF. He was also at Downing Street to support her efforts to promote gender balance.</p> <p>At the event, City women were lining up and taking selfies of themselves in No 11; Gadhia appeared as starstruck as anyone. That would surprise many. Once an outsider – not just as a women but as the boss of a so-called challenger bank – Gadhia has become part of the establishment. At the Mansion House dinner in June she sat next to Osborne as he outlined his settlement with the City after five years of banker-bashing.</p> <p>She has had her setbacks. She failed in her first attempt to buy Northern Rock when it was on the brink of collapse in 2008. She had a second try and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/17/northern-rock-virgin-money-taxpayer\" title=\"\">won control of the sound part of the nationalised lender</a> three years later for Virgin Money, backed by Sir Richard Branson, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/13/virgin-money-float-85m-richard-branson\" title=\"\">which has since floated on the stock market</a>. She sold around a quarter of her stake for £2m.</p> <p>She went to Virgin after leaving RBS (where her problem was not with Fred Goodwin - now stripped of his knighthood - but others) before the 2008 crash. Referring back to a previous giant financial scandal, Gadhia recalls feeling at the time “this is going to be the next Enron.”</p> <p>A better gender balance might at least have helped in 2008, she feels.</p> <p>“If there had been more gender balance and diversity pre-crisis we would still have had a crisis, but I bet you it would have been less rocky, less bumpy and less painful.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10954679","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402993","internalRevision":"115","publication":"The

Many had come for the first time to witness the much-vaunted oratorical skills of France’s youngest MP – and to see how she compared to her grandfather, the gruff former paratrooper Jean-Marie Le Pen, who co-founded the Front National in 1972 and led it to become the most successful far-right party in western Europe.</p> <p>Maréchal-Le Pen, 25, the Front National’s biggest young star, is at the fore of a crucial new battle in the party’s grassroots rise across France. She is running to lead the southern region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur in regional elections next month. A historic win is within reach that would cement the party’s drive for local power and boost the presidential ambitions of her aunt and party leader, Marine Le Pen.</p> <p>For decades, the sun-soaked south of France was the heartland of “Grandpa” Le Pen, who built up an electoral base here in the early 1990s. That party powerbase has now mushroomed: when a record <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/19/front-national-secret-welcome-provincial-france-elections\">11 Front National mayors</a> were elected across France last year, five were in towns in this southern region. The Front National’s first two senators are both from the south. The vast Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region has five million people spreading from coastal cities such as Marseille up to Avignon in Vaucluse, taking in Riviera beach resorts and tiny mountain villages. It is one of the richest regions in France, with a vast budget that one local Front National figure pointed out was “bigger than the budgets of some European countries”.</p> <p>But although the Riviera is synonymous with the eye-watering wealth of figures such as the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who has a chateau near Antibes, the region also has a large disparity between rich and poor and isn’t immune to France’s historically high 11% unemployment rate and economic gloom. Maréchal-Le Pen is on a mission to court what she calls “the France of the forgotten”, running a hardline campaign on identity, immigration and security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7e11f4f3a1a46f66cae823896f94ea388b6acb39\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7e11f4f3a1a46f66cae823896f94ea388b6acb39/0_565_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christian Estrosi is Marion Marechal-Le Pen’s main rival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christian Estrosi is Marion Marechal-Le Pen’s main rival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Splash News/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Behind her campaign looms the shadow of her aunt, who is running to head the north-eastern region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie and use it as a springboard for her presidential ambitions in 2017. Marine Le Pen has led a public relations drive to “detoxify” the party and move it away from the racist, jackbooted, antisemitic imagery of the past. But its hardline positions on Islam and immigration remain unchanged. If Marine Le Pen and her niece, as polls predict, manage to win the first two French regions ever to be led by the FN, they hope it will draw a line under the bitter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/le-pen-feud-family-drama-in-battle-for-the-soul-of-front-national-and-france\">public family feud</a> that has led Marine Le Pen to push her father out of the party amid ongoing courtroom spats.</p> <p>However, the Riviera battle also provides a platform for the devoutly Catholic Maréchal-Le Pen to showcase how she is even more rightwing and socially conservative than her aunt.</p> <p>On stage, unlike her grandfather and aunt, famed for their tub-thumping speeches, Maréchal-Le Pen takes the mic off its stand and walks around like a friendly compere, talking in a soft voice and ripping apart her opponents with barbed jokes. She warned that France was under threat of being submerged by immigrants and radical Islam and disappearing completely, making bold references to the “great replacement” theory by the controversial writer, Renaud Camus, who has argued that local French populations will be replaced by newcomers who reproduce faster. “There’s a great replacement of populations at work, let’s be frank,” she said, adding that the most “terrifying symptom” of this was the arrival of refugees.</p> <p>She asked why fleeing Syrians had not stayed and fought. “In France, when there was a war we fought and our ancestors fought, though many had real reason to flee the Germans.” With an echo of her religious beliefs, she said she could bring France “a sublime resurrection”, to cheers and applause.</p> <p>Her election leaflets go far: she says she does not want a region that is “black-blanc-beur” – “black, white, Arab”, a term used to hail the multicultural French football team that won the World cup in 1998 – but instead wants a region that is “bleu-blanc-rouge”, the colours of the French flag. She has said she doesn’t want “the Riviera to turn into the favelas”, an allusion to Brazilian shanty towns.</p> <p>Among the candidates she had chosen to run with her as regional councillors are several hardline figures once kept at arm’s length from the party by her aunt, including Philippe Vardon, a former leader of the small Bloc Identitaire, which is even further to the right than the Front National.</p> <p>Denise Soler, a former shop assistant and ‘pied-noir’ – the name given to French people born in Algeria who returned to France after independence – said: “I’m not racist but people are worried by the number of Muslims arriving in France.”</p> <p>Isabelle Houssays, an insurance worker who joined the party last year, impressed by its new, “softer” image, said: “She’s a visionary who wants to save our country.”</p> <p>Hervé, a telecoms technician in his 50s who used to vote for the left, had come out of curiosity and because he agreed with her drive to allocate benefits for the French above immigrants. He went home saying: “She blew me away.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad387cf58a2eb724190d3c71bd0a4a18be97acfa\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ad387cf58a2eb724190d3c71bd0a4a18be97acfa/0_147_2300_1381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine and Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marion’s aunt and grandfather respectively.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marine and Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marion’s aunt and grandfather respectively.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Pratta/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Polls put Maréchal-Le Pen slightly ahead, but the battle is extremely close. It has become a deeply personal fight with her main opponent, the debonair MP and mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, from former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s right-wing Les Républicains party. Estrosi, a former motor bike champion and government minister, 60, is already seen as on the hard right of his party, increasing security measures in Nice and banning “youyous” or north African cries of joy from weddings at his town hall.</p> <p>Earlier this year he publicly complained of a “fifth column” of Islamists in France and a “world war three” against the country’s Christian roots. He has attacked Maréchal-Le Pen as “the most dangerous of the three Le Pens”, slamming her for her “extremism” and her cosseted upbringing at her grandfather’s posh manor estate outside Paris.</p> <p>With the left divided and trailing far behind, several surprising but key figures who would not normally vote right have backed Estrosi in a bid to keep out the FN. Serge Klarsfeld, the celebrated French lawyer and Nazi-hunter who was hidden from Nazis in Nice as a child during the occupation, has urged people to vote for Estrosi to block what he said was a “racist, xenophobic and antisemitic” party.</p> <p>Mourad Boudjellal, president of Toulon rugby club, also backed Estrosi against what he called Front National “blackshirts”. It remains to be seen whether the Socialists, expected to come third, will pull out of the second round to allow Estrosi a clear run against Maréchal-Le Pen. That question remains controversial on the left.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the local Front National grassroots were hailing the party’s progress. “Ten years ago our vote was a protest vote; now people adhere to our ideas as a real alternative,” said Lionel Tivoli, a young local councillor and IT technician who joined the party at 18. “I’m very far from being racist, but I don’t accept that people who come here don’t adapt to our customs and impose theirs.”</p> <p>At the Antibes rally, some who had never voted Front National said it might be a “necessary evil” to shake up French politics. Christian Noirel, who used to run a small public works company and until now had been sceptical of the Front National’s economic policy and drive to leave the euro, said: “France needs a strong opposition party that can wake other politicians up.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959565","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403269","internalRevision":"92","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, the youngest member of the political dynasty, is aiming to win a vital seat for the far-right party","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"France: can poster girl of Front National win victory in Riviera?","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Angelique Chrisafis","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T22:34:10Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446935558809/Front-National-candidate--001.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2hq","wordcount":"1392","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446935558809/Front-National-candidate--001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563e47d7e4b05e53c04d4ce2","newspaperPageNumber":"24","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T22:34:10Z","standfirst":"<p>Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, the youngest member of the political dynasty, is aiming to win a vital seat for the far-right party</p>","linkText":"France: can poster girl of Front National win victory in Riviera?","creationDate":"2015-11-07T18:49:59Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T11:36:42Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458352378"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/france-le-pen-front-national-cote-dazur","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/07/france-le-pen-front-national-cote-dazur","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"2c55a045ae7333ac03ee4cfa95dfed2a7fd05a76","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446935564793/Front-National-candidate--005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"AFP","picdarUrn":"GD*57102917","suppliersReference":"Par8311355","altText":"Front National candidate Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, with lawyer and National Assembly member Gilbert Co","caption":"Front National candidate Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, with lawyer and National Assembly member Gilbert Collard on the campaign trail in Arles.

But the more I listen to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the more I think this won’t happen.</p> <p>People will differ in their views on whether £23,000 is an appropriate basic starting salary for junior doctors. I am aware that we are not the only professionals to work hard, long hours. But I am unaware of other professions that are tasked with the sort of responsibilities thrust on junior doctors. By the age of 25, I had told people that they might die or that their relatives had died. I had been part of a team that treated three young men who had been shot. I had witnessed a child die suddenly and helped, unsuccessfully, to resuscitate her. I have known that, following an accident, a 30-year-old would be quadriplegic before he did and watched as he was told. These, Mr Hunt, are regular experiences for junior doctors.</p> <p>Yet, despite working conditions and a salary that is much more favourable in Australia and New Zealand, we are yet to see a mass exodus of junior doctors who are willing to stay in these countries for training. Therefore we can assume that, like me, most junior doctors consider the current contract conditions to be fair. </p> <p>However, Hunt has decided in recent months to insult my profession by trying to enforce an unsafe and unfair contract on junior doctors and by indulging in falsehoods such as blaming consultants and then junior doctors for 11,000 “excess deaths” at weekends. He has also had the audacity to use rhetoric suggesting that junior doctors are the barriers to providing 24/7 NHS care. A lack of funding is the barrier to a truly 24/7 service.</p> <p>Hunt’s most recent political game and ploy to grab headlines has been to offer a “last-minute 11% pay rise”, not in writing to our union (as one might expect), but to the media. In this, he fails to outline that he intends to classify Saturday as a normal working day and remove a large part of the on-call hours that are paid, quite rightly, at an increased rate. The result? Junior doctors working more antisocial hours for less money: not quite the 11% pay rise promised. It’s clearly an attempt to undermine the BMA and junior doctors’ negotiating position as he fears losing public opinion if junior doctors strike. However, in attempting to avoid a strike, Hunt, with his myopic politics, misses the crux of the issue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The contract he proposes to enforce shows how little respect he has for my profession, which has lost all trust in him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite Australia offering nearly twice the salary for 10 fewer hours a fortnight, and much greater respect from its government, I was planning on returning to NHS England next August. That’s no longer the case and the tipping point for me has been Hunt’s constant attacks. I am not prepared to work for a government that undermines me daily. The contract he proposes to enforce demonstrates how little respect he has for my profession, which has lost all trust in him. Irretrievably. Even if a strike is avoided, junior doctors will simply leave or not come back to NHS England if this contract is imposed.</p> <p>As a cabinet minister of a Conservative government, Hunt, I am sure, understands that, while the employment market of doctors is far from representative of a strictly free market, we do have options to sell our trade elsewhere and we will. The employment opportunities are many and our degrees and training are valued highly, often more so than native graduates.</p> <p>Those who have families may well find a move to the southern hemisphere difficult, but Scotland and Wales have dismissed Hunt’s draconian contract, providing alternative employment opportunities closer to home. Others are seeking work outside medicine.</p> <p>Junior doctors are a highly educated, skilled and motivated workforce with a multitude of transferable skills. Our opportunities for employment in private industry are many. Make no mistake, Mr Hunt, junior doctors will leave NHS England to work where they are valued and respected. </p>","internalOctopusCode":"10956116","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402910","internalRevision":"55","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"The health secretary has indulged in falsehoods such as blaming consultants and then junior doctors for 11,000 ‘excess deaths’ at weekends","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"More doctors like me will turn their backs on the UK","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Nick Rhead","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T00:04:02Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f50dd3ebbbf617540105735289cbeaf8a59d0ecf/38_184_5728_3435/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e24t","wordcount":"692","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f50dd3ebbbf617540105735289cbeaf8a59d0ecf/38_184_5728_3435/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563cd02ae4b0ace666f8b81a","newspaperPageNumber":"39","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T00:04:02Z","standfirst":"<p>The health secretary has indulged in falsehoods such as blaming consultants and then junior doctors for 11,000 ‘excess deaths’ at weekends</p>","linkText":"More doctors like me will turn their backs on the UK | Nick Rhead","creationDate":"2015-11-06T16:07:06Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-12-03T15:49:21Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458348967"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/jeremy-hunt-phoney-pay-rise-junior-doctors","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/jeremy-hunt-phoney-pay-rise-junior-doctors","sectionName":"Opinion","elements":[{"id":"f50dd3ebbbf617540105735289cbeaf8a59d0ecf","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f50dd3ebbbf617540105735289cbeaf8a59d0ecf/38_184_5728_3435/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2015 Rex Features.

And as that happens, our relationship with the EU must change too.</p> <p>I wrote to the prime minister immediately after the general election setting out five areas where businesses across the UK want to see change. First, guarantees for Britain and other non-eurozone countries. Since the UK is unlikely ever to join the euro, we need to ensure that our trade and financial interests are protected. Without this, there is a danger that we will be marginalised and politically and economically damaged.</p> <p>Second, we need a cast-iron UK opt-out from the principle of “ever-closer union”. Our surveys show that UK businesses want to see the locus of power shift back from Brussels to Westminster, something that would be difficult unless we can put a brake on further integration.</p> <p>Third, business demands a single market that actually works. The UK is, by and large, a service sector economy, yet there is simply no meaningful internal market in services within the EU. At the same time, the single market in goods is imperfect and unravelling. There has always been a question over the level of commitment from some member states about achieving a true single market. If the prime minister is serious about ensuring the EU works for British business, then a root-and-branch reform of the internal market is critical.</p> <p>Fourth, the regulatory burden from Brussels needs to be pared back and what remains must be enforced equally across all countries. Although the European Commission has embraced the idea of focusing on enforcement of the rules, there is no sign that this applies in practice.</p> <p>If the European regulations aren’t being applied equally, then the prime minister should seek to protect UK businesses from additional burdens – again, through an opt-out if necessary. There needs to be an option for a red card for regulation that does not relate directly to trade, which can prevent businesses from scaling up and breaking into new markets.</p> <p>Fifth, and finally, there must be some sort of balanced agreement on migration. The ongoing refugee crisis has kept this issue at the front of public consciousness. There must be a plan that is driven by the skills requirements of our economy, so that businesses can access the talent they need while taking into account the need for stability and long-term social cohesion.</p> <p>The coming year is set to be pivotal for our country and our future prosperity. If the prime minister sets the right objectives for his EU renegotiation, he will help create a better environment for British business success and the EU will benefit too. However, if the key business issues are overlooked, an important opportunity to recast our relationship with the EU may well be wasted for a generation – or even for ever, as the result may be that we are no longer members of the club.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959134","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403187","internalRevision":"90","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Despite what Westminster and global giants argue, retaining the status quo is not an option","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"British business interests must lie at the heart of Cameron’s EU negotiations","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"John Longworth","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T00:05:01Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/dec794d9fb3b39cfbd97b21bff96d8d5cfacb310/0_0_5000_3003/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2ep","wordcount":"651","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/dec794d9fb3b39cfbd97b21bff96d8d5cfacb310/0_0_5000_3003/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563def8fe4b05e53c04d4c0e","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T00:05:01Z","standfirst":"<p>Despite what Westminster and global giants argue, retaining the status quo is not an option</p>","linkText":"British business interests must lie at the heart of Cameron’s EU negotiations | John Longworth","creationDate":"2015-11-07T12:33:19Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-12-03T15:49:22Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458351623"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/john-longworth-british-business-interests-must-be-at-the-heart-of-camerons-european-negotiations","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/john-longworth-british-business-interests-must-be-at-the-heart-of-camerons-european-negotiations","sectionName":"Opinion","elements":[{"id":"dec794d9fb3b39cfbd97b21bff96d8d5cfacb310","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/dec794d9fb3b39cfbd97b21bff96d8d5cfacb310/0_0_5000_3003/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

But Britain, once regarded as a global leader, has relegated itself to the ranks of those reluctantly being pulled along in Obama’s wake.</p> <p>Since the election, the government has performed a series of dizzying U-turns on its green policies. It has announced cuts to subsidies for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\" title=\"\">onshore wind and solar energy</a>; scrapped the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/uk-scraps-zero-carbon-home-target\" title=\"\">zero carbon</a> homes standard; ended the green deal for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/uk-ceases-financing-of-green-deal\" title=\"\">home insulation</a>; and reversed its promise to exclude <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/16/government-makes-outrageous-u-turn-over-fracking-in-precious-wildlife-sites\" title=\"\">national parks</a> from fracking.</p> <p>There is no question that the green policy framework has been ripe for reform. Some subsidies have been unnecessarily generous and the green levies that pay for them are highly regressive, costing poor households <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publications/when-the-levy-breaks-energy-bills-green-levies-and-a-fairer-low-carbon-transition\" title=\"\">six times as much</a> of their income than the most affluent.</p> <p>But to scrap many subsidies and regulations altogether will be hugely damaging to Britain’s efforts to reduce emissions and is antithetical to Mr Cameron’s 2010 pledge to lead the “greenest government ever”. It is vital that any framework provides long-term certainty to encourage private investment in green technology. Any reform therefore needs to be gradual and signalled well in advance to maintain industry confidence. But to the alarm of green NGOs and business groups alike, the government has ripped up its green policy framework overnight. This will have a long-term effect on investment, and not just in the green sector: business will question whether they can take government commitments at face value.</p> <p>The implications for the UK’s targets to reduce carbon emissions are serious: the independent advisory committee on climate change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/uk-risks-missing-its-carbon-targets-climate-advisers-warn\" title=\"\">has warned they are now at risk</a>. And internationally, the timing of the about-turn could not be worse, with global leadership more important than ever in the lead up to Paris. The success of the summit is predicated on countries pushing each other to go further in signing up to targets enshrined in national legislation than they would have done without international co-operation. The targets on the table represent huge progress since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\" title=\"\">2009 Copenhagen summit</a>, but more will be needed to limit global warming to the internationally agreed target of two degrees.</p> <p>International leadership will be critical in achieving this, but the UK has stepped back from the leadership role it previously played. George Osborne has explicitly argued that Britain should be going no further than other countries in reducing global warming. If the US, China and India took this attitude, the Paris summit would quickly result in a race to the bottom. The frustration the US is feeling with Britain was evident in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/al-gore-puzzled-by-ukcuts-to-renewable-energy-support\" title=\"\">Al Gore’s September speech</a> in London: a damning indictment of Britain’s new backseat approach.</p> <p>The Tories have appeared cynical on climate change. In 2006, freshly elected as party leader, Cameron grasped on the green agenda as a way of modernising the Conservative brand. In coalition, the Lib Dems strongly pushed the green policies. So it has only really been since the election in May that the utter lack of Conservative commitment in this area has become so apparent.</p> <p>The green agenda is problematic for the leadership, with Tory backbenchers worried about the unpopularity of onshore wind and green energy levies. But it is clearly not an area Cameron is willing to push: climate change barely got a mention in his conference speech last month. This is in stark contrast to the second-term Obama, who is using the fact he no longer faces re-election to reinvigorate his leadership on climate change.</p> <p>It sets the UK out of kilter with the global dynamic: growing numbers of business leaders embracing the need for action, and countries such as China now part of the international consensus. The Bank of England governor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/29/carney-warns-of-risks-from-climate-change-tragedy-of-the-horizon\" title=\"\">Mark Carney’s recent speech</a> to Lloyd’s on the financial risks of climate change was a signal that the debate had reached the zenith of business thinking.</p> <p>All national leaders have to manage the tension between domestic politics and international affairs. But whether on climate change or Europe, Britain increasingly looks a country for whom short-term domestic politics always trumps international relationships and global co-operation. Our lack of leadership to slow global warming is not just bad for our planet’s climate – it is bad for our long-term national interest.</p>

Burmese hope will finally give them sway over a repressive military elite that took control in 1962.<br /></p> <p>The army has preserved much of its power through constitutional provisions that reserve the most important cabinet posts for the military. And many from the country’s persecuted minority Muslim population and others displaced by conflict are ineligible to vote. Nevertheless, the historic poll is being touted by foreign governments as the first credible election in half a century.</p> <p>Competing rallies have barged through towns and villages over the past two months, with screaming music from loudspeakers hitched on to the sides of trucks. Those waving red flags back the long-time democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi, while those with green support former general and current president Thein Sein, who came to power after a internationally condemned 2010 election.</p> <p>Public information cartoons of how people can vote were slapped on walls across the country months ago. Indelible ink pots have been sent out to 46,000 polling stations.</p> <p>“One of the things that is different this year is that the government has welcomed international observation,” Britain’s ambassador, Andrew Patrick, told the <em>Observer</em> in the former colonial capital of Rangoon, now the country’s largest city and renamed Yangon. “We have 25 embassy teams around the country.”</p> <p>Sein has pushed through reforms, releasing political prisoners, allowing a relatively independent press to thrive and opening the long-isolated economy to foreign investment after sanctions were lifted.</p> <p>But critics of the former junta and their handpicked civilian government say that, while the economy has opened up, the rewards have not been shared and political freedoms are few.</p> <p>Most people interviewed by the <em>Observer</em> in Yangonin the run-up to the polls were unwilling to talk about politics openly, suggesting they are still fearful of speaking out against the regime.</p> <p>Um Myint Thein, a 60-year-old who runs a family business selling monks’ robes, said: “The change in Myanmar is moving faster and everyone expects this election to be the best so far.” Asked who he wanted to win, he laughed and said “that’s politics”.</p> <p>Khine Thay, 35, a former secondary school teacher who set up a newspaper stand in Yangon four years ago, said she’s voting for Aung San Suu Kyi’s NLD. Thay has more than two dozen papers and magazines on a wooden stand, shaded by a plastic tarp on the side of the road.</p> <p>“All that’s changed since the reforms started has been the new buildings and the new roads,” she said, cooling herself with a hand fan and sitting on a plastic stool. “I believe that the NLD can make Myanmar free.”</p> <p>However, the fact that the woman is selling newspapers showing Aung San Suu Kyi’s face and many that include criticism of the authorities is a giant leap from pre-2010 Myanmar.</p> <p>Her bestselling weekly is <em>The Sun Rays</em>, whose front page shows Aung San Suu Kyi’s face next to a photograph of Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. “Who will be the next president?” the headline reads.</p> <p>Under the 2008 military-drafted constitution, Aung San Suu Kyi can never be president. Burmese with foreign children are barred from the country’s top post and her two sons hold British citizenship.</p> <p>The 70-year-old politician who has spent years under house arrest dismissed the constitution as “silly” last week and said she would be “above the president” if her party triumphs.</p> <p>That will be hard. A quarter of all seats in parliament are reserved for the army , which also has an effective veto on constitutional change. The interior and home ministry portfolios are also reserved for men in uniform. The army also picks one of the three presidential candidates who will be appointed by parliament next year.</p> <p>Thant Myint-U, a Burmese historian and author, told the <em>Observer</em> that, even if there is an overwhelming NLD victory, the generals have safeguarded themselves. “They have crafted the constitution that includes a minimum amount of control that is acceptable to them,” he said.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959525","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403257","internalRevision":"71","publication":"The

Normally, he has nothing but good things to say about his neighbourhood, one of the most affluent in Los Angeles, where the streets are lined with opulent houses and well-tended flowerbeds. Jennifer Aniston, Nicolas Cage and Kim Kardashian have homes here. It’s a nice place to live.</p> <p>But today Gamburd, a former firearms consultant in his 60s, is angry. Very angry. “It’s criminal,” he says, sitting at a table outside Starbucks. “There’s no other word to use.”</p> <p>The subject of his ire is not some hardened gangster or local tearaway, but an unknown resident who has been dubbed <a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/article/the-wet-prince-of-bel-air-who-is-californias-biggest-water-guzzler/\">the Wet Prince of Bel Air</a>. This anonymous person has recently been outed for using an astonishing 11.8m gallons of water in one year while the rest of the state is struggling to tackle one of the worst droughts in living memory.</p> <p>The Wet Prince is the biggest known residential water consumer in the state, according to records obtained by the Centre for Investigative Reporting in California. In the 12 months to April, they used enough water to sustain 90 average households or flush a toilet 20,000 times every day.</p> <p>“It’s hard to imagine how someone could use so much water,” says Max Gomberg, climate and conservation manager at the State Water Resources Control Board. “It’s appalling. What are they doing on that property?”</p> <p>The city authorities have refused to identify the culprit, citing data protection issues. But, just like Dean Gamburd, many of the other residents of Bel Air are seething.</p> <p>“It’s selfish and self-indulgent” says Kate Stensland. “What’s the bottom line? For these people it seems to be: ‘Well, it’s not me, not my world, it has nothing to do with me’.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0928b9f9b78538af1152cd3a30a00a15287f2a8d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0928b9f9b78538af1152cd3a30a00a15287f2a8d/0_50_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drought-stricken hills above San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman walks her dog on the drought-stricken hills above San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jerry Brown, the governor of California, declared a state of emergency last year, and in April imposed a mandatory 25% cutback on water use. That means any outdoor watering that causes “runoff” (excess water running down a pavement for instance), or washing your car with a hose can land you with a $500 (£332) fine.</p> <p>Public information campaigns have urged Californians to do everything to help, from limiting their toilet flushing to putting a bucket in the shower to catch overflow to water their plants. The campaign has been a success: in August, the state authorities said urban customers had cut their use by 31%.</p> <p>But well-heeled residents in the wealthier parts of Los Angeles often choose to pay the fines simply in order to keep their swimming pools full and their landscaped gardens lush. Bel Air is home to 19 customers pumping more than 2.8m gallons a year. In Beverly Hills, 32 customers used that amount or more.</p> <p>Many of LA’s multimillionaires have several properties across the globe and might not be aware of any leaks. Whatever the explanation, their water consumption has a deleterious impact.</p> <p>“The situation is really bad,” says Gomberg. “We have communities who have literally run out of water because the wells have run dry.”</p> <p>Los Angeles is a city built on desert that relies on water sourced hundreds of miles away from the Colorado river, the Delta in northern California and the snow pack of the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains.</p> <p>“We have the lowest snow pack in 500 years, which is a third of our water supply,” says Gomberg. “We lost 22m trees because of the stress brought on from the drought and because the wildfires have been so much worse because there’s no moisture. Fish are dying because the water in the river is not there. Over 10,000 people are out of work because hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland have been left fallow because of the lack of water supply.”</p> <p>Faced with this grim situation, the residents of Bel Air have taken matters into their own hands. The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has reported the existence of “a drought posse” who scour satellite maps and trace neighbourhood gutter flows. There is even talk that one inhabitant is using a camera-equipped drone to identify the water guzzlers.</p> <p>No one yet knows who the Wet Prince might be, but Bel Air is not a place where anyone does anything by halves. A billionaire called James Goldstein, for instance, has recreated a tropical jungle in the gardens of his mansion. (The house itself has been used as a backdrop for a Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6diBt5lx3xM\">music video</a> and Rihanna held her birthday party there this year.) There’s no doubt that maintaining a tropical jungle in a desert climate probably requires a fair amount of water.</p> <p>Gamburd knows of several houses where the fountains are left flowing 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Walking around Bel Air, one is immediately struck by the lushness and verdancy of its vegetation.</p> <p>There is the near-constant sound of trickling water from behind high hedges which shield the more impressive houses from public view. On the street, parked between the Porsches and Range Rovers, are vans bearing the insignia of pool maintenance companies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2015/oct/15/california-drought-wouldnt-be-so-bad-if-the-rest-of-you-would-share-some-water\">California's drought wouldn't be so bad if the rest of you would share some water | W Kamau Bell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maureen Levinson, a member of the Bel Air Beverly Crest Neighbourhood Council, nevertheless insists that most residents “have engaged in water conservation efforts”. The bigger concern, she says, is the construction of super-sized luxury homes in the area (locally referred to as “giga-mansions”).</p> <p>“These development projects include excessive numbers of pools and water features,” says Levinson. She cites one instance where the city authorities have approved five massive pools for a single family dwelling.</p> <p>“If the city wants to curb the excessive water usages, we need to push and support our city council for change in building codes and ordinances – and to scrutinise the overall consequences of out-of-scale, new speculatively built, commercial-sized ‘single family dwellings’ currently under construction.”</p> <p>Back at Starbucks, Gamburd says the 11.8m gallon water guzzler could be one of several people. “I don’t believe he’s the only one,” he said.</p> <p>A uniformed caretaker has started watering the flowerpots in front of us. He is carrying a bucket which is only half full. He stops at one pot, bends down, presses the soil with his thumb to check the moisture and then moves on without watering it. Across the street, in the gardens of the mega-rich, the decorative fountains continue playing.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10958117","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403121","internalRevision":"380","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"As residents cut water use, even the rich rage at the mysterious ‘Wet Prince of Bel Air’, who used 11.8m gallons in one year","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Anger drives hunt for 'criminal' water guzzler during California drought","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Elizabeth Day in Los Angeles","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T00:04:04Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ffcee712892fd1e36ecc54f4409501df6b6738e/0_49_3300_1977/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2cd","wordcount":"1061","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/7ffcee712892fd1e36ecc54f4409501df6b6738e/0_49_3300_1977/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563d2e4fe4b09da63347fc8f","newspaperPageNumber":"25","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T00:04:04Z","standfirst":"<p>As residents cut water use, even the rich rage at the mysterious ‘Wet Prince of Bel Air’, who used 11.8m gallons in one year</p>","linkText":"Anger drives hunt for 'criminal' water guzzler during California drought","creationDate":"2015-11-06T22:48:47Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-08T23:00:10Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458351103"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/08/drought-posse-los-angeles-water-guzzlers-bel-air-wet-prince","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/nov/08/drought-posse-los-angeles-water-guzzlers-bel-air-wet-prince","sectionName":"US news","elements":[{"id":"7ffcee712892fd1e36ecc54f4409501df6b6738e","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/7ffcee712892fd1e36ecc54f4409501df6b6738e/0_49_3300_1977/2000.jpg","typeData":{"picdarUrn":"GD*47608432","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/7ffcee712892fd1e36ecc54f4409501df6b6738e","suppliersReference":"TOR434","altText":"A sprinkler in use at a home in California.

At the Baroipara checkpoint, near the industrial area of Ashulia, stalls offer tea and snacks to local workers and visitors to a nearby public park.</p> <p>At 7.30am on 4 November, five policemen were dropped off at the checkpoint for a day-long shift and sat down for tea on benches shaded by tall, slender sal trees. The attack was so sudden they could barely react. Their assailants rode up on motorbikes, dismounted and then struck out with machetes. Two of the policemen were badly injured. One bled to death on the dusty roadside.</p> <p>Tea is no longer being served at Baroipara. “We have stayed shut out of fear,” said Shamsul Alam, the owner of one stall. “I’m scared. If a cop can be killed, who knows what can happen to common people like us?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/bangladesh-ideological-murders-attack-liberal-ideals\">Bangladesh’s ideological murders are a further attack on its liberal ideals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alam is not alone. The Baroipara killing came after the murders of two foreigners – an Italian and a Japanese national in Bangladesh – which were both claimed by Islamic State, which is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/isis-possible-culprits-suspected-plane-attack\">suspected of bombing the Russian holiday jet in Egypt</a> last weekend. Then there has been the series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/faisal-abedin-deepan-bangladesh-secular-publisher-hacked-to-death\">murders of secular intellectuals, bloggers and publishers</a>. Five have now died over the last year. These murders have been claimed by a local affiliate of al-Qaida in the Indian subcontinent.</p> <p>Many in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country of 160 million-plus, are now frightened. “I am working in the university and all my friends are really panicked. No one knows what could happen or when,” said <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/why-being-openly-secular-can-get-you-killed/a-18557741\">Shantanu Majumder</a>, a political scientist and activist. “Bangladesh has changed completely. This is not our usual, easy life. The [extremists] may not be strong enough to start a civil war, but they are strong enough to continue their killing mission.”</p> <p>There is no doubt that such anxiety is real and justified, and al-Qaida and Isis have thus succeeded in attaining the goal of all such militant groups: to terrorise their enemies, mobilise existing supporters and polarise communities to create the conditions that favour extremism.</p> <p>The entry of the two groups into Bangladesh is relatively recent; the ground for their horrific campaigns of violence there has been prepared by historical, social, economic and political factors reaching back almost 50 years, if not longer.</p> <p>The borders of modern Bangladesh were drawn in 1947, when the British divided their south Asian empire. Most Muslim-majority areas became part of Pakistan, which was itself split into east and west wings. In 1971, civil war broke out between local nationalists in East Pakistan who wanted independence and those who did not. The former, on the whole, spoke the local language of Bangla, favoured socialist-style economic policies and desired a liberal, secular framework for their new nation. Most of those who favoured a continued union with Pakistan were religiously and socially conservative.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/21/ian-jack-bangladesh-war-genocide\">The ensuing conflict was brutal</a>, with hundreds of thousands killed and some of the worst atrocities committed by militias recruited by Pakistani forces, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/24/bangladesh-at-40\">resulted in an independent country</a> with a secular constitution.

She heads the Awami League. The rival Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) has long represented more conservative elements and is led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/mob-attacks-bangladesh-opposition-leader-during-election-rally\">Khaleda Zia</a>, the widow of the military dictator who took power in the aftermath of Mujibur’s death and was killed in 1981. The two women make little effort to hide their mutual hatred.</p> <p>Then there is the Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist political party and social movement which resisted independence and was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/bangladesh-islamist-abdul-quader-mollah-execution-protests\">implicated in some of the worst abuses</a>.</p> <p>All the parties have battled bitterly over the years, through the ballot box, political manoeuvres, cynical short-term alliances and on the streets. But if history has left a troubled legacy, so too has economic change.</p> <p>The view from the battered bridge over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2015/jan/29/photo-highlights-of-the-day#img-4\">Buriganga</a> river in the centre of Dhaka is apocalyptic. In the foreground are the black, heavily polluted waters of the river itself. Beyond lies Kamrangir Char, a vast slum where clouds of acrid smoke from burning rubbish hide tenements packed with thin men, anxious women and grubby children with tubercular coughs.</p> <p>But Kamrangir Char is also a thriving community and informal economic hub. Millions flock to similar slums in Dhaka and elsewhere every year, flowing in from rural areas hit by climate change-induced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/sep/10/flooding-in-bangladesh-in-pictures\">flooding</a>, overcultivation and unemployment. For all its problems, the slums, and Bangladesh’s chaotic, congested cities more generally, act as launching pads into better lives than many could ever have lived in their remote villages.</p> <p>Recent years have seen steady economic growth. Incomes and literacy levels have risen. Infant malnutrition and maternal mortality are down. One factor is the $25bn garment business, which makes cheap clothes for the west and employs at least four million people. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/bangladesh-factory-building-collapse-community\">deaths of 1,000 workers when a garment factory collapsed</a> in 2013 underlined problems of poor safety and conditions, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/sep/25/sheikh-hasina-i-want-to-make-bangladesh-poverty-free-sustainable-development-goals\">the days when Bangladesh was dismissed as a “basket case” are long gone</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"818a496412f7be258fbb4fb5b9180b323fb548ed\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/818a496412f7be258fbb4fb5b9180b323fb548ed/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women at work in a Bangladeshi garment factory\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women at work in a Bangladeshi garment factory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Demotix/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As elsewhere in the Islamic world, however, development has not ended the threat of radicalism. Indeed, some believe it may even have fuelled it.</p> <p>According to one western intelligence official based in the region, those least equipped to thrive in the new better-off Bangladesh are young men, often from rural backgrounds but raised in the big city, whose poor education and lack of skills, social or professional, is a huge disadvantage amid cut-throat competition for jobs, money, status and eligible marriage partners. “Many, many Islamic militant recruits in Bangladesh and more broadly across the Islamic world match that profile, and that is no coincidence,” the official said.</p> <p>Others, however, deny the link. “In principle, everyone wins from growth. This is a broader phenomenon. No Islamic country has been untouched by the global crosscurrent of radicalism in recent years,” said Ahsan Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, a Dhaka-based thinktank.</p> <p>As elsewhere, Bangladesh’s new global commercial and cultural links are also a factor. The millions of Bangladeshi migrant workers in places such as Qatar or Saudi Arabia are exposed to austere styles of Islam very different from the traditional, folksy forms of worship of their homeland. Over decades, cash from the Gulf has funded religious seminaries and institutions in Bangladesh.</p> <p>Clerics at one such school in Kamrangir Char told the <em>Guardian</em> two years ago that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/16/bangladesh-hefazat-e-islam-women\">their primary aim was to stop “alien [western] culture” making inroads </a>in Bangladesh. Several of those detained for the recent militant attacks were seminary students. Such institutions teach hardline unitarian dogmas which, even if they are theoretically non-violent, are certainly intolerant.</p> <p>Then there is the impact of nearly 15 years of conflict, invasion and rhetoric across the Islamic world, relayed by social media. This, <a href=\"http://www.dhakatribune.com/op-ed/2015/nov/06/why-have-we-sounded-death-knell-secularism\">according to columnist Shuprova Tasneem, has contributed to “a growing distrust of western concepts of secularism</a>, viewed as an ideology that not only disassociates religion from state affairs but attempts to reduce its influence in our private lives as well.”</p> <p>There have long been signs of rising radicalism. Attacks on Christians and Hindus have intensified. Last month Bangladesh’s small <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/bomb-attack-on-bangladesh-shia-community\">Shia Muslim community – reviled as heretics in many Gulf countries – were targeted by a bomb claimed by Isis</a>. Yet the final impetus to the new violence may have come from the very people who say they want to stop it.</p> <p>Shortly after returning to power in 2009, the new Awami League government set up a special tribunal to try those allegedly responsible for atrocities in the 1971 war. The party said it was bringing closure through justice. Many, though not all, of those in the dock were senior Islamists, and human rights groups were critical of the trials. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/13/bangladesh-islamist-abdul-quader-mollah-execution-protests\">sentences that were pronounced by the court led to huge protests</a> and counter-protests by supporters and opponents of the process. “The trial of the war criminals is key. The problems all started then,” said Majumder, the political scientist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce7ab5f8cfd9898de7f4b5008b4b5cc28720770d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ce7ab5f8cfd9898de7f4b5008b4b5cc28720770d/0_215_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamaat-e-Islami supporters set fire to a bus in protest at sentences handed down by a war crimes tribunal in 2013\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamaat-e-Islami supporters set fire to a bus in protest at sentences handed down by a war crimes tribunal in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In January 2014, Bangladesh held a widely criticised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/05/bangladesh\">election boycotted by the BNP and other opposition parties</a>. The Awami League won, but the poll triggered intense street violence. Hundreds were killed or injured in firebombings and riots as the opposition tried to oust the government. With many of its leaders detained or in hiding, the BNP has been almost eliminated as a political force. So, too, have the Islamists of Jamaat-e-Islami. The result is no credible opposition – and no democratic channel to express dissent.</p> <p>“The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/21/bangladesh-prime-minister-rejects-accusations-of-authoritarian-rule\">crackdown</a> has been so hard that it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of extremism,” said Michael Kugelman, a south Asia expert at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington DC.</p> <p>Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister, denies that Isis exists in Bangladesh. <a href=\"http://www.theindependentbd.com/post/17952\">She blames opposition parties both for the recent killings</a> and for the broader problem of extremism. This, said Kugelman, indicated a “complacency” that was “counterproductive at the very least”.</p> <p>Few believe either Isis or al-Qaida has a substantial presence in Bangladesh. But, despite attracting only a tiny fraction of Bangladeshis, it is clear that both have enough followers to continue, and possibly expand, the <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/bangladesh-arrests-men-killings-bloggers-150910174617040.html\">current campaign of violence</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/88504/Cop-stabbed-to-death-again--\">Mukul Hossain</a>, the policeman killed in Wednesday’s attack, was buried at his village home in Bogra, 150 miles north-west of Dhaka. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a colleague expressed, with some understatement, the sentiments of many: “Our country has been peaceful, but recently it has become a bit troubled,” he said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Saad Hammadi in Ashulia</em></p> <h2>NATIONAL PROFILE</h2> <p><strong>Population</strong> 159.1 million, with an annual growth rate of 1.2%, rising to 3.6% in urban areas.</p> <p><strong>Capital city</strong> Dhaka (population: 16.9m).</p> <p><strong>Area</strong> 147,570 square kilometres.</p> <p><strong>Life expectancy</strong> 71.3 years for women, 69.8 years for men.</p> <p><strong>Unemployment</strong> 4.3%.

Australia.</a> It’s a disturbing trend: but as the dissatisfaction over hours and conditions in the NHS grows, it may be one we have to get used to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link

can't face being a doctor any more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia has long attracted doctors from Britain. Depending on their seniority, doctors can earn up to 50% more in Sydney or Melbourne, despite generally working less overtime. With the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/04/jeremy-hunt-pay-rise-offer-to-junior-doctors-is-nothing-of-the-sort\">threatening to impose a tough new contract on junior doctors </a>– one that would see their working hours increased and pay cut – the lure of Australia is growing.</p> <p>This should be particularly worrying for the NHS, given that a review published last week found the UK would need 26,500 more doctors and 47,700 nurses to match the OECD average.</p> <p>The UK provided Australia with 13% of its GPs and 22% of its specialists in 2011. The crisis could see these numbers rise. The latest General Medical Council figures show that in the 10 days after the Hunt contracts were confirmed, doctors made 3,468 requests for a certificate to practise medicine outside of the UK. The regulator normally gets between 20 and 25 requests a day.</p> <p>Associate professor Brian Owler, who is head of the Australian Medical Association, said junior doctors should be “highly valued” and is critical of the NHS contract changes.</p> <p>“Junior doctors are almost the engine room of the hospital system,” he said. “They’re the ones that are there every day waiting on patients and sorting out tests, they’re the ones that are still there at night, and without them the whole system grinds to a halt. They’re a bit undervalued sometimes in the services they provide – they’re training as well as working – and people forget how essential they are. Without them, care would suffer.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a6d971dcb39110c79224ba8556969e1e6afc56a0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a6d971dcb39110c79224ba8556969e1e6afc56a0/1980_0_1941_2912/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Wollaston MP\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Wollaston MP’s daughter is one of many young doctors to leave the NHS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Doctors came to Australia from the UK for a number of reasons, he said, including Australia’s high training standards and beaches-and-sunshine lifestyle.</p> <p>“And there have also been quite a number of general practitioners and other doctors come to us because they found conditions under the NHS difficult,” he said. “Yes, we have our challenges here, but we know that there have been quite a number of challenges, particularly in general practice, over a number of years in the UK.”</p> <h2>THREE DOCTORS WHO MOVED</h2> <p><strong>Joe Marwood, 31</strong><br />St Vincent’s hospital, Sydney</p> <p>“My plan was just to get a year’s worth of experience in a different culture and environment, and it turned out to be too hard to leave,” Joe Marwood said.</p> <p>He left Britain in August 2012 and works in the emergency department. “There’s an excellent team at St Vincent’s hospital, and I enjoy my work so much. The training programme is great, and the work-life balance is far greater here.”</p> <p>He spent two years working in British hospitals and said he used to work a significant amount of overtime for no extra pay. “Here, there’s fewer hours worked per week. While the money is better, even before the proposed changes to the NHS, that wasn’t a factor in me coming here. It’s the training, the conditions, the lifestyle. You can get more out of life.”</p> <p>Marwood said he also felt valued by his employer, a feeling he said his peers back home did not share. “There’s no doubt that if you take a group of highly skilled people who feel completely undervalued by their employer in the UK, they’re going to exercise their right to find more rewarding employment elsewhere,” he said. “Not just financially, but also in terms of finding somewhere psychologically rewarding, and being able to believe that their employer values them.”</p> <p>Marwood, who studied at the University of Cambridge and University College London, said he could not see himself going back until he was a senior doctor and even then only if overall working conditions under the NHS improved.</p> <p><strong>Mel Poole, 35</strong><br />Royal Melbourne hospital</p> <p>Mel Poole arrived in Australia in August to complete her final year of training as an anaesthetics registrar. She hoped the experience would help her to develop her clinical skills before she becomes a consultant.</p> <p>“I have to return to the UK for six months because of my training, but then I have to plan whether to come back overseas again, and Australia would be high on the list if I did,” Poole said.</p> <p>Her basic pay as a senior registrar was almost 30% higher than what it would be in the UK. While Poole says money was not her primary motivation, her employment conditions in Australia allowed her to achieve a healthier work-life balance. “I’m a British doctor, and I always anticipated I would work in the NHS for the majority of my career, even if I went abroad for short periods,” said Poole, who studied at Leicester Medical School. “But it’s pretty depressing, to be honest, to see what junior doctors are going through, and quite demoralising.</p> <p>“I really believe in the NHS, and the concern of junior doctors is of course for their own positions, but it’s also for the future of the NHS as a whole. Junior doctors also rely on the NHS to provide for us when we are sick, as do our parents, friends and family. Our interests are not selfish.</p> <p>“It just amazes me that David Cameron and the Conservatives gave promise after promise that the NHS would be safe in their hands, and then they would appoint a health secretary [Jeremy Hunt] who has published a book on privatising the NHS, and who is doing his best to destabilise it.”</p> <p>A number of Poole’s friends from the UK had also come to Australia after finishing their studies, she said. “They have come across when junior doctors and decided to stay because they felt the lifestyle here was better than at home.”</p> <p><strong>Danielle Woods, 26</strong><br />Royal Melbourne hospital</p> <p>When Danielle Woods (not her real name) moved to Australia to practise emergency medicine in August last year, she thought she would stay only for six months. She came because she had always wanted to travel. Rather than stall her medical training, she decided to embark on a working holiday.</p> <p>But more than a year later, she has no intention of leaving Melbourne any time soon. “I’m paid more here, I work shorter hours, and those hours are quite protected,” she said. “You find at the end of your rostered day, people make sure you go home on time. In England, there was always pressure to stay on and work longer.”</p> <p>While studying at Peninsula College of Medicine in Devon, she said many of her fellow students spoke of their desire to go to Australia because of a combination of work and lifestyle. However, Woods said she did feel a loyalty to the NHS, given it was the system that trained her. Her family are also still in England.</p> <p>“But I think it’s completely outrageous, the disparity in working conditions between here and home,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s shocking to me, the proposed changes affecting junior doctors. There’s a Facebook group I’m part of, of junior doctors back home, and I’m updated all day every day about the dissatisfaction they are feeling. The idea that junior doctors are being greedy and lacking vocation … it’s very interesting that people can put that spin on it.”</p> <p>Her training opportunities in Australia, combined with better pay and work-life balance, were the key factors keeping her there. “But I do still believe in the NHS overall, and if the NHS could guarantee the same lifestyle my working conditions in Australia allow me, I would go back,” she said. “Definitely.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10958911","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403221","internalRevision":"88","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"As the row over junior doctors’ contracts intensifies, thousands of NHS staff are applying to work abroad.

Now, 50 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/10/from-tom-to-ts-eliot-world-poet\" title=\"to Guardian anniv appraisal\">years after his death</a>, an amateur British scholar is creating waves in the growing academic world of Eliot studies because he believes he has unravelled a long-running literary riddle that shows what Eliot meant: the poet was playing a drawn-out game with names that split his identity in three.</p> <p>The poet’s fondness for crosswords, for Scrabble and for the puns he used in letters to his friend Groucho Marx offered the first clue. An ardent Eliot fan from Glasgow, David Liston, 59, began to look for wordplay and now thinks the answer has been there for all to see <a href=\"http://thewasteland.touchpress.com\" title=\"link to app site\">in the poem <em>The Waste Land</em></a>, perhaps the greatest English-language work of the 20th century. Eliot experts have long wondered about the name of one of the poem’s many fleeting characters. At one point an English bank clerk called Stetson appears, and his ostensibly American name has often leaped out at readers:</p> <p><em>There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: “Stetson!</em></p> <p><em>You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!”</em></p> <p>Rival theories have often suggested that Stetson might stand for Eliot himself, since he worked for Lloyds bank and was born in America. But the choice of such an unusual name has been variously linked to the Stetson hat maker (by Allen Ginsberg, among others); to feminist lecturer Charlotte Perkins Stetson; to an American banker (by Eliot’s wife, Valerie); and to a place in St Louis,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/11/young-eliot-st-louis-waste-land-robert-crawford-review\" title=\"review of biography\"> the poet’s birthplace</a>. More oddly, a link has been made to the hat worn by the Anzacs at Gallipoli. It was also thought to be a possible alternate identity for his friend and fellow poet, Ezra Pound.</p> <p>A demanding read, although written in popular slang in sections, <em>The Waste Land</em>’s verses, published in 1922, have been subjected to more close academic study than any other modern poem. Yet Liston, who previously worked in publishing, came across an anagram.</p> <p>Bearing in mind Eliot’s penchant for three-part names, including the hero of his well-known earlier work The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock, and the feline stars of his <em>Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats</em>, each said to have three names, Liston took the poet’s own name, Thomas Stearns Eliot, and spotted something: if you take out “Thomas”, and then transpose the letters of “Stearns Eliot”, you get “Ariel Stetson”, the names of the poetic force and the bank official in the poem.</p> <p>The Burial of the Dead section of the <em>The Waste Land</em> had originally started with a stanza about “Tom” (“First we had a couple of feelers down at Tom’s place, There was old Tom, boiled to the eyes, blind”), and the poem is recognised to contain many allusions to Shakespeare’s Ariel, the ethereal figure from <em>The Tempest</em> who is repeatedly associated with the poetic muse, including by Percy Bysshe Shelley and Sylvia Plath. Part of Ariel’s line, “Those are pearls that were his eyes” appears in <em>The Waste Land,</em> even though Pound tried to edit them out.</p> <p>Encouraged by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/29/poetry.oxforduniversity\" title=\"link to guardian\">respected academic Christopher Ricks</a>, who has recently updated his own theories about the poem, Liston put forward his idea to the TS Eliot Society, which has published it.</p> <p>Liston admits Eliot’s joke isn’t a great one: “‘Thomas Ariel Stetson’ would not have won many prizes as an anagram, but Eliot was not out to collect prizes,” he said. However, it does work as a hidden code, Liston believes, because the poet’s public only knew him as TS Eliot.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/craig-raine\" title=\"link to Guardian page on poet\">the award-winning poet and Eliot expert, Craig Raine</a>, is among those who are not convinced. He thinks the Stetson line about the ships at Mylae, a 260BC battle during the first Punic war, is there to point up the strong suggestion of previous lives lived that runs throughout <em>The Waste Land</em>.</p> <p>“The line means exactly what it says. It’s one of the most important lines in the poem, with huge implications,” said Raine, who spoke on this subject at the TS Eliot summer school this year. For him, Stetson stands clearly for 19th and 20th-century America. “The only thing that might make the statement possible would be that Stetson had a previous life and that the [narrative] speaker of <em>The Waste Land</em> had a previous life, too.”</p> <p>Liston argues that there is a theme or “hidden agenda” behind the anagram. It was an emblem of Eliot’s divided self, both as a poet and a person. Dubbed the “poet of impersonality”, Eliot is often quoted as suggesting poetry was “not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality” in his 1919 essay, <em>Tradition and the Individual Talent</em>.</p> <p>More support for the anagram theory comes from Eliot himself. “It’s interesting to cut yourself to pieces once in a while, and wait to see if the fragments will sprout,” he once wrote.</p> <p>In his 1933 Harvard lecture, the poet also said, “there may be personal causes which make it impossible for a poet to express himself in any but an obscure way.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10958619","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403164","internalRevision":"89","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Hidden anagram points to the poet himself as the bank clerk hailed in a London crowd, claims amateur fan","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Who is the mysterious ‘Stetson’ in TS Eliot’s Waste Land?

</figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p><strong> </strong>Reliance on voluntary action by alcohol firms to tackle drink-related harm has been a failure, a hard-hitting report warns. The “<a href=\"https://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk\" title=\"\">public health responsibility deal</a>” unveiled during the last government has resulted in broken promises and too little being done to reduce problems such as underage drinking, the report concludes.</p> <p>The scathing assessment by the <a href=\"http://www.ias.org.uk\" title=\"\">Institute of Alcohol Studies</a> (IAS) states: “[The responsibility deal] appears to have been the main element of the UK’s alcohol strategy in recent years and has been used by the industry to resist more effective policies. If this is the case, the responsibility deal has worsened the health of the nation, and so must be considered a failure.”</p> <p>The break with decades of regulation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/mar/15/lansley-health-strategy-flounders-refuse\" title=\"\">began under then coalition health secretary Andrew Lansley</a> in 2011. He hailed it as a groundbreaking public-private partnership that would reduce alcohol problems. But the IAS, a non-industry-funded thinktank, found that, under the deal, drinks producers have shunned policies that would work but would also hit their sales, promoted approaches that do not work, and exaggerated how much difference the policies they have adopted have actually made.</p> <p>“The RD has systematically focused on relatively ineffective interventions that are unlikely to reduce alcohol consumption. It has set up its pledges in ambiguous terms that resist assessment,” says the report. “The alcohol industry has obstructed rigorous evaluation of the RD, through the unreliability of its progress reports, and more damningly through its misconduct in the official evaluation process.”</p> <p>Katherine Brown, IAS director and one of the report’s authors, said that both hospital admissions and deaths due to alcohol had continued to rise, in spite of overall alcohol consumption falling slightly. “Perhaps most worryingly, the report indicates that the deal may have delayed evidence-based actions that would save lives and cut crime, such as minimum pricing. To call this a ‘public health responsibility deal’ for alcohol is laughable, as almost every independent public health body has boycotted it.”</p> <p>The RD’s failure meant it would be “absurd for this government to continue with such a farcical initiative. With alcohol costing our society £21bn each year, we can’t afford to keep prioritising the needs of big business over public health,” she added.</p> <p>The report claims there is no evidence that a key industry pledge – improving the labelling of cans and bottles to include drinking guidelines, warning labels and unit alcohol content – is working.</p> <p>Recent Department of Health-funded research by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that firms involved in the RD “are not fully meeting their commitments” on labelling, and that “labelling information frequently falls short of best practice, with fonts and logos smaller than would be accepted on other products with health effects”.</p> <p>The report does praise drinks firms for agreeing to stop advertising within 100 metres of schools. It also hails genuine “progress” on the number of alcohol products carrying warnings about drinking during pregnancy, safe drinking guidelines and the number of units contained.</p> <p>The Portman Group, an industry-funded body, criticised the report for “taking no account of official government data showing the achievements of the Responsibility Deal and repeating previous claims which we have already told the IAS are factually incorrect”.</p> <p>“By working in partnership with government, drinks producers and retailers have taken 1.3 billion units of alcohol out of the market, limited the number of units of alcohol in single-serve cans, and voluntarily labelled 80% of products with important health information, and over 90% with a warning about drinking when pregnant,” a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Since 2010 there has been a 24% drop in alcohol-related violent incidents and 13% fall in the number of 11-13-year-olds who have ever had a drink, she added.</p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said: “Under the Responsibility Deal we have seen over a billion units of alcohol removed from the market, through improving consumer choice of lower alcohol products, and nearly 93% of all alcohol products now carrying drinking in pregnancy warnings.</p> <p>“More importantly, we have seen the number of people drinking above the current guidelines in England fall over recent years. However, we also recognise that more needs to be done, and we will continue to challenge industry to go further.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959029","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403201","internalRevision":"57","publication":"The

In the interest of transparency, the names of those involved in the three work streams and their potential conflicts of interest will be published on our website</p> <p>To further address Dr Malhotra’s concerns, the academy supports the principles of transparency of research at the core of the AllTrials petition. While we cannot sign up to campaigns on behalf of our fellowship, we have encouraged our fellows to do so in a personal capacity since the campaign launched.</p> <p>Our support for transparency on clinical trials and AllTrials has been available on our website since 2013. </p> <p><strong>Sir John Tooke PMedSci</strong></p> <p>President, </p> <p>Academy of Medical Sciences</p> <p>London W1</p> <p>Dr Malhotra’s article highlights the modern phenomenon of “scepticaemia”. It is becoming increasingly popular to criticise primary research, reviewed retrospectively many years after its original publication with no reference to the original authors. Science is empirical and leads to gradual change. Malhotra talks of over-medicalisation; however, statins have undoubtedly saved more lives than they have harmed.</p> <p>Instead of the current preoccupation with pulling apart research done with the best intentions, perhaps the exponents of this phenomenon would do well to help improve research methodology rather than simply criticise it. I fear that even initiatives such as AllTrials will, through academic zealotry, lead to a climate of fear in science that will suppress legitimate research.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Beggs</strong></p> <p>Wellcome Trust clinician scientist fellow</p> <p>Institute of Cancer &amp; Genomic Medicine</p> <p>University of Birmingham</p> <p>Many older people are taking hundreds of pills a week and the article raises a hugely important issue concerning how we review and manage older people’s medicines. Recent research, published last week in Dispensing Health in Later Life, reveals that GPs are very concerned that their older patients are taking too many medicines and not taking them as prescribed.</p> <p>While Dr Malhotra outlines the responsibilities he believes lie with the pharmaceutical industry and policy makers, we believe there is a solution much closer to home. High street pharmacists can play a huge role in addressing this issue.</p> <p>Regular medicine use reviews, undertaken by high street pharmacists, would help older people take medicines correctly and understand potential side-effects. To achieve this, GPs and pharmacists must work closely together and pharmacists should be given access to basic health records, with the patient’s consent. Some 18.7 prescriptions are dispensed per person per year at a cost of £8.9bn, but ensuring correct use of medicines can help people take fewer medicines.</p> <p><strong>Professor Rob Darracott </strong>chief executive, Pharmacy Voice; <strong>Dr Nav Chana </strong>chairman, National Association of Primary Care;<strong> Janet Morrison </strong>chief executive, Independent Age;<strong> Rick Stern </strong>director, Primary Care Foundation;<strong> Dr Michael Dixon </strong>chairman, NHS Alliance; <strong>Professor Martin Green, </strong>chief executive, Care England</p> <p>Dr Malhorta writes that “it’s time to restrain the harms of too much medicine”.

</figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>There have been so many memorable moments in the race for the Republican presidential nomination so far, but one really sticks out. Donald Trump, when asked to name his favourite book, declared: “As much as I love <em>The Art of the Deal</em> [the bestselling book he wrote], it’s not even close. We take the Bible all the way.”</p> <p>This from a man who once called communion “my little wine and my little cracker,” and when asked if he preferred the New or the Old Testament said: “Probably equal. The whole Bible is just incredible.”</p> <p>Trump’s comments are very difficult to take seriously, but they tell an important tale – of the outsized role that religious faith plays on the presidential campaign trail and among both Democrats and Republicans. Today it is practically a pro forma exercise for presidential candidates to talk about how their faith-based belief systems influence their policy views or include lines from scripture in their speeches. Indeed, back in 2000, George W Bush claimed his favourite philosopher was Jesus Christ – and in office pushed to include more “faith-based” groups in the provision of social services.</p> <p>This year the Republican frontrunner, Ben Carson, has used his religious faith, which he also wears on his sleeve, to solidify support among evangelical voters. Indeed, their backing is one of the key reasons he leads in national polls of Republican voters.</p> <p>Presidents every year trek to the national prayer breakfast – a bipartisan gathering of Washington’s elite – to discuss the role of God and religion in their lives. Indeed, Carson’s decision to run for president can be dated to the breakfast at which he attacked President Barack Obama, thus earning the love of social conservatives.</p> <p>All this might seem strange – that in a country organised around the idea of separation of church and state such importance would be granted to the faith of the highest elected leader in the land.</p> <p>Indeed, it was not always like this. Fifty-five years ago, when Senator John F Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, ran for president he faced scrutiny over whether he could separate his religious affiliation – and allegiance to the Vatican – with the responsibilities of being president. Declaring “I am not the Catholic candidate for president, I am the Democratic party’s candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic,” Kennedy made it clear that the “kind of church I believe in... should be important only to me.”</p> <p>Suffice to say that this would be a tough position to take in the current political environment. But all of this is at pace with a larger inclusion of religion and faith in America’s political debates. Earlier this year, when a county clerk in Kentucky refused to provide marriage licences for a same-sex couple, several of the Republican nominees backed her stance – even after she went to prison for refusing to uphold her public responsibilities.</p> <p>Indeed, it is practically an article of faith among social conservatives that, in the wake of the supreme court’s decision legalising same-sex marriage, religious believers are being persecuted and are under attack. To be sure, this view is restricted to those of the Judeo-Christian faith. When Carson suggested several months ago that a Muslim should not become American president, there was nothing to be heard from many of his faith-based supporters.</p> <p>To be sure, there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with presidential candidates talking about their religious faith. America is, after all, a pretty religious country. The problem, however, is that God has become a political football. Republicans don’t just talk about their faith; they present themselves as the defenders thereof, against heathen liberals. Faith has become yet another dividing line between liberals and conservatives – and one that has exacerbated the country’s already growing and debilitating political polarisation.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is author of Live from the Campaign Trail: The Greatest Presidential Campaign Speeches of the 20th Century and How They Shaped Modern America</em>.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10958916","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403181","internalRevision":"38","publication":"The

She said: “Leave.EU claim to have Britain’s best interests at heart, but taxes pay for our schools and hospitals. The truth is that Britain is better off in Europe, which brings us jobs, growth and investment.”</p> <p>Leave.EU – whose official name on Companies House Records is Better for the Country Ltd – was incorporated in July by STM Fidecs, which was the sole shareholder until August. Ownership then passed to Banks, a former Tory donor who defected to Ukip, pledging £1m to Farage’s party.</p> <p>The father of five, who is worth around £100m, has been a director of 37 companies, three of which are dissolved and some of which are based in Gibraltar or the Isle of Man.</p> <p>Banks said those campaigning to keep Britain in the EU lacked his patriotism, adding that he had “nothing to hide”. He said: “Big deal, I am an international business man and I asked STM to set up the company for me, which they did. Better for the Country Ltd is registered in the UK and subject to tax etc, like any other UK-registered company.</p> <p>“It’s fully owned by me and I pay tax in the UK. To suggest I avoid tax is utter rubbish. I am a UK taxpayer and I choose to be, I have nothing to hide and have already published my cheque made payable to HMRC last year. For the ‘remain’ side to suggest I am unpatriotic is laughable, when they advocate daily UK taxpayers subsidising the EU project. I am much more patriotic than they are. I support Great Britain, they support the EU.” A spokesman added that Banks paid £1.8m in tax last year.</p> <p>The Leave campaign group’s other “ambassadors” include financier Jim Mellon, who made his £850m fortune by investing in emerging markets, including Russia. It has been reported that Mellon – who is resident on the Isle of Man, where the top rate of income tax is 20% and there is no capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp duty, death duty or inheritance tax – has donated up to £100,000 to Leave.EU.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Financial Times</em> in 2012, Mellon, who also has a home in Ibiza, boasted: “I might pay $1m or $2m for a painting that I really like – for instance, a painting from the 19th-century Grand Salon in Paris.” He added: “I regularly spend £100 on a bottle of red burgundy in a restaurant – and I don’t need a deal to celebrate.”</p> <p>Despite previously criticising corporations that aggressively avoid tax, Farage has also thrown his weight behind the campaign group. It is competing with the cross-party Vote Leave for official status.</p> <p>Farage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/farage-sideline-eu-exit-campaign-ukip-eurosceptics-cameron-europe\">told activists at Ukip’s party conference</a>: “As I see it at the moment, there is only one group that is absolutely clear what it stands for. Ukip will now stand hand in hand with Leave.EU. We will work together as a united force of Eurosceptic groups that want to leave the EU.”</p> <p>David Cameron is due to provide the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, with a letter spelling out the British government’s renegotiation terms on Tuesday.</p> <p>He has pledged to offer the British public an EU referendum by the end of 2017, by which time he wants to be able to tell voters that the country’s terms of membership have been improved.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10958057","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403191","internalRevision":"93","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Leave.EU, supported by Ukip and financed by a multimillionaire, vies to lead Britain’s exit from Europe","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Tax-avoidance Gibraltar firm behind anti-EU campaign group","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Daniel Boffey Policy Editor","commentable":"false","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T20:03:13Z","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446926508075/Leave.EU-backed-by-Nigel--001.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2f2","wordcount":"808","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446926508075/Leave.EU-backed-by-Nigel--001.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563df46de4b05e53c04d4c16","newspaperPageNumber":"5","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T20:03:18Z","standfirst":"<p>Leave.EU, supported by Ukip and financed by a multimillionaire, vies to lead Britain’s exit from Europe</p>","linkText":"Tax-avoidance Gibraltar firm behind anti-EU campaign group","creationDate":"2015-11-07T12:54:05Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-07T22:47:35Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458351669"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/07/referendum-farage-leave-eu","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/nov/07/referendum-farage-leave-eu","sectionName":"Politics","elements":[{"id":"c8715079a2d02c551ecd356136289a046c0f48f1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/11/7/1446926514573/Leave.EU-backed-by-Nigel--005.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Design Pics Inc / Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*29061365","suppliersReference":"1515913","altText":"Leave.EU, backed by Nigel Farage, was set up as a subsidiary of a Gibraltar-based firm by Arron Bank","caption":"Leave.EU, backed by Nigel Farage, was set up as a subsidiary of a Gibraltar-based firm by Arron Banks.

Personally I think it was high time we destroy Isis,” said one woman who gave her name as Tatiana Vladimirovna. She said she had worked in the aviation industry and thought negligence probably caused the crash.</p> <p>“Isis is horrible, they’re worse than Hitler,” said Natalya Petrovna.

Our planes have crashed before because the pilot was drunk,” he said.</p> <p>“Whether [perceptions] change will depend on our zombie-box,” he added, using a term for state TV popular among the opposition.</p> <p>On Saturday the Russian newspaper <em>Kommersant</em> quoted a source saying Egyptian forensic scientists had determined that several passengers died from “bomb blast trauma”.</p> <p>But, in general, Russian media remain hesitant to raise the spectre of a terrorist attack. State news agency RIA Novosti quoted an unnamed Russian official in the crash investigation as saying: “At the moment it is only possible to talk about the presence of undefined sounds registered by the flight recorder,” and that it was “premature” to say they came from an explosion.</p> <p>The official government newspaper, <em>Rossiyskaya Gazeta</em>, said the decoding of the black box did not provide conclusive data that an explosive device had been on board.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/07/russian-tourists-await-flights-at-sharm-el-sheikh-airport-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4e2fd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2403202\"            data-video-name=\"Russian tourists await flights at Sharm el-Sheikh airport – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-563dfb1ee4b09da63347fd33\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/07/151107Russian_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/07/151107Russian.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10930696&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/07/151107Russian_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/07/151107Russian_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>Russian tourists at Sharm el-Sheikh airport.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the days since the crash, Russian state media have largely avoided discussing the possibility of a bomb, instead focusing on the official line that any speculation before the end of the investigation is harmful.</p> <p>The British decision on Thursday to suspend flights to Egypt and David Cameron’s statement that an explosive device was “more likely than not” the cause of the crash have been met with scepticism and hostility by officials and media in Russia. </p> <p>One senator said the statement had been intended to put “psychological pressure” on Russia over its Syria operations.</p> <p>Even after Putin stopped Russian flights to Egypt over safety concerns on Friday, his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, insisted that this “does not mean that a terrorist attack is the main suspected cause of the catastrophe”. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/russia-condemns-charlie-hebdo-for-sinai-plane-crash-cartoons\">Russia condemns Charlie Hebdo for Sinai plane crash cartoons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>State-owned broadcaster Channel One quoted him as saying: “There are no clear indications in favour of this explanation.”</p> <p>The Russian tour operators’ association said on Saturday that 93 planes would be dispatched to Egypt this weekend to begin bringing back the 80,000 Russians now stranded there.</p> <p>Islamist groups have called for attacks on Russia since Putin began airstrikes at the end of September.

class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Britain has been training Chinese scientists in techniques that could replace the use of animals in cosmetic safety tests. </p> <p>The programme, which has been running for more than a year, is intended to lead to Chinese authorities banning all animal testing for toiletries, lipsticks, moisturisers and other beauty products.</p> <p>At present, it is a legal requirement in China for imported cosmetics to be tested on animals – mostly mice or rats, but also rabbits and guinea pigs. Britain banned the practice in 1998, while the European Union did so in 2013. Artificial skin cells are now used for safety tests.</p> <p>Products made in Europe have to be retested on animals in China – a major market for western firms – before they can be imported. As cosmetic companies and animal welfare groups have pointed out, this is a waste of time, money and animal life.</p> <p>China has started to investigate ways to replace animal testing and has sought the assistance of British scientists. The move is a part of the growing cooperation between the two countries that was formally agreed between David Cameron and China’s president, Xi Jinping, during a state visit to Britain last month.</p> <p>“We need to help the Chinese to get to a place where it is safe for them to stop using animals in testing,” said Judy MacArthur Clark of the Home Office’s animals in science regulation unit. </p> <p>“Their consumers have to know they will be safe to use cosmetics, even though they are no longer being tested on animals.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/18/animal-lives-wasted-in-drugs-safety-tests\">Scientists told to stop wasting animal lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, scientists from the unit helped set up an international conference on animal welfare in Beijing. This was followed up with a UK visit by Chinese researchers last December. Last week, MacArthur Clark and her team visited Beijing to help with training.</p> <p>“In future, there will be more cooperation and more help from us,” she said. “It is clear that the long-term aim of the Chinese is to change their legislation so that animals are no longer used to test the safety of cosmetics there. It will not take place overnight but I am confident it will happen.”</p> <p>A key motive behind China’s desire to stop animal testing lies with its growing affluence and the popularity of European cosmetics, such as those by Estée Lauder, Givenchy and Chanel, a point that was stressed by Chris Flower, director general of the UK <a href=\"http://www.ctpa.org.uk/\">Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association</a>. </p> <p>“There is a huge appetite for European cosmetics in China, thanks to [the country’s] growth in affluence. Cosmetics, moisturisers, sun preparations, you name it. If it comes from Europe, it must be great.”</p> <p>In total, about 300,000 animals are used for tests in China, MacArthur Clark said. “These creatures are usually anaesthetised and killed after the test is completed,” she added.</p> <p>European cosmetics companies have become uncomfortable with their products being tested on animals and, along with animal welfare groups, have been pressing for a halt. </p> <p>“Cosmetics firms and animal groups might not always have been on the same side, but we have been in this case,” said Nick Palmer of <a href=\"https://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/who-we-are/about-us\">Cruelty Free International</a>. “We all want a change. The image of shampoo being squirted into a rabbit’s eyes is no longer acceptable.”</p> <p>This point was backed by Flower. “Our companies feel uncomfortable about this because they can defend the safety of their products without doing tests on animals any more. It would also appear that the Chinese now agree.”</p> <p>In fact, the move by the Chinese away from animal tests is part of a growing global movement. “Brazil, Russia, Thailand, South Korea and several other nations have all made it clear that they plan to phase out animal testing for toiletries,” said Palmer. </p> <p>“Europe’s ban has echoed round the world. Countries realise, for free-trade reasons alone, they need to have a strategy on this issue.”</p> <p>In addition, the issue of animal welfare is becoming of wider concern, said MacArthur Clark. </p> <p>“Chinese society, as it becomes more westernised, is certainly becoming more focused on the care of animals. But people there need to be sure their cosmetics are safe to use.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10943831","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403077","internalRevision":"136","publication":"The

Has Tom Bradby’s new <em>News at Ten</em> hacked a chunk out of Huw Edwards’s BBC 10 o’clock figures as the ITV competitor soars towards 2 million a night? Or is the Broadcasting House version holding firm and doing “business as usual” – one claim from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/huwbbc/status/661511366537314305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" title=\"\">a chippy Huw tweet?</a> ITV <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/04/itv-bbc-news-at-ten-huw-edwards-tom-bradby\" title=\"\">groans over BBC “arrogance”</a>. Reach for a broad brush and a stiff whisky.</p> <p>The answer – possibly – is that Bradby’s recent arrival has added 240,000 viewers in his first few weeks, and skimmed maybe 200,000 of them from Huw. But these are smallish shifts in a permanently shifting landscape (much conditioned by what’s on for the hour before 10pm). It’s best to conclude merely that the Bradby makeover has made a decent start, with many missing millions yet to go and Robert Peston yet to come. Forget instant successes or failures. Consider, rather, what the Bradby arrival means.</p> <p>Peter Donaldson, “the quintessential voice of Radio 4” according to Director General Hall, died last week. He read the news, beautifully, clearly, authoritatively. He was a news reader. Bradby on screen is a news presenter in the US tradition of Cronkite or Brokaw. He offers you the news through the prism of his personality. He seems to have written every word of his script and to deliver it with cheery authority. This is the news from Tom Bradby seen through the eyes of Tom Bradby. Which is where the BBC has a problem.</p> <p>Bradby is a TV professional journalist and highly experienced political correspondent turned presenter. So is Edwards. They both did major election night-and-day stints. They both know their stuff. But BBC <em>mores</em> in that giant red newsroom don’t allow the news at 10 with Huw (or Sophie) to major on personality pitches. The presenter is one of a seemingly mighty team spanning the globe; he or she is the means of delivering BBC majesty, not the end in itself. In short, a reader.</p> <p>Meanwhile the surrounding newsroom churns away 24/7. It is a factory welcoming shift workers to sit at its desks and address various audiences seemingly interchangeably. Reporters present and presenters report. There can’t be an aura of personal authority here because the context swamps it. This show – from Huw to Fiona to Reeta to Clive and beyond – is always on the road.</p> <p>In many ways that’s a huge advantage for Edwards and corporate resources. It’s where 4.4 or so million viewers a night come from and go to. But every big plus has its downside. Rolling news needs to keep on rolling. The factory has to keep on churning. ITV has its individual styles and outlets. BBC News can’t do cosy individuality. And what on earth would be the (rumoured) point of deserting the outward-and-visible evidence of a £1bn Broadcasting House refurbishment in order to move flagship news to a pokier studio somewhere downstairs? Pharaohs leave pyramids for Croydon crematorium.</p> <p>Bradby fans weren’t the only ones bashing the BBC last week. There was Kevin Sutcliffe from Vice, appearing before a House of Lords committee and describing corporation news as “beige”, “formal”, “stuffy” and “constrained”. It’s like the NHS, wanting to cover everything for everyone, he said. It ought to hold truth to power rather more zealously. There was Dorothy Byrne from Channel 4 saying the BBC must be brave. “They must not be politically correct, looking over their shoulders worrying.”</p> <p>A trifle unfair? Yes, if you reckon that Vice, with its video edge and TV ambitions, is more of a youth-oriented magazine show than a news service. Yes, if you acknowledge that <em>C4 News</em> with Jon Snow and Cathy Newman has more of an ad hoc licence to take risks. And yes, if you tot up the BBC nominations for this year’s British Journalism Awards. But it’s not unfair if the accusation of beigeness, in that great red <em>Hunger Games</em> set of a room, is allowed to take hold. BBC News 24/7 means you’ve seen the bulk of the 10 o’clock stint already at five, six and seven – the vox pops and production numbers rewound in a static studio setting. It can all seem a bit old hat, while Bradby has a chance to ring the changes.</p> <p>And there is very little sensible to be done about it. Moving the BBC main news to 9pm to appease Mr Secretary Whittingdale makes things worse. Telling Huw to put on a sweater and a smile doesn’t help much either. Quitting the £1bn temple of news transmission is a shot in the foot. ITV is doing what its doing because it’s different, and competing via that difference. Trying to do a Bradby at the Beeb means mixing beige with yellow – and only makes the tough, feisty job holding truth to power harder.</p> <p>Risk-taking? Tough stories that need telling straight? That’s difficult at charter renewal time and doubly difficult with Whittingdale and sundry Conservative press lords leering over your shoulder. But it’s still the best way of painting yourself out of a corner in bold new primary colours.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10955151","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402811","internalRevision":"50","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"The social media spat between ITV and Huw Edwards is just one manifestation of the pressure BBC news is under during a highly politicised charter renewal","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"The News at Ten battle goes all the way up to eleven","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Peter Preston","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T09:00:03Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/618fd35e65705c736ab7f7f62d7d872d0495bbb6/3_0_4923_2954/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2xv","wordcount":"872","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/618fd35e65705c736ab7f7f62d7d872d0495bbb6/3_0_4923_2954/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563cbc79e4b0cfe9766d06e3","newspaperPageNumber":"45","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T09:00:03Z","standfirst":"The social media spat between ITV and Huw Edwards is just one manifestation of the pressure BBC news is under during a highly politicised charter renewal","linkText":"The News at Ten battle goes all the way up to eleven","creationDate":"2015-11-06T14:43:05Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-08T09:00:03Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458348210"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/08/news-at-ten-battle-up-to-eleven-bbc-itv","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/media/2015/nov/08/news-at-ten-battle-up-to-eleven-bbc-itv","sectionName":"Media","elements":[{"id":"618fd35e65705c736ab7f7f62d7d872d0495bbb6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/618fd35e65705c736ab7f7f62d7d872d0495bbb6/3_0_4923_2954/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2015 Rex Features.

It challenges the moral fabric of the societies we live in. To think, to be told, that your country can in some way isolate itself from the crisis is insane. It’s completely wrong.” Sutherland added: “Are we going to allow refugees to stand in freezing rivers at our borders this winter, to live in freezing tents with their children?”</p> <p>Speaking after the European Commission estimated that more than three million more people are expected to arrive in the EU by the end of next year and that those numbers are not expected to diminish until 2017, Sutherland said the EC had mechanisms to deal with the crisis, but that the humanitarian response had been woefully inadequate. “If the national debate is all around the negatives, keeping people out, then of course it’s going to be polarised and xenophobic,” he said. “This is not me having an Anglophobic rant. Right across Europe the evidence is that migration makes a positive contribution, not a negative one. Migrants contribute far more than they take out and they are necessary to keep a balance between retirees and workers.”</p> <p>Sutherland has been scathing of the language of “racism and xenophobia” used by David Cameron and other heads of state, criticising them for dismissing the plight of those they called “economic migrants”. But he said there was no longer any hiding place for leaders confronted with the issue. “This is a generational challenge for Europe. Earlier generations have had theirs, and have coped with them. We have to know that this is our moment,” he said. “Legally and morally, proximity should never define response. Why should people whose lives have been commendably saved in the Mediterranean become the responsibility of Italy? Why should Greece take all the responsibility because they are on the route? This is a distortion, this is a global responsibility, a European responsibility. Resettlement and relocation has to be part of the solution.”</p> <p>Sutherland said there was a lack of strong leadership: “Angela Merkel has provided enormous leadership; Sweden has provided enormous leadership. Then you compare to what others are doing and you see the chasm.</p> <p>“You can say problems are developing politically in Germany, which they are. But part of the reason there’s antagonism is the fact that the responsibility is not being fairly shared. It’s inevitable that people in Sweden, Germany and Denmark look around and think, ‘This is unfair’,” he said.</p> <p>This year 700,000 people have come to Europe looking for sanctuary or jobs. Britain has pledged to take in 4,000 a year from camps near Syria, a tiny number compared with German and Swedish offers. Sutherland said Europe was more than capable of absorbing a problem which is “less than 1% of our population”.</p> <p>“We have three alternatives. One, do we send them back? Two, do we leave them on the beaches or put them in insanitary camps getting bigger and bigger? Three, do we welcome them? There’s no way to dress this up. These are the questions and the moral answer is we take them in. You cannot solve this problem by building fences or moats.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959362","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403234","internalRevision":"63","publication":"The

Refugees and migrants arrive on the Greek Lesbos island after crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey on November 7, 2015. Nearly 500 people have died trying to cross the Aegean Sea from neighbouring Turkey this year, many of them in the narrow but treacherous stretch separating Lesbos from Turkey.

The main story in the NHS at present appears to be a standoff between Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, and junior doctors and the BMA on pay and working conditions. But the real story has far more to do with pace of the financial squeeze on the public sector to reduce the fiscal deficit by 2020-21. And this is a <em>political</em> choice.</p> <p>The NHS is used to an average real-terms growth of 4% per year. Since 2009-10, the figure has been cut to about 1% per annum – the most sustained period of parsimony since the <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/nhshistory/Pages/NHShistory1948.aspx\" title=\"\">NHS was formed in 1948</a>.</p> <p>With population rising, this has meant a real cut in per capita expenditure. Across the OECD, only Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, countries subject to IMF intervention, have had lower growth rates. And as a share of GDP, NHS and private spend on healthcare in the UK, at 8.5%, is low compared to most advanced countries in western Europe, averaging over 10%. The NHS is not only cheap, but is also under a tighter fiscal straitjacket than elsewhere.</p> <p>To be sure, spending on the NHS has been protected relative to deep cuts elsewhere. Funding for adult social care between 2009-10 and 2013-14 was cut by almost one-third in real terms. The impact is harsh – an estimated 400,000 fewer people are now eligible for support. Reduced payments by local authorities to social care providers are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/31/half-care-homes-could-close-cash-crisis\" title=\"\">pushing the sector to breaking</a> point. The impact on the NHS is increased demand for care because of lack of social support.</p> <p>The result is that 80% of NHS trusts are in deficit and, along with general practices, are under significant pressure. The NHS as a whole in England is facing an estimated £2bn shortfall by the end of the financial year on a £116bn revenue budget. Whereas in the past NHS hospitals may have cut corners on quality to balance the books, published information inspections and ratings of care by the <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Care Quality Commission</a> reduce the scope to do so.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tthe NHS can't shut down a loss-making plant, turn off unwanted demand, increase profit-making lines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are now signs of deteriorating access to care, particularly for mental health services, and waiting times for elective and emergency care are growing. Factor in a cold winter and a crisis is inevitable. The scale and extent of the deficits is so large as to be less a problem for individual providers and more a political problem.</p> <p>The government has committed to “increasing the NHS budget by a minimum of £8bn to 2020-21”. Given the fiscal straitjacket, it is hard to justify further increases since this would mean even deeper cuts elsewhere. And social care must be a priority for any extra investment announced in the forthcoming spending review. Relative to projected demands and costs of the NHS, this leaves a gap of £22bn by 2020-21.</p> <p>Faced with these pressures, the NHS does not have the same room for manoeuvre as a business. It cannot easily shut down a loss-making plant, turn off unwanted demand, increase profit-making lines. The NHS has social objectives as well as economic ones – to provide equal access to comprehensive care free at the point of need. That is the root of its strong support among the British people, consistently strong support that spills into the streets when services are threatened.</p> <p>The NHS is also far larger, more complex and riskier than almost any other enterprise in the UK, with 1.4 million highly educated staff, most of whom work on the shopfloor. And, as the current <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/tag/simon-stevens/\" title=\"\">chief of NHS England, Simon Stevens,</a> quipped to the health select committee about a report on NHS management by the former chief of M&amp;S, running the NHS is harder than selling underwear. Quick-fix solutions beloved (though not exclusively) by politicians are often simple, elegant… and wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77a3eda585e9abae49ac1a1f8e6b8032491e2239\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/77a3eda585e9abae49ac1a1f8e6b8032491e2239/1031_0_2275_2849/799.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt should be more cautious about demoralising junior doctors.\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Hunt should be more cautious about demoralising junior doctors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the short term, there are options. Pay is two-thirds of the total cost of the NHS and the government has already announced that public sector pay will rise just 1% a year in cash terms. This is below forecast inflation and below recent trends in private sector pay. Without careful management, there is a major risk of this leading to further increases in the number of dearer temporary and agency staff, although recent steps have been taken to cap the total agency bill per provider and maximum pay rate. The room to cut staff numbers is limited, especially with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/15/two-thirds-hospitals-substandard-care-care-quality-commission\" title=\"\">Care Quality Commission reporting 13% of hospitals inadequate on the safety front</a>, with staff levels a key factor. Holding down the national tariff that the NHS pays for services is another policy already pursued.</p> <p>Whether or not you agree with this government’s spending ambitions, in each of the past 20 years in all of the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6805\" title=\"\">EU-15 countries</a>, healthcare costs have outstripped GDP growth. The NHS is sustainable but the answer is to improve efficiency on a wide scale, which includes preventing ill health. Earlier this year in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/19/britain-uncovered-survey-attitudes-beliefs-britons-2015\" title=\"\">2015 British Social Attitudes survey</a>, 51% of the public reported seeing waste in the NHS. To meet the £22bn gap and if pay increases are held to 1% , the NHS will need efficiency growth of 2% a year in real terms. This is much higher than the long-term historic rate of 1% a year and substantially higher than the recent rate for acute hospitals of 0.4%.</p> <p>Achieving efficiency on this scale will be complicated and a long, hard grind. Superficial responses such as “more competition”, “game-changing technologies, “strong-arm management”, “fewer managers”and “more performance incentives” might sound good, but won’t do.</p> <p>Instead, a coherent approach developed with the staff at the front line, where efficiencies will largely be delivered, is crucial. There are some examples. The <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/futurenhs/nhs-five-year-forward-view-web-version/5yfv-exec-sum/\" title=\"\">Five Year Forward View, </a>published a year ago, is helping to develop new models of care involving preventing illness and dependency. Lord Carter is leading an initiative with hospitals using data to show where they could make savings from procurement to treatments, estimating £5bn potential savings.</p> <p>But these important initiatives look underpowered against the reality on the ground: overstretched staff with no support to make improvements; high turnover of senior management (average time on post for a hospital chief executive is 300 days); administration costs very low at 2.5%; no funds to invest for change; deficits too large to feel they can be acted on; public health a Cinderella service. Clearly, reducing the deficits to manageable proportions is an immediate priority, most likely through a “bung”, perhaps by raiding the capital budget. But more important in the medium term is a dedicated transformation fund for the NHS, argued for by both the Health Foundation and King’s Fund.</p> <p>Crucially, it is the clinical and managerial staff on the very front line of the NHS and the public who are most able to see what changes are needed, not policy-makers, and they need to be fully involved in finding solutions. The usual assumption in Whitehall is that NHS staff, especially front-line clinicians, won’t change and craft policies to make them. This is being played out in part in the current dispute with junior doctors, but there is plenty of motivation and talent to find solutions.</p> <p>A more effective approach would be to trust and support the staff and commit to mass engagement, rather than hope for a quick fix. Another reason why Jeremy Hunt should be more cautious about demoralising junior doctors.</p> <p><em>Dr Jennifer Dixon is chief executive of the Health Foundation</em></p> <h2>HEALTH SPECIAL</h2>","internalOctopusCode":"10959071","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403182","internalRevision":"88","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"The health service will be £22bn in the red by 2020 and only clinical staff-led efficiencies can save it","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"The NHS has social objectives as well as economic ones.

Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Before the election, George Osborne flirted with the idea of moving to the Foreign Office, a change of job that David Cameron would have granted to his friend had he insisted upon it. He ultimately concluded that staying put in the counting house better served his ambitions. The calculation was that his desire to be the next tenant of Number 10 was more likely to be advanced by maintaining his grip on the mighty tentacles of the Treasury rather than being the person put on the plane when the prime minister can’t be bothered.</p> <p>I wonder if he now has the occasional twinge of regret that he didn’t take the chance to make his escape. In just over a fortnight, he delivers his winter financial statement, a budget in all but name. This is a big moment. I’m not sure everyone has yet grasped just how big. The chancellor must not only release himself from the perilous snare he is in over tax credits; he will also be unveiling a spending squeeze of extraordinarily severe proportions. And he must somehow do both in a way that doesn’t so alarm or anger the voters that his backbenchers revolt and his reputation is shredded.</p> <p>Contemplating this challenge, one senior Tory goes so far as to predict: “If he doesn’t get it right, he’s dead.” It is fair to say that the author of that prediction is not one of Mr Osborne’s greatest fans. The chancellor will shrug off forecasts that this could be terminal for his ambitions. Previous rumours of his demise, notably after his 2012 omnishambles budget, proved to be exaggerated.</p> <p>The rollercoaster ride of this chancellor’s reputation tells us a lot about the fickleness of political fashion. Just a few months ago, when he unveiled his July budget to roars of delight from Tory MPs and a stunned silence from the Labour benches, he was being lauded by colleagues and much of the media as the master of the universe. What a clever fellow was George. He had dished Labour by raising the minimum wage and re-badging it as a living wage. He had shafted Boris, too. He was waxing so large that even the prime minister was in his shadow. Never had he looked more powerful. Nor more popular with this party. In Conservative Home’s regular poll of Tory activists that asks them to rate their leading politicians, he toppled Boris from the top slot.</p> <p>Since then, everyone has woken up to what the cuts to tax credits will do to the incomes of more than 3 million poorer workers and the chancellor’s claim to be the champion of the strivers. In the latest Conservative Home poll, he has taken a tumble. You may be amused to learn that this was brought to my attention by one of his cabinet colleagues. “George has fallen to eighth,” he remarked with ill-disguised relish.</p> <p>For the obverse of Osborne the Octopus’s great power is the commensurate resentment that it breeds in others. He has built a formidable network across government by promoting his favourites to influential positions and created a considerable powerbase. But it also means that he is not much liked by those who feel excluded from the magic circle. One minister who has enjoyed a rapid ascent under his patronage remarked to me recently: “There are many of my intake still sitting on the backbenches and they blame George for it.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His real problem with tax credits is that the chancellor has lost his majority in the Commons</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So there’s the personal bound up with the political in his dilemma over tax credits. It was the defiant vote in the Lords that compelled him to have a rethink, but the leaping lords are not the real source of his troubles. Since the <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-30/good-lords-for-democracy\" title=\"\">1909-10 clash over the People’s Budget</a> between David Lloyd George and the then entirely hereditary peers, a determined government has always ultimately prevailed over the unelected chamber.</p> <p>That is why all the blustering about a constitutional crisis was so much hot air. His real problem with tax credits is not that the Tories lack a majority in the Lords; his real problem is that the chancellor has lost his majority in the Commons. Ten days ago, Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the work and pensions select committee, tabled a motion demanding a pause to the “terrifying” cuts. That attracted the support of 20 Conservative MPs in the voting lobby. Not a single Tory backbencher who spoke in the preceding debate gave unqualified support to the chancellor. The size of the Tory mutiny would have been much larger had Mr Osborne not been very busy trying to buy off rebellious-minded Tory backbenchers with promises to favour their constituencies – do you need a bridge or a bypass? – and issuing general reassurances that he would fix the tax credit problem.</p> <p>Yet the more his options are examined, the trickier it looks. When I asked a person close to events what he thought Mr Osborne would do, he replied: “I literally don’t know. I don’t think he knows either.” One idea much discussed within the Treasury, and hinted at in the chancellor’s statements since his reversal in the Lords, is “transitional protection”: stretching out the implementation of the cuts to soften their immediate impact. But some members of the cabinet don’t like the sound of that. They fear that shifting the pain to later into the parliament would be no fix at all. “That could be worse,” says one minister. All sorts of other schemes for easing the blow to poorer workers are being floated, from imposing the cuts only on new claimants to making adjustments to tax bands to give additional compensation to the losers. But all these tweaks and fudges suffer the same handicap. They would still leave substantial numbers of people worse off.</p> <p>The chancellor’s calculations are further complicated because they have become entangled with the parallel battle he is fighting with cabinet colleagues over their departmental budgets. The primary purpose of the winter statement is supposed to be his announcement of where he will be squeezing public spending in the years up to 2020. The run-up to the event is being accompanied by a loud drum roll of protest from those who will face the brunt of the cuts. Chief constables are waving furious truncheons. The care sector is warning that further cuts to local government budgets, combined with the costs of implementing the living wage, will be a catastrophe for the elderly. Junior doctors are heading towards strike action and school budgets are feeling the pinch, an illustration of the mounting financial pressure even in areas such as the NHS that have some protection from the squeeze.</p> <p>On the non-protected departments, these cuts are going to be of a severity that is not yet fully appreciated either by the public or MPs. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that areas such as transport and policing are looking at overall cuts to their day-to-day spending of more than 25% by the end of this parliament, bringing the <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/bns/bn176.pdf\" title=\"\">total cuts since 2010 to more than 50%</a>. Cuts of that magnitude are without precedent.</p> <p>When I asked one member of the cabinet about the state of her negotiations with the Treasury, she gave me the sort of horrified grimace that you would have seen on the face of someone who witnessed the handiwork of Jack the Ripper. I asked another member of the cabinet whether the spending ministers were screaming blue murder. He laughed: “They are screaming every colour of murder.” Friends of Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran of many previous cage fights with the chancellor, are putting it about that he will resign if the budget for universal credit is raided.</p> <p>These battles with the spending ministers are a large part of the explanation for why the chancellor has been so stubborn about tax credits. He did not want colleagues to think he could be pushed into retreat because that would encourage the cabinet to resist him.</p> <p>It is this that prevents him from embracing the cleanest way out of his tax credit trouble. That would be to forget about trying to tweak this or fudge that. The simplest fire escape would be to abandon the cuts to tax credits altogether. That is the course being urged on him by thinktanks such as the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a> and influential voices like that of Frank Field. The MP for Birkenhead is not only regarded as a great sage on these issues, he is also the Labour parliamentarian most widely admired and respected by Tories. It would be sensible of the chancellor to open a channel of communication with Mr Field. I would not be entirely surprised to find that he has done so already.</p> <p>I’ve written previously that a chancellor can always find some money when he is in a real jam. This chancellor has U-turned before. And plenty of people have come forward with suggestions about where he could find savings to fund a retreat on tax credits. So why not? Because abandoning the cut altogether would be the mother of all U-turns. He will fear that it would involve such a colossal loss of face that his authority would be irretrievably corroded.</p> <p>The foundation of George Osborne’s reputation with his party is the belief that he is politically smart. He’s going to have to be very clever indeed to find his way out of this one.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959411","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403215","internalRevision":"71","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"The chancellor built his reputation on being politically smart.

shoppers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Britain’s retailers are hanging out the tinsel and looking forward to a bumper Christmas, with unemployment down, living standards finally climbing and house prices on the rise. But if everything is set fair for a festive blowout, why does the Bank of England still think it’s too soon to raise interest rates?</p> <p>Part of the answer is that, as governor Mark Carney made clear at his quarterly inflation report briefing last week, the shaky state of global economies, including China’s, means they have to balance the strength of domestic demand against over headwinds from overseas. But it’s more than that: the Bank is acutely conscious that the recovery remains fragile, unbalanced and vulnerable to external shocks.</p> <p>Four pieces of evidence. First, there has been precious little “deleveraging”, or unwinding of debt, among Britain’s households, many of which struggled to keep their heads above water in the lean years that followed the recession.</p> <p>Real wages have recently started to rise, and with luck they should continue to do so; but it will take a long time to unwind the after-effects of a protracted period during which consumers have turned to payday lenders in their droves, maxed out their credit cards and dipped deep into their overdrafts to make ends meet.</p> <p>As the Bank of England pointed out in its inflation report, the average household owes debts worth about 130% of a year’s income. That’s less alarming than the 150% peak before the crisis, but it still tells a story of fragility and stress: and it’s a key reason the Bank has so far fought shy of raising interest rates from emergency levels.</p> <p>Second, the sheer size and openness of our financial sector means we tend to catch a heavy dose of any market contagion going. The assets of the UK’s banking sector are worth four years’ GDP, with “non-bank financial institutions” such as insurers and fund managers worth as much again – making our financial sector far larger, relative to the rest of the economy, than any other major country bar Switzerland.</p> <p>As the Bank of England put it in its recent assessment of the economic impact of Brexit, “greater openness to the EU, like openness more generally, has probably increased the external challenges to UK monetary and financial stability, as seen in the recent euro-area crisis”. There is no reason to think that would be any less true in a future crisis, whatever form it takes.</p> <p>Third, bubbles are a sure sign of economic fragility, and the housing market, particularly in London, is well into frothy territory. Prices nationwide are increasing at an annual rate of 10%, and the average property in the capital is now worth almost eight times the average income.</p> <p>That has dire social consequences, as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/05/homebuyers-camp-out-overnight-for-chance-to-buy-affordable-flat\" title=\"\">grim tales of first-time buyers queuing around the block to secure an affordable flat in Hounslow </a>attest.</p> <p>But it has economic consequences too. Unaffordable housing silts up social mobility, exacerbates inequality and makes it hard for firms in expensive areas to hire the staff they need.</p> <p>But like any bubble, it is also inherently unstable, kept intact by cheap debt and confidence. Lower house prices would bring benefits; but an abrupt crash would be catastrophic, which is one of the reasons the Bank has so far used extreme caution in exercising its new “macroprudential” powers to rein in the market.</p> <p>And fourth, our current account deficit with the rest of the world – often seen as one of the best indicators of whether a country can pay its way – stood at 5.1% of GDP last year, the highest level since records began in 1948.</p> <p>The reasons are complicated: as well as the trade balance, the current account deficit includes the returns we make on overseas investments – which have declined recently – compared with the returns earned by foreign investors in Britain.</p> <p>One potential explanation for this shift could be large-scale tax avoidance showing up as investment offshore, rather than a fundamental deterioration in our ability to make good returns abroad. That would be an indicator of a global tax system gone mad rather than economic weakness.</p> <p>But there’s no easy way to explain away the stubborn persistence of the trade deficit, which was £8.5bn in the latest quarter and will continue to drag on economic growth.</p> <p>Much of this pattern is depressingly familiar. In some ways the credit crisis may have changed everything, but as long ago as 2002, Mark Carney’s predecessor-but-one, Eddie George, was already saying “a two-speed economy is better than a no-speed economy” – with a rampant services sector and buoyant consumer spending compensating for the weakness of manufacturing and trade.</p> <p>With luck, recent evidence that productivity is starting to pick up, validating rising wages, should continue to underpin living standards, helping to offset the impact of a fresh round of public spending cuts.</p> <p>But Carney and his colleagues are wise to be cautious. Gordon Brown’s catchphrase, “the economic fundamentals are sound”, soon looked absurd when the Lehman collapse exposed the lopsidedness of Britain’s economy. And as Catherine Colebrook, chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research, puts it: “Since the crisis, we haven’t done enough to change what we produce and how we produce; and on a fundamental level, we still have the same vulnerabilities that we had five or 10 years ago.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10951130","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403035","internalRevision":"46","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"The narrative of economic recovery seems to promise a seasonal retail bonanza.

If last week’s explosion on board a Russian Metrojet flight from Sharm el-Sheikh proves also to have been their work, those ambitions have reached a new level.</p> <p>Cairo has long struggled to control the sparsely populated expanses of the Sinai Peninsula, where Islamists have found refuge with smugglers, criminals and others keen to escape too much official scrutiny. But until little over a decade ago, it was a place militants went to hide, train and plot, not somewhere they carried out attacks.</p> <p>A shift in ideology, the fallout from a government crackdown, and chaos in neighbouring states have transformed the area from dangerous haven to conflict zone. Factions have united into a group with unprecedented access to funds and weapons, and which has become the most ambitious Isis franchise outside Syria or Iraq.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/egypt-plane-crash-tourists-can-stay-clear-unlike-those-living-with-terror\">Tourists can stay clear, unlike those living with terror | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is the group that claimed responsibility for downing Metrojet flight 9268 last Saturday, after it came down over the Sinai Peninsula with the loss of all lives on board. If it is confirmed that explosives were smuggled on board, it would be the first time since 2004 that a bomb has been used to down a jet. The last such attack was twin suicide bombings in 2004, also on Russian planes.</p> <p>“There is only one umbrella group, Wilayat Sinaa [Sinai Province]. It simply brought together every militant jihadist in Sinai and from across Egypt,” said Mohannad Sabry, author of the newly published <em>Sinai: Egypt’s Linchpin, Gaza’s Lifeline, Israel’s Nightmare</em>. “They all dissolved within the greater umbrella of Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which began operating in 2011 and pledged allegiance to Isis in 2014 to become recognised as the strongest branch of Islamic State outside of Syria and Iraq.”</p> <p>Membership has never been over 500 or 600, he said. “The highly sophisticated militarist elements do not exceed a few dozen members and are highly protected, the rest of the group are simply foot soldiers which the group sends to the frontline of its operations,” Sabry said.</p> <p>The group’s relatively small size belies its impact. A string of complex and deadly attacks on almost every possible target in the region – from government forces, international military observers and economic interests to a tourist bus – grabbed national and international attention. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/25/egypt-declares-state-of-emergency-in-sinai-after-checkpoint-bombing\">Suicide bombings of army checkpoints</a> last October and in January and July this year that killed dozens of people were the bloodiest peacetime attacks on the country’s military.</p> <p>The last one paved the way for the group to hold a small parcel of territory for the first time, cementing its allegiance to Isis ideology of governing as well as fighting.</p> <p>The 2014 downing of the military helicopter announced the group’s possession of advanced missiles, probably smuggled from Libya in the chaos that followed the collapse of Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, and intention to target aircraft.</p> <p>While man-portable air-defence systems (MPADs) cannot hit passenger jets at cruising altitude – ruling out a missile strike on the Metrojet plane – they are a real threat to any plane landing or taking off within range, which could include the Sharm el-Sheikh airport.</p> <p>Last year Sinai Province also signalled an expansion of its war from the northern heartlands of the insurgency to the tourist resorts of the south, with a bus bombing that killed three Korean Christians and their driver. Beyond Sinai, cells in mainland Egypt bombed police headquarters in Cairo and Mansoura, and tried to assassinate the interior minister.</p> <p>The deadly swath the group has cut through the area, and the brutal response of the Egyptian military, has brought some of Sinai’s problems to the attention of a wider audience. Its current crisis is rooted in part in unforgiving geography, its critical location at the heart of a troubled region. Captured by Israel in the six-day war of 1967, it was held by the country until the Camp David Accords paved the way for its return to Egypt.</p> <p>Hosni Mubarak presided over that transfer during the 1980s, and the growth of Sharm el-Sheikh as an international tourist resort and holiday destination for members of the Cairo elite, who accumulated villas along its beaches.</p> <p>Perhaps because of limits on the Egyptian military presence – under a deal monitored by international observers who still patrol the region – he did little to make its people feel part of the country, or give them any economic stake in its success.</p> <p>For decades their struggles with economic marginalisation and political repression were muffled by a virtual blackout on reporting from the region, or drowned out by heavy promotion of the sunshine and beaches of the southern coastal resorts.</p> <p>The traditional Bedouin inhabitants of the area have perhaps the longest list of grievances against the government, evicted from traditional lands to make way for government-backed settlers, excluded from deals to exploit natural resources like oil and gas, out-numbered in their old homes.</p> <p>There are no firm statistics available, but with the growth of tourism and other industries, they now make up less than half and perhaps even under a quarter of its half-million official residents, according to regional security expert Zack Gold.</p> <p>Traditional trade networks became smuggling routes, in part because of lack of other opportunities, driving a further wedge between the government and the Bedouin. In the 2011 revolution, they were among the first to rise up, and the fiercest fighters against the government.</p> <p>While mistrust of authority and well-protected smuggling routes made Sinai a welcoming base for those targeting Cairo, ensuring them some sympathy and local recruits, the Islamists in Sinai were never fighting a Bedouin revolt. “Tribal leaders do not encourage violent extremism and, indeed, the current Islamist insurgency challenges the Bedouin tribal structure and wellbeing,” Gold said.</p> <p>Particularly since joining Isis, Sinai Province fighters have stirred up resentment with heavy-handed attempts to control the local population. They have killed dozens as alleged spies, threatened tribal leaders who they believe oppose them, and tried to stop smuggling of cigarettes and marijuana because both are condemned as vices in their hardline interpretation of Islam.</p> <p>These attacks, and the indirect economic impact of attacks on both tourists and international military observers, the two main employers in the area, are eroding any residual sympathies residents might have for a group fighting the loathed government.</p> <p>“The Bedouin community has called on the Egyptian regime since 2011 to begin incorporating them in serious action against the militancy. Their calls were ignored,” Sabry said. “Numbers-wise, if the Bedouin community is leading an insurgency or backing the militants, this group would have thousands of fighters within its ranks – this hasn’t happened so far.”</p> <p>The Bedouin played inadvertent godfathers to the current insurgency through their smuggling tunnels to Gaza, though, linking Palestinian militants who crossed the border looking for freedom or refuge to Egyptian radicals hiding out in the area who they would later fund and train.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de2b27bba001c76e205d3c0bff445bb84d4b8c5f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/de2b27bba001c76e205d3c0bff445bb84d4b8c5f/0_149_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian solidiers captured by Israeli forces during the 1973 Yom Kippur war.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Egyptian solidiers captured by Israeli forces during the 1973 Yom Kippur war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“In the 1980s and 1990s, fighting was primarily in Cairo and Upper Egypt. Individuals would go to Sinai to train but not have much to do in terms of carrying out attacks,” Gold said. That changed when a terror group that would eventually provide members and inspiration for Sinai Province introduced suicide bombings to Sinai in 2004, launching the peninsula’s own battle with Islamic militants.</p> <p>Tawhid wal-Jihad, or Monotheism and Jihad, a group that shared its ideology and name with an early incarnation of al-Qaida in Iraq, launched its first suicide attack on the resort town of Taba, killing over 30 people. Another 88 died in car bombings in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005, and the year after that dozens more were killed when Dahab was hit.</p> <p>“Tawhid wal-Jihad focused its attacks on the tourist industry,” said Gold. “There were of course some battles here and there with security forces ... but what they are known for is the massive bombings at tourist resorts from 2004 to 2006.”</p> <p>With the vital tourism industry at risk from the string of regular, deadly attacks, the government cracked down hard. The group’s leaders were killed in police shootouts, and roundups sent many members to jail. The punitive, wide-ranging nature of the crackdown meant it swept up many ordinary people from the region, turning them against the government.</p> <p>Resentment of security forces mingled with the memory of the group’s impact through its bombings, so that even as it faded as a real threat, it came to serve as inspiration for a new generation of militants.</p> <p>“The former members of Tawhid wal-Jihad who led the attacks on Taba and Sharm in 2004 and 2005 also joined the ranks of Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis since its early days,” Sabry said. “One of them was the most lethal mastermind of ABM, Tawfiq Mohammed Freij.”</p> <p>Freij masterminded and personally commanded a cross-border attack on Israel in August 2011 in which eight Israelis were killed. The incident also stirred up major diplomatic tensions, because Israeli forces chased fighters back across the border and killed three Egyptian policemen in the pursuit. Freij was reported to have been killed by one of his own bombs last year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/observer-leader-global-terror-requires-global-response\">The Observer view on the jihadi threat | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group’s initial focus on Israel was reflected in its original name, which translated means “Supporters of Jerusalem”. Founders were probably trained in a Gazan militant camp, and leaders appear to have contacts across the border.</p> <p>Affiliation to Isis came after one of the commanders spent several months in Raqqa last year. It brought extra funds and weapons – reporting restrictions on the peninsula make it hard to assess how much – but also shifted the group’s priorities, Gold said.</p> <p>Its new international focus, determination to rule, and disregard for the local population could offer Cairo an opportunity to stamp out the insurgency by finding allies among the people of Sinai. To do that, though, it would need to drop punitive policies, like the mass destruction of civilian homes after Isis attacks, and increase economic and other opportunities for the people of Sinai.</p> <p>For now, Cairo is still pursuing control at any cost, rooting out militants with harsh reprisals and indiscriminate military operations that risk creating a new generation of insurgents. “Even if the government succeeds in putting an end to the attacks, it will never succeed in putting an end to the radical, extreme and revenge-seeking resentment,” Sabry said. “It is a seed that eventually, in many cases, grows into an armed terrorist or militant organisation.”</p> <h2><strong>Sinai’s troubled history</strong></h2> <p><strong>1967 </strong>Israel captures control of Sinai from Egypt in the six-day war.<br /></p> <p><strong>1973</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/06/what-1973-today-economic-crisis\">Yom Kippur war</a>.

At certain times in their careers both were considered supreme players on the world stage – Ronaldo holds the coveted Ballon d’Or, awarded to the player deemed to be the world’s best.</p> <p>Both were outsiders – Best from Belfast, Ronaldo from the Portuguese island of Madeira – from humble backgrounds who overcame youthful homesickness to flourish a long way from home. Both possess a combustible and often misunderstood combination of shyness and arrogance. Both had an alcoholic parent who died prematurely from the addiction. Both have been style icons as well as elite sportsmen, and both wore the No 7 shirt for United.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/oct/30/george-best-football-as-never-before-rerelease-video-extract\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4dmz6\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2398335\"            data-video-name=\"George Best: Football As Never Before re-release – video extract\"            data-video-provider=\"Hellmuth Costard, 1971\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56328c2ee4b0a78ad726bbf1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/29/151029Best_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/29/151029Best.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10911901&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/29/151029Best_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10911901&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/oct/30/george-best-football-as-never-before-rerelease-video-extract\">George Best: Football As Never Before</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But whereas Best quit the top rank of football in the prime of his career and drank himself into numerous arrests, imprisonment, a liver transplant and ultimately an early grave, Ronaldo, now 30, has been a model of sporting dedication and discipline.</p> <p>Best played at his peak in the late 1960s, a period of social upheaval, a burgeoning but still nascent consumer culture, and during the almost innocent beginning of celebrity culture – it might be argued that he was one of its first and most saddening casualties.</p> <p>Ronaldo flourishes at a time when football has become a global business phenomenon in which top players have become less sportsmen than international marketing brands. Best was arguably the first British footballer whose fame transcended the sport, and he arrived on the scene just as the game was beginning to pay players the kind of money that distanced them from their working-class roots.</p> <p>What’s more, Best, a beguilingly handsome young man with long hair and sparkling eyes, was lionised as a sex symbol and, perhaps as a consequence, was the first footballer to exploit his image rights for commercial gain. He promoted everything from sausages to shopping catalogues and had a £20,000 boot deal with Stylo. That kind of money made a big difference in the 1960s, but even allowing for inflation it’s loose change set against the £52m Ronaldo is said to earn in salary and endorsements.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/sep/28/cristiano-ronaldo-trailer-documentary-football-real-madrid-manchester-united\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4cne9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2379114\"            data-video-name=\"Ronaldo: watch the world exclusive trailer of the documentary about the celebrated footballer\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/9/28/1443438338870/KP_502731_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56091f0ce4b0f11a91dc7605\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/9/28/1443438338870/KP_502731_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/09/28/150928ronaldotrailer_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/09/28/150928ronaldotrailer_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/09/28/150928ronaldotrailer.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/09/28/150928ronaldotrailer_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/09/28/150928ronaldotrailer_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/sep/28/cristiano-ronaldo-trailer-documentary-football-real-madrid-manchester-united\">The trailer for Ronaldo</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As <em>Ronaldo</em> makes clear, life as globally famous footballer is spent inside a hi-spec goldfish bowl. In many ways it’s an empty film with endless scenes of Ronaldo alone, or with his young son Cristiano Ronaldo Jnr, at home in his huge and fabulously modernist house with shimmering swimming pool in Madrid. But it’s also a revealing one.</p> <p>He has very few friends, surrounding himself instead with a coterie of advisers, agents, managers and family members. He has sole custody of young Cristiano – he has never revealed the mother’s identity. We see him lifting weights in his home gym and doing press-ups and sit-ups with his son. It’s a very male set-up that seems to fit with the hard-bodied, ascetic, slightly homoerotic vision of himself that the footballer projects to the world.</p> <p>By contrast, Best, an often absent father, surrounded himself with women and, at a time before the phrase “sports science” penetrated football, was not one to leave a bar early. Although he possessed great natural speed, the main resistance work his body appeared to encounter was from lifting pints of beer.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2015/oct/30/george-best-football-as-never-before-rerelease-video-extract\"><em>Football As Never Before</em></a>, United win the match 2-0 with Best scoring one and making the other for Bobby Charlton. Best looks impossibly thin when set against the near-android physical perfection of the gym-honed Ronaldo. His thighs lack muscular definition and he holds himself more like a scrawny singer in a rock band than an athlete. Yet he oozes visual charisma and a perfectly balanced gracefulness. He was only 23 at the time, but his best years were already slipping away.</p> <p>Four years earlier, after a stunning performance in Lisbon, Best had been called the “Fifth Beatle” by the Portuguese press. He didn’t crave attention in the way Ronaldo, living in a time of celebrity-saturation, seems to do, but he made sure to enjoy the fringe benefits of his newfound fame. By the time of Costard’s film, Best was beginning to miss games as a result of his extracurricular activities; on one occasion he famously skipped a match so that he could spend a weekend with the actress Sinéad Cusack in Islington. There is a feature film in the pipeline based on that lost weekend.</p> <p>The Cusack episode caused a scandal at the time, but if Ronaldo ever tore himself away from the mirror to perform the same trick, there is a sense it would amount to an international incident with news crews from across the globe sent to the cover the story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9f55cd25d025358d2fe50ab0b5f2a88f0657c9e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d9f55cd25d025358d2fe50ab0b5f2a88f0657c9e/126_0_1236_1854/667.jpg\" alt=\"George Best and Susan George\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Best on holiday with the actress Susan George in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now the plaything of Russian oligarchs and Gulf royalty, every aspect of football – with the exception of its dubious economics – has come under intense scrutiny. A player’s statistics are crunched so that we know how many metres he has run, exactly what he has contributed to a game. There is no hiding place on the pitch and it’s hard to get away off it.</p> <p>Ronaldo comes across as relentlessly self-obsessed in the documentary, not least in his fixation on winning the Ballon d’Or, a title he has lost several times to his rival and arch-nemesis, Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. But perhaps, when the rest of the world is looking at you, taking such pleasure at looking at yourself is a necessary, or at least helpful, means of staying motivated.</p> <p>Best seemed to wilt under media attention and public expectation. As Jimmy Greaves, Best’s contemporary and himself an exceptionally gifted footballer and an alcoholic, once observed: “There are a lot of people that can’t carry the burden of being a genius, and I think George Best was a genius. George was a born, natural footballer … and I don’t think he could live with the situation within himself.”</p> <p>Best’s mother was an alcoholic who died of a related disease at 55. Ronaldo’s father was an alcoholic who died at 52 from a liver condition related to the addiction. His brother is a recovering alcoholic. But although we see him drinking a glass of celebratory champagne, it’s clear that Ronaldo worships at the shrine of his own body. Again, narcissism may have a positive role in self-preservation at the top.</p> <p>Best was not without vanity himself. Like Ronaldo, he could sometimes appear to play for himself rather than the team. He admitted once that he didn’t mind losing if he had turned in a good performance and he obviously savoured the adoration of the crowd.</p> <p>But the pressure of expectation, perhaps the lack of understanding back then of how corrosive fame could be, and generally more lax social attitudes towards alcohol, all conspired to undo him. And critically Best never saw money as an important sign of his status. To him it was just the means to a good time.</p> <p>For all the crassness, hyperbole and absurd wealth of today’s game, it also has some distinct advantages for elite players. They have become such vitally important commodities that it’s in the interest of so many around them to protect them from their excesses.</p> <p>The bejewelled, private-jet flying Ronaldo is, of course, a walking testament to excess. There is a telling scene in which he asks his son which of his many sports cars – Ferraris, Porsches – is missing from his car park that could serve a reasonable sized shopping centre. The answer is the Lamborghini.</p> <p>But these are material excesses – obscene, perhaps, but not lethal. Maybe Best could have been directed by teams of concerned advisers towards the consumption of luxury goods rather than pub booze had he been playing today. But watching him in his pomp, it’s hard not to conclude that what made him such a transfixing sight is that, for better or worse, he was always destined to go his own way.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10956297","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403025","internalRevision":"452","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"New documentaries highlight two footballing greats with similar backgrounds.

more evidence that robots are taking over from humans.</p> <p>C-3PO’s beeping buddy was part of a skit with Pinewood Studios chief executive Ivan Dunleavy. Other guests in 2014 included David Cameron as well as Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg (remember them?).</p> <p>This year’s roster for the business group’s event, which 1,000 bosses are expected to attend, includes representatives from long-established businesses as well as more disruptive forces, ranging from Tesco and Whitbread to Uber and Airbnb.</p> <p>Education secretary Nicky Morgan will be on a panel discussing youth unemployment and a surprise senior cabinet minister is also promised.</p> <p>No UK party leaders this time, however (unless the surprise turns out to be Cameron). Strangely the only media fuss surrounding these non-appearances was when Jeremy Corbyn reportedly cried off, prompting CBI mutterings of a snub by the Labour leader. “I am really disappointed he has not accepted my invitation to speak at the conference,” said CBI director-general John Cridland.</p> <p>Shame, really. Corbyn could have called his speech a new hope or – for more recent fans – the force awakens.</p> <h2>ITV aims to bounce back from rugby letdown</h2> <p>England’s early exit from the Rugby World Cup might still be painful for the country’s supporters to recall, but ITV investors will be hoping it does not scar the broadcaster’s results.</p> <p>Tuesday’s trading update should provide some answers, but analyst Ian Whittaker at Liberum remains positive. He said ITV had indicated that nine- month advertising revenue would grow by 6%, which implies around 8% for the third quarter. “The risk to this number is more on the upside than downside,” he said. “Previous discussions with media buyers suggested ITV had a strong September, helped by the Rugby World Cup [and England’s matches in the group stages] and comments from newspaper groups have suggested a relative improvement recently in advertising trends, which should be more pronounced in TV.”</p> <p>ITV should also have been boosted by the return of the <em>The X Factor</em> and <em>Downton Abbey,</em> as well as new successes such as <em>Unforgotten</em>.</p> <p>Any privatisation of Channel 4 – as hinted by the government – might allow free-to-air broadcasters to charge pay-TV companies for carrying their channels. More news was expected by Christmas, said Liberum.</p> <h2><strong>Sainsbury’s ready to come out fighting</strong></h2> <p>It seems like supermarket trading updates come around almost as often as new brand-match offers, and in the case of Sainsbury’s it’s pretty much true.</p> <p>It was only the end of September when the supermarket group pleased investors by saying full-year profits were likely to be better than expected after an improvement in sales and volumes in the second quarter. Come Wednesday and we get its half-year figures, with analysts now focusing on supermarket margins, which are expected to fall to 2.5%, according to Barclays. Half-year pre-tax profits could drop by 24% to £284m, the bank said.</p> <p>No surprise, really, given that competition in the sector is still fierce. Credit Suisse said: “Sainsbury’s stronghold in the south-east, particularly the greater London area, is coming under increasing threat. Recent statements from Lidl show the scale of their ambition, with plans to quadruple the numbers of stores within the M25, from 70 to 280.”</p> <p>Over the summer Sainsbury’s issued two bonds for £250m each, and half of the proceeds is expected to be injected into its pension fund. It is also selling its in-store pharmacy business for £125m in a deal that is expected to be completed in the second half. So it should have the funds for the battle.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10954362","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402992","internalRevision":"108","publication":"The

Hartwell/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>The crash of the Russian A321-200 Airbus in Sinai last Saturday, which killed all 224 people on board, is turning into one of the defining moments of the worldwide struggle against jihadi terrorism. Evidence that the plane was destroyed by an onboard bomb and not by a technical fault, pilot error or structural failure, is mounting by the day.</p> <p>French investigators say the aircraft’s black box<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/putin-suspends-russian-flights-to-egypt-after-sinai-plane-crash\" title=\"\"> recorded a sudden explosion</a>. US officials, referring to intercepts probably obtained by GCHQ’s Troodos listening post in Cyprus, say they overheard “chatter” between Islamic State terrorists in Sinai and Syria pointing to a bomb plot. American satellites <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/06/putin-suspends-russian-flights-to-egypt-after-sinai-plane-crash\" title=\"\">reportedly spotted a flash</a> at the moment the plane disappeared off radar screens. Russian complaints that Britain acted rashly by suggesting early last week that a bomb caused the disaster have faded amid repeated Isis boasts of responsibility. Vladimir Putin eventually followed David Cameron’s lead in suspending flights between Russia and Egypt while security was reviewed at Sharm el-Sheikh, where the plane took off, and other Egyptian airports. The US, similarly slow off the mark, has also tightened security.</p> <p>The fact that Russia and Egypt continue to cast doubt on suggestions the attack was mounted by the Isis affiliate in Sinai, known as Sinai Province, is both understandable and disingenuous. Putin knows that if he admits Isis did it, the Russian public will see it as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/05/sinai-plane-crash-putin-military-adventurism-syria-analysis\" title=\"\">pay-back for his recklessly provocative military intervention</a> in Syria last month – and may blame him personally for this and any future terror attacks. For this reason alone, Russian obfuscation may continue.</p> <p>The Egyptian authorities, from President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi down, likewise understand that irrefutable proof that terrorists penetrated security at Sharm el-Sheikh would be disastrous for the country’s reputation and vital tourism industry, so they persist in talking up less disturbing scenarios while claiming they have been kept in the dark.</p> <p>There are other signs of a continuing, face-saving reluctance to call a bomb a bomb. The White House, for example, fears an Isis success on this scale would highlight Barack Obama’s failed pledge to “degrade and destroy” the organisation.</p> <p>Worse still, confirmation that Isis blew up the plane would give the group an enormous boost, marking a watershed moment in the rapid evolution of a terror gang few had heard of 18 months ago. Until recently, Isis has been largely focused on consolidating a “caliphate” in northern Iraq and Syria. Its recruiting efforts have centred on drawing in foreign jihadis to defend this territory.</p> <p>In contrast, a big, off-base attack like that in Sinai would suggest Isis is pursuing wider ambitions and greater strategic and operational capabilities. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/05/isis-word-sinai-plane-crash-catastrophic\" title=\"\">If it did destroy the Russian plane</a>, it will have been responsible for the second deadliest terrorist attack since 9/11, the most deadly being the 2004 school massacre in Beslan in the Russian Caucasus by Chechen Islamist separatists that killed 385 people. This prospectively puts Isis in the same international terror league as al-Qaida.</p> <p>While al-Qaida and its leadership have been significantly degraded since 2001 by US attrition, Isis is led by its very own Osama bin Laden figure, the self-styled caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Known as the “invisible sheikh”, Baghdadi, unlike Bin Laden, has apparently survived several attempts to kill him. And while there have been numerous al-Qaida attempts to blow up civilian aircraft in midair, including a 2006 plot targeting aircraft flying from Britain to the US, none, apart from the 9/11 hijackings, has succeeded.</p> <p>Isis thus appears to have dramatically trumped its older rival, an achievement that can only increase its attraction to would-be jihadis across the Muslim sphere. Here lies the bigger, long-term danger arising from last week’s events. If Isis, working through an affiliate in Sinai, can cause such instant mayhem in Egypt, then what is to stop it attempting similar atrocities elsewhere in the world? The sobering truth is that this feared expansion is already under way.</p> <p>Israel is at obvious risk. Sinai Province, formerly known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem), reportedly comprises mostly indigenous Bedouin fighters but also Palestinian militants from Gaza. It has a history of attacks on Israeli targets. Further north, suicide bombings in Ankara that killed more than 100 people last month were attributed to Isis by Turkey’s president. To the south and west, the group has expanded into Libya, perpetrating trademark killings of Christians and other “unbelievers”. Few in Britain will have forgotten last June’s horrific <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3140454/Tourists-run-lives-Tunisian-beach-gunman-carries-attack-outside-hotel-packed-Britons.html\" title=\"\"> beach killings </a>by an Isis gunman in Sousse, Tunisia.</p> <p>The spreading Isis menace is not confined to the Middle East. Reports suggest a growing contest for status, recruits and influence in Afghanistan, pitting Isis against al-Qaida and the Taliban. A similar evolution is taking place in Bangladesh, one of the world’s most populous Muslim countries. A recent spate of random machete attacks on westerners has exacerbated worries about the murders of secular bloggers. Although Dhaka officials blame local Islamists, there are well-founded fears that Isis (as well as al-Qaida) is organising there, and among India’s large Muslim minority.</p> <p>The underlying causes of the expanding jihadi phenomenon have been well rehearsed, but western countries, Britain included, appear no closer to finding effective answers. The civil war or “fitna” within Islam between hardline Sunni and Shia Muslims, the chronic poverty and underdevelopment experienced by most Muslim countries, and the overall failure of the Arab spring to dislodge corrupt, authoritarian and undemocratic regimes, such as Sisi’s in Egypt, are all powerful triggers for revolt. Then there is the long, damaging – and unfinished – history of western interventionism in the Middle East.</p> <p>Isis has openly declared itself at war with Britain, its allies and now Russia, too. It must be rooted out or else more terrible outrages may follow. This may ultimately involve a truly international, UN-authorised combined military operation in Syria (in contrast to the Bush/Blair intervention in Iraq). It would see the west, Russia and the Arab powers joining together to suppress Isis, end the civil war and refugee crisis, and achieve a political settlement. An international menace requires a truly international response.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959350","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403218","internalRevision":"111","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"Only a truly international response can fight the growing threat posed by Isis","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"The Observer view on the jihadi threat","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Observer editorial","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T00:05:03Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a331dc854855a279c96f54198606b2d28020dc6/0_0_5760_3459/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2g2","wordcount":"1020","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/3a331dc854855a279c96f54198606b2d28020dc6/0_0_5760_3459/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563e1368e4b05e53c04d4c50","newspaperPageNumber":"36","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Only a truly international response can fight the growing threat posed by Isis</p>","linkText":"The Observer view on the jihadi threat | Observer editorial","creationDate":"2015-11-07T15:06:16Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-11T11:13:02Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458351858"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/observer-leader-global-terror-requires-global-response","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/observer-leader-global-terror-requires-global-response","sectionName":"Opinion","elements":[{"id":"3a331dc854855a279c96f54198606b2d28020dc6","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/3a331dc854855a279c96f54198606b2d28020dc6/0_0_5760_3459/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/3a331dc854855a279c96f54198606b2d28020dc6","suppliersReference":"TBH121","altText":"As evidence mounts of a terror attack, Egyptian soldiers guard the entrance to Sharm el-Sheikh international airport.

advanced nations such as Britain and the United States have failed to gain much ground over the past several decades and are under increasing economic stress is that globalisation and technological change have made most people less competitive. The tasks we used to perform can now be done more cheaply by lower-paid workers abroad or by computer-driven machines.</p> <p>The left’s standard solution has been an activist government that taxes the wealthy, invests the proceeds in excellent schools and in other means that people need to become more productive, and redistributes to those in need. These prescriptions have been opposed vigorously by those on the right, who believe the economy will function better for everyone if government is smaller, public debt is reduced and taxes and redistributions are curtailed.</p> <p>But the standard explanation, as well as the standard debate, overlooks the increasing concentration of political power in a corporate and financial elite that has been able to influence the rules by which the economy runs.</p> <p>And the interminable debate over the merits of the “free market” versus an activist government has diverted attention from how the market, both in Britain and in the United States, has come to be organised differently from the way it was half a century ago, why its current organisation is failing to deliver the widely shared prosperity it delivered then and what the basic rules of the market should be. This means that the fracture in politics will move from left to right to the anti-establishment versus establishment.</p> <p>The standard explanation cannot account for why the compensation packages of the top executives of big companies soared from an average of 20 times that of the typical worker 40 years ago to almost 300 times in the United States.</p> <p>Nor can the standard explanation account for the decline in wages of recent university graduates.</p> <p>To be sure, young people with university degrees have continued to do better than people without them. In 2013, Americans with four-year college degrees earned 98% more per hour on average than people without a university degree. But since 2000, the real average hourly wages of young university graduates have dropped. While a college education has become a prerequisite for joining the middle class, it is no longer a sure means for gaining ground once admitted to it. That’s largely because the middle class’s share of the total economic pie continues to shrink, while the share going to the top continues to grow.</p> <p>A deeper understanding of what has happened to incomes over the past 25 years requires an examination of changes in the organisation of the market, a transformation that has amounted to a pre-distribution upward. Intellectual property rights – patents, trademarks and copyrights – have been enlarged and extended, for example. This has created windfalls for pharmaceuticals, hi-tech, biotechnology and many entertainment companies, which now preserve their monopolies longer than ever. It has also meant high prices for average consumers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, certain corporations have gained enormous market power, including those owning network portals and platforms (Amazon, Facebook and Google); cable companies facing little or no broadband competition (Comcast, Time Warner, AT&amp;T, Verizon); and the largest banks. In the United States, financial laws and regulations instituted in the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/event/stock-market-crash-of-1929\">Great Crash of 1929</a> and the resulting Great Depression have been abandoned – restrictions on interstate banking, on the intermingling of investment and commercial banking and on banks becoming publicly held corporations, for example – thereby allowing the largest Wall Street banks to acquire unprecedented influence over the economy. The growth of the financial sector, in turn, spawned junk bond financing, hostile takeovers, private equity and “activist” investing and the notion that corporations exist solely to maximise shareholder value.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the wake of the junk-bond and takeover mania of the 1980s, economic risks were shifted from corporations to workers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bankruptcy laws have been loosened for large corporations, notably airlines and car manufacturers, allowing them to abrogate labour contracts, threaten closures unless they receive wage concessions and leave workers and communities stranded. Bankruptcy in the United States has not been extended to homeowners, who are burdened by mortgage debt and owe more on their homes than the homes are worth, or to graduates laden with student debt. Meanwhile, the largest banks and vehicle manufacturers were bailed out in the downturn of 2008–09, shifting the risks of economic failure on to the backs of average working people and taxpayers.</p> <p>In America, contract laws have been altered to require mandatory arbitration before private judges selected by big corporations. Securities laws have been relaxed to allow insider trading of confidential information. CEOs have used stock buybacks to boost share prices when they cash in their own stock options. Tax laws have created loopholes for the partners of hedge funds and private equity funds, special favours for the oil and gas industry, lower marginal income tax rates on the highest incomes and reduced estate taxes on great wealth. All these instances represent distributions upward – towards big corporations and financial firms and their executives and major shareholders – and away from average working people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, corporate executives and Wall Street managers and traders have done everything possible to prevent the wages of most workers from rising in tandem with productivity gains, in order that more of the gains go instead towards corporate profits. Public policies that emerged during the 1930s and the Second World War had placed most economic risks squarely on large corporations. But in the wake of the junk bond and takeover mania of the 1980s, economic risks were shifted to workers. Corporate executives did whatever they could to reduce payrolls: outsource abroad, install labour-replacing technologies and use part-time and contract workers.</p> <p>A new set of laws and regulations facilitated this transformation. Trade agreements, for example, encouraged companies to outsource jobs abroad, while enhancing protections for the intellectual property and financial assets of global corporations. Government budgets that prioritise debt reduction over job creation have undermined the bargaining power of average workers and translated into stagnant or declining wages. Some insecurity has been the result of shredded safety nets and disappearing workforce protections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7332e2585b47d402e11634f3a485a173aa4792f4\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7332e2585b47d402e11634f3a485a173aa4792f4/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Wall Street managers and traders have done everything possible to prevent the wages of most workers from rising in tandem with productivity gains.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Wall Street managers and traders have done everything possible to prevent the wages of most workers from rising in tandem with productivity gains.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, economic insecurity has been baked into employment. Full-time workers who had put in decades with a company have often found themselves without a job overnight – with no severance pay, no help finding another job and no health insurance. Today, nearly one in five working Americans is part-time. Many are consultants, freelancers and independent contractors. Two thirds are living paycheck to paycheck. And employment benefits have shrivelled. The portion of workers with any pension connected to their job has fallen from just over half in 1979 to less than 35% today.</p> <p>The prevailing insecurity is also a consequence of the demise of trade unions. Fifty years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker earned $35 an hour in today’s dollars. By 2014, America’s largest employer was Walmart and the typical entry-level Walmart worker earned about $9 an hour.</p> <p>This does not mean the typical GM employee half a century ago was “worth” four times what the typical Walmart employee in 2014 was worth. The GM worker was not better educated or motivated than the Walmart worker. The real difference was that GM workers 50 years ago had a strong union behind them that summoned the collective bargaining power of all carworkers to get a substantial share of company revenues for its members. And because more than a third of workers across America belonged to a trade union, the bargains those unions struck with employers raised the wages and benefits of non-unionised workers as well. Non-union firms knew they would be unionised if they did not come close to matching the union contracts. Today’s Walmart workers do not have a union to negotiate a better deal. They are on their own. And because fewer than 7% of today’s private-sector workers are unionised, most employers across America do not have to match union contracts. This puts unionised firms at a competitive disadvantage.</p> <p>Here again, public policies have enabled and encouraged this fundamental change. More states have adopted “right-to-work” laws. The National Labor Relations Board, understaffed and overburdened, has barely enforced collective bargaining. When workers have been harassed or fired for seeking to start a union, the board rewards them back pay, a mere slap on the wrist of corporations that have violated the law. The result has been a race to the bottom.</p> <p>Given these changes in the organisation of the market, it is not surprising that corporate profits have increased as a portion of the total United States economy, while wages have declined. Those whose income derives directly or indirectly from profits – corporate executives, Wall Street traders and shareholders – have done exceedingly well. Those dependent primarily on wages have not.</p> <p>Britain is not as far along the path toward oligarchic capitalism as is America, but it is following the same trail. Markets do not exist without rules. When large corporations, major banks and the very rich gain the most influence over the composition of those rules, markets invariably tilt in their direction – adding to their wealth and their political influence. Unaddressed and unstopped, the vicious cycle compounds itself.</p> <p>Yet the trend is not sustainable economically. The American economy cannot maintain positive momentum without the purchasing power of its vast middle class. This is one reason why today, six full years into an economic recovery, the US economy is barely back to where it was before it fell into the Great Recession.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dc440f6cb49a2ad435e31f14e9478de814cdac7\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6dc440f6cb49a2ad435e31f14e9478de814cdac7/0_0_4256_2553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Bernie Sanders represents a tradition of leftwing reform populism that seeks to limit the influence of big money on the political process.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Bernie Sanders represents a tradition of leftwing reform populism that seeks to limit the influence of big money on the political process.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zuma Wire/REX Shutterstock/2015 Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor is it sustainable politically. A large portion of the American electorate, working harder than ever but seeing no wage gains for years, is becoming angry and frustrated. That anger and frustration, in turn, is fuelling a populist revolt against the prevailing establishment. The revolt is already manifest in the presidential election of 2016 in the forms of Democratic candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/05/bernie-sanders-african-american-votes\">Bernie Sanders</a> and Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p> <p>But the two are quite different. Sanders represents a tradition of leftwing reform populism that seeks to limit the influence of big money on the political process, thereby clearing the way for the enactment of new laws and rules that can deliver more broadly shared prosperity. Trump comes out of a tradition of rightwing authoritarian populism that seeks a strongman who will take power away from the prevailing oligarchy and deliver it back to the people directly. Often accompanying authoritarian populism is making a scapegoat of vulnerable minorities, including immigrants.</p> <p>Both Britain and America have had brushes with authoritarian populism in the past. In the Depression decade of the 1930s, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/05/uk-fascism-oswald-mosley\">Oswald Mosley in Britain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/feb/02/far-right-glenn-beck\">Father Charles Coughlin in the United States</a> offered authoritarian solutions to the nations’ economic problems. But neither nation has succumbed. In times of economic stress, both Britain and the United States have opted instead for reform. President Franklin D Roosevelt arguably saved American capitalism from its own excesses, as did William Beveridge and the postwar Labour government, with regard to British capitalism.</p> <p>It is impossible to know when we will again reach a tipping point, but there can be little doubt it will come. Political economies that bestow most gains on small groups at the top are inherently unstable. The real question is not whether change will occur, but whether it will come through democratic reform or authoritarian mandate.</p> <p><em>Robert Reich is chancellor’s professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and was secretary of labour in the Clinton administration.

Or, for that matter, how the trendy Tietgenkollegiet student accommodation block in Copenhagen really ticks? Perhaps on a visit to the eccentric village of Portmeirion in Wales you have been unsettled by noises that slid out from between the buildings made famous by the 1960s television thriller <em>The Prisoner.</em></p> <p>Strange to say, but all these remote aural disturbances emanate from one place: the mind of the bloke from the Human League and Heaven 17. Martyn Ware, crown prince of the British synthesiser sound of the 1980s, has adopted the guise of an avant garde artist in his middle age. And this time there is no trace of subversive pretension, for there is nothing at all embarrassing, Ware argues, about being artistic – and Britain should wake up and realise that.</p> <p>“I find the world tries to make you feel guilty,” he said this weekend. “But anything artistic is undervalued in this country at the moment. The zeitgeist seems to dictate that artists should be grateful for any attention they get. Well, I just don’t buy that at all. It is really appalling and we are actually damaging our future prospects when people don’t support artistic endeavour.”</p> <p>On the north bank of the Thames in London this month stands a blue beach hut filled with memories of the British seaside. <em><a href=\"http://www.sightsoundandsea.co.uk/app/#/10/frame/2\">What Does the Sea Say?</a> </em>is a simple and effective repository of coastal sounds and recorded anecdotes and reflections collected by Ware. During the research stage, the hut was positioned at a trio of resorts and members of the public were invited to make vocal contributions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8ecb2dbf0ed2d7ca224d43d59e2739532947700\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e8ecb2dbf0ed2d7ca224d43d59e2739532947700/0_238_5616_3371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martyn Ware’s beach hut exhibition\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martyn Ware’s What Does the Sea Say? beach hut exhibition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, as part of an exhibition called <a href=\"http://www.sightsoundandsea.co.uk/\">One and All</a> at Somerset House, Ware’s beach hut on the River Terrace is proving a popular attraction. He and his collaborators in the show, the poet Owen Shears and the visual artist Tania Kovats, were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/01/national-trust-virtual-coastline-london-digital-exhibition\">asked by the National Trust to recreate a coastal experience as part of its Coast 2015 initiative</a>.</p> <p>And although Ware still regularly performs sell-out shows with his fellow Heaven 17 band members, he is happy to combine the life of a venerable, gigging pop star with his day job as a “sonic muralist”. He and his colleagues at <a href=\"http://illustriouscompany.co.uk\">his company, Illustrious,</a> spend their time “reshaping memories and defining landscapes” with surround-sound installations all over Britain and Europe. So far Illustrious projects have stretched as far afield as Miami and Mexico. It is becoming something of an international crusade for the musician.</p> <p>“The sense of place is the theme that runs through much of what I do,” Ware said. “All my artistic output is aimed at the general public, with as little elitism as possible and as little pre-knowledge as possible. It is necessary to enjoy them. I try not to make it too wordy, for instance.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvx4xM-ehM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIvx4xM-ehM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIvx4xM-ehM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Watch and listen to Martyn Ware’s sound sculpture What Does the Sea Say?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet, while his art is intended to be accessible to all, Ware has no problem defending the heightened aesthetics of his approach: “It sounds pretentious I know, but I want to maintain that creative attitude and to take it still further.” Artistic effort is now frequently viewed as a frippery, he believes, because too many people believe they can only find meaning in their lives by earning more money. “This means the artistic world is regarded as something quite nice to have – a bit like a nice car or wearing a nice suit – a luxury, but one which is not an essential part of the soul. I don’t want any part of that and that is one of the reasons why I am moving away from the commercial side of the sound work I do. I got sick of people in the corporate world having no imagination.”</p> <p>Ware, 59, now takes only those commissions that seem creatively worthwhile. Visitors to Liverpool this spring who wandered through the shopping centre will have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/24/liverpool-culture-festival-revival-historic-liners-one-magnificent-city\">heard the sound of transatlantic travel Ware constructed,</a> taking them on a journey from the docks to Manhattan and back. He regards it as a process of painting images in people’s minds with a palette of selected noise.</p> <p>Growing up in Sheffield, the young Ware befriended Glenn Gregory, later the lead singer of Heaven 17, and tried, without success, to get him to join his band, which combined electronics and pop music. Philip Oakey, a school friend of Ware’s, became the singer of the group which soon adopted the name the Human League.</p> <p>Oakey, who still performs with Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley, found success with the single Don’t You Want Me? as Ware left with keyboard player Ian Craig Marsh to set up a new band, Heaven 17.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"61ae937cfef7f86431f97625431ce3073da3b2de\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/61ae937cfef7f86431f97625431ce3073da3b2de/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martyn Ware, right, with fellow contributors to the National Trust’s One and All exhibition, Tania Kovats and Benjamin Wigley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martyn Ware, right, with fellow contributors to the National Trust’s One and All exhibition, Tania Kovats and Benjamin Wigley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Roberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ware became a record producer in 1986, working on highly lucrative albums including <em>Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby</em> and Tina Turner’s <em>Let’s Stay Together</em>.</p> <p>“From that period until around 1999 my name appeared as producer on 50 million records, but the work was getting to be more and more about new boy bands and I thought, ‘Even if I am successful with this stuff, then I am just going to be asked to do more’. Around then, as luck would have it, I fell in love with the notion of surround-sound when I was asked to be a consultant to the National Centre for Popular Music in Sheffield. They had the idea of a surround-sound auditorium.”</p> <p>From 2000 to the present day he has “carried on with Heaven 17 as a kind of a sidebar, with my real passion making immersive soundscapes”.</p> <p>Ware now lives in north London and has a studio in King’s Cross. Performances with Heaven 17 allow him to play music from an era which he regards as the last truly innovative heyday of British music. “There’s a lot of 80s-influenced sound around again, but I honestly think the late 70s and early 80s were a golden age. Britpop put up no contest.”</p> <p>He has, he says, loved each bit of his career and regards himself as lucky to have made enough money at times to survive, but not so much that he doesn’t have to work. “I am not that flush, but the impetus to try new things would not be quite the same if I didn’t need money. With a family I have got plenty of overheads, but that is all right as it keeps me wanting to take jobs. I can’t imagine anything worse than not working. I dread the day when I’m not capable of working. Maybe it is part of my Sheffield background and my dad coming from the steelworks. I love what I do and want to keep being useful as long as possible.”</p> <h2>MARTYN WARE: THE CHARTS AND THE ARTS</h2> <p>■ 1977: Sheffield-born Martyn Ware asks his charismatic friend Phil Oakey, a snappy dresser working as a hospital porter, to join his band making a new synthesised pop sound in the Human League.</p> <p>■ 1980: Ware leaves the band and Heaven 17, after much critical acclaim, finally chart with Temptation, a “song about sex”, in 1983.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7_Rc7m_smQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7_Rc7m_smQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7_Rc7m_smQ\">Listen to Temptation by Heaven 17</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>■ The 1980s see Ware produce a series of albums for singers including Terence Trent D’Arby and Tina Turner.<br /></p> <p>■ In the late 90s, Ware is asked to help create a surround-sound auditorium at Sheffield’s now defunct National Centre for Popular Music.<br /></p> <p>■ Ware goes on to develop soundscapes for international projects, including the Tales from the Bridge installation, an hour-long recorded loop of ambient electronic music merged with a spoken narrative about London, for the Cultural Olympiad in 2012.<br /></p>","internalOctopusCode":"10957831","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403102","internalRevision":"182","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"The synth star of the 80s wants to make avant garde art accessible to all – and says Britain shouldn’t be embarrassed about creativity","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"From Heaven 17 to sonic muralist: how Martyn Ware wants to redefine art","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Vanessa Thorpe","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T14:32:03Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/9122f9acd76fa4de85f400881ede4f56064a8964/0_1571_4560_2735/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2by","wordcount":"1266","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9122f9acd76fa4de85f400881ede4f56064a8964/0_1571_4560_2735/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563d1a5ee4b0ace666f8b8ad","newspaperPageNumber":"18","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T14:32:03Z","standfirst":"<p>The synth star of the 80s wants to make avant garde art accessible to all – and says Britain shouldn’t be embarrassed about creativity</p>","linkText":"From Heaven 17 to sonic muralist: how Martyn Ware wants to redefine art","creationDate":"2015-11-06T21:23:42Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-13T12:43:08Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458350940"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/07/martyn-ware-synth-star-to-sonic-muralist-heaven-17","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/2015/nov/07/martyn-ware-synth-star-to-sonic-muralist-heaven-17","sectionName":"Music","elements":[{"id":"9122f9acd76fa4de85f400881ede4f56064a8964","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/9122f9acd76fa4de85f400881ede4f56064a8964/0_1571_4560_2735/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 1982 Rex Features.

For when statesmen use the word “West”, it is never quite clear whether they are thinking of an alliance of democratic nations against the Communists or an alliance of white nations against the rest of the world. Still worse, there is sometimes a suspicion that they are not clear themselves.</p> <p>So when Field Marshal Montgomery calls for a triumvirate of Britain, France and the United States within Nato to direct “global policy”, and when General de Gaulle appears to echo this demand more formally, it is important first to ask exactly what they mean and what they are demanding.</p> <h2>Talking point</h2> <p>A bill providing for sweeping changes in the law of divorce is being prepared by the Marriage Law Reform Society.

The damage, though, is still sorely evident on Princes Street. As I observed in my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/31/edinburgh-world-heritage-status-in-peril-developers\" title=\"\">report last week</a>, the city’s planners are once more failing wretchedly to heed the lessons of the past.</p> <p>This really ought to be the most beguiling boulevard in Europe. On its northern side, the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghmuseums.org.uk/CMSTemplates/ScottMonumentVirtualTour/index.htm\" title=\"\">Scott Monument</a> sits amid rolling gardens in the shadow of a medieval castle. But when you turn to look at what’s facing it, you encounter a row of low, brick portable buildings, trying forlornly to be a retail thoroughfare. The effect is a curious one, as if a voluptuous society beauty has opened her mouth to smile at you, only to reveal a thin row of rotting teeth.</p> <p>The shops are housed in buildings flung up during a Modernist blitz in the mid-1960s, which tried to correct the civic vandalism of the Victorian era but only made matters worse. The demolition ball that began to wreck Princes Street finally met human resistance at the eastern end before it could turn the <a href=\"http://www.caferoyaledinburgh.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Café Royal</a> into rubble.</p> <p>Those protesters still living who lay down before the bulldozers are still favoured with the best seats whenever they walk through the doors of this Edinburgh institution. The wrecking spree was halted in its tracks, but not before the unlovely St James Centre shopping mall was flung up in 1973, a concrete excrescence that looms over the eastern approaches and disfigures what ought to be one of the most stunning vistas in Europe.</p> <p>At long last, work has begun to <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/new-plans-for-massive-850m-st-james-centre-revamp-1-3392025\" title=\"\">demolish and replace</a> the St James Centre, which takes Brutalism up a few notches and turns it into barbarism. Depressingly, the numpties and panjandrums who sit on Edinburgh city council have squandered the opportunity to heal the wounds of the past. The office and flat development is not without some merit, but its centrepiece, a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-31728877\" title=\"\">vast gold-plated hotel </a>that spins out of the concrete, is like the bastard child of Dr Martens and Christian Louboutin.</p> <p>What is it with this city, whose custodians, over centuries, seem to be ashamed of having so much natural beauty bestowed upon it and constantly seek ways to diminish it? When you stroll up Leith Walk you are affected by how magnificent this part of Edinburgh might be. There is a confluence of vistas that ought to take your breath away: to the north, the views across the Forth; to the west, the Scott Monument and the terraces of the Old Town, with the Castle. Due east is <a href=\"http://www.edinburghguide.com/parks/caltonhill\" title=\"\">Calton Hill</a>, which, with its monuments, observatory and neoclassical High School, inspired the name the Athens of the North: at least, that’s where it is if you could see it from here. For the view has been obliterated by yet more office blocks in that concrete and chrome fusion so beloved of the city’s guardians. This part of Edinburgh ought to be magnificent; instead, it is tawdry.</p> <p>The fate of the Old Royal High School, one of the most important buildings in Britain, is also now at the mercy of the men and women who waved through the St James development. Plans to turn it into <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/royal-high-school-luxury-hotel-plans-unveiled-1-3875798#axzz3qix8qbEB\" title=\"\">another hotel</a> for the elite, complete with two free-standing accommodation blocks, give it the appearance of Mickey Mouse’s head. This school, remember, was built by Thomas Hamilton and is considered to be one of the finest neoclassical Greek buildings constructed in the post-Hellenic period. It is one of the crown jewels of Scotland’s built heritage.</p> <p>Those who are expressing deep concerns about which way Edinburgh city council will jump are not holding their breath. They cite the fate of St Andrew Square on the east end of George Street, within muffin-throwing distance of the St James Centre, as evidence. Last year, three listed buildings, including fine Victorian and Edwardian abodes, <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/75m-st-andrew-square-scheme-to-go-ahead-1-3320381#axzz3qix8qbEB\" title=\"\">were bulldozed</a> to make way for one of those featureless and sanitised garden projects.</p> <p>Despite the charging wildebeest approach to civic development that has disfigured Edinburgh’s architectural heritage, there was still enough beauty for the city to be made a Unesco world heritage site in 1995, principally for the splendour of its medieval Old Town and Georgian New Town. Yet, as I reported last week, that honour is under threat following the havoc that’s being wreaked in Edinburgh’s loveliest spaces.</p> <p>There is a view that holds that these things don’t really matter. This was espoused earlier this year by a chap called Richard Williams, an academic who specialises in a discipline that calls itself “contemporary visual cultures”. Williams described critics of these building developments as “neurotic” and <a href=\"http://richardjwilliams.net/category/architecture-2/\" title=\"\">suggested that most tourists visit Edinburgh</a> during its festival for standup comedians rather than architecture.</p> <p>This academic’s remarks inadvertently demonstrate why Scotland’s built heritage is of great social value to its people. They characterise an elitist and “top down” attitude of the type that says: “The little people don’t really have the wherewithal to appreciate beauty and splendour, so why bother? Let’s give them whizzes and bangs instead.”</p> <p>People like me, a persistent and envious Glaswegian, do like to attend the comedy shows at the Edinburgh festival, but we wouldn’t pay to watch them if they were in Milton Keynes or Birmingham. What makes Edinburgh beautiful are things that money can’t buy. You don’t even need to know what is medieval and what is Georgian and what is neoclassical Greek to appreciate that you are in the presence of something sacred and beautiful.</p> <p>Nor was this a casual and random thing, some happy accident of birth. These buildings were bequeathed to this country by its brightest and best, to express their love for Edinburgh and as a free gift for generations to come. Governments can impoverish their citizens by choosing to pander to rich people, but beauty that doesn’t require money to be appreciated ought to be out of their reach, shouldn’t it?</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10955926","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2402918","internalRevision":"33","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"The city’s great buildings were created by people who loved the city.

Red light areas outside major stations are a particular concern, said McCullough.</p> <p>Station staff will be asked to look for signs that a child may be vulnerable, such as loitering for a long time on their own or wearing school uniform at the weekend.</p> <p>Louise Ellman, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside and chair of the Commons transport select committee, said the safety of children in stations had been neglected.</p> <p>“Stations are places where vulnerable young people often congregate,” she said.</p> <p>“They may be running away from their homes or it may simply be a place where they meet others. Often the perception is that the young people involved could be a source of trouble, when in reality they are overwhelmingly vulnerable young people who need help.”</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmtran/428/42807.htm#a9\">report published last year</a> by the transport select committee recommended that BTP should be brought in line with other police forces, which set targets to assess how well they support vulnerable children. </p> <p>Railway Children is now working with BTP, operating companies and charities to ensure incidents are reported and that more emergency accommodation is made available for 16- and 17-year-olds.</p> <p>Paul Crowther, chief constable of BTP, said train staff would play a crucial role in reporting unusual behaviour.</p> <p>“They can be our eyes and ears as they go about their day-to-day work by providing us with the information we need to recognise signs of vulnerability or potential exploitation.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959530","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403235","internalRevision":"102","publication":"The

Just 5.1% of energy used in the UK is renewable, according to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7057270/8-04112015-BP-EN.pdf/a233ec9d-f87d-4f48-8f1c-4d0a1a2eb112\">figures produced by the EU statistical office</a>.</p> <p>The government has a target of 15% of energy consumption from renewables by 2020, but its record so far leaves it to make the largest improvement of all 28 member states.</p> <p>Responding to the figures, Deben said that, while the government had had some reasonable success in the production of renewable power, in particular from offshore wind turbines, the statistics laid bare the striking failings in government policy.</p> <p>In July ministers abolished the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/uk-ceases-financing-of-green-deal\">failed green deal</a>, which subsidised the insulation of homes, in favour of an as yet unspecified “new value-for-money approach”. It also announced that the zero-carbon standard for new homes would not go ahead, replaced only by a commitment to “keep energy efficiency standards under review”.</p> <p>Deben said that where policies failed it was right to abandon them, but that alternative plans needed to emerge urgently if progress was to be made on the government’s publicly stated aspirations.</p> <p>“In terms of heat, clearly we are failing,” he said. “It is much the most difficult thing. This is the area we have to get right. We need a mixture of renewable heat initiatives and energy efficiency. You have to get these two together. This is the area we have so far failed in. There is an awful lot of heat going to waste.</p> <p>“The government admits that the things it has tried have not worked sufficiently. The climate change committee has brought it to their notice and the government is working on trying to produce a different way of achieving this end. There is nothing wrong with failing, but what we have to do is keep our absolute eye on the outcomes.”</p> <p>The former environment secretary said he was also concerned that a stream of recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/07/solar-schools-project-threatened-by-renewable-energy-cuts\">cutbacks to subsidies for solar</a> and onshore wind power generation had hit the confidence of those who might be willing to invest in green technology.</p> <p>Solar subsidies have been reduced by 87% and tax relief for community clean energy projects removed, leading to the closure of a stream of businesses and potential projects which were unable to find a way to be economically viable.</p> <p>The onshore wind power industry has also voiced concerns that the government may be looking to sideline the sector. Mike Parker, head of onshore energy at RWE Innogy UK, said his company was holding back on updating eight turbine sites, which could otherwise produce enough energy to power 55,000 homes.</p> <p>Deben said he recognised the need to ensure that the government’s £7.6bn budget for the renewables sector between 2015 and 2020 was not overshot. He added that success in the production of power from offshore wind, and the costs to the government that came with paying for the unexpectedly large energy supply from that sector, had made cuts in other areas understandable.However, the Conservative peer added that it was up to ministers to urgently deal with the growing feeling in the sector that the government had lost sight of the importance of having a diverse range of renewable energy sources.</p> <p>“The government hasn’t got it right because there is a lack of certainty and confidence,” he said. “It has a duty to keep spending to budget. But there is an urgency in them saying what they are now going to do.”</p> <p>Responding to Deben’s comments, shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called for the government to rethink its cuts. She said: “As a result of this government’s recent raft of decisions to roll back solar and wind programmes and to instead direct subsidies towards more expensive energy technologies, Britain’s global standing and ambitions to reach our climate change and renewable targets will be severely damaged.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said: “These are out-of-date figures based on DECC’s estimate for 2013 made in 2014. We are making good progress towards the 2020 renewables target of 15% of final energy consumption from renewable sources, and have exceeded the latest interim target of 5.4%.”</p> <h2>ENERGY SWITCHES</h2> <p><strong>PRIVATISED Green Investment Bank</strong></p> <p>Ministers are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/campaigners-alarmed-plans-sell-stake-green-investment-bank\">currently seeking to sell off the bank</a> and abolish the rules that would ensure all its investment was in green technologies.</p> <p><strong>SCRAPPED Zero-carbon homes</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/uk-scraps-zero-carbon-home-target\">New dwellings from 2016 will not have to generate as much energy on site through renewable sources</a>, such as wind or solar power, as they would use in heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation.</p> <p><strong>CUT Solar subsidies</strong></p> <p>Subsidies have been cut by 87% and tax relief for community clean energy projects removed.</p> <p><strong>CUT Onshore windfarm subsidies</strong></p> <p>New windfarms will not receive subsidies after 2016.</p> <p><strong>TAXED Renewables</strong></p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/green-energy-sector-attacks-budget-climate-change-levy\">£910m-a-year raid</a> has been made on the renewable energy sector by changing a climate change levy.</p> <p><strong>TAXED Low-emission cars</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-osborne-unveils-green-car-tax-overhaul-to-fund-roadbuilding\">Tax exemptions for low-emission cars have been removed</a>, with all the proceeds going back into road building and maintenance.</p> <p><strong>SUBSIDISED Diesel and coal</strong></p> <p>Cash is being thrown at fossil fuel industries amid an energy shortage.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10958737","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403205","internalRevision":"61","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"John Gummer, ex-Tory minister, says government must win back confidence of investors in renewable energy","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"You’re failing on green energy, Tory ex-minister warns Cameron","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Daniel Boffey","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T15:54:57Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf/0_0_3361_2017/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2fg","wordcount":"1006","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf/0_0_3361_2017/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563e0034e4b05e53c04d4c28","newspaperPageNumber":"8","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-10T15:54:57Z","standfirst":"John Gummer, PM’s climate change adviser, fears impact of subsidy cuts to solar and wind power","linkText":"You’re failing on green energy, Tory ex-minister warns Cameron","creationDate":"2015-11-07T13:44:20Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-09T11:07:48Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458351769"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/07/tory-green-energy-policy-failing-david-cameron--john-gummer","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/07/tory-green-energy-policy-failing-david-cameron--john-gummer","sectionName":"Environment","elements":[{"id":"aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf/0_0_3361_2017/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf","suppliersReference":"SCOTLAND_Windfarm_081837.JPG","altText":"A wind farm in Scotland.

It was only in June that we were horrified by 38 dead in a beach hotel in Sousse, Tunisia. Now the black box from the downed Russian tourist jet, with its reported recording of an explosion, seems to confirm the findings of British and American intelligence: that a terrorist bomb destroyed the plane 23 minutes after it took off from Sharm el-Sheikh airport. Up to 20,000 British holidaymakers are in limbo as flights home are suspended.</p> <p>It is part of a litany of dreadful incidents. Recall the acid attacks on women tourists in Zanzibar or the terror that engulfed Nairobi’s Westgate shopping mall. Yet the magnitude of this latest crime suggests a tipping point. Islamist terrorism, with its horrifying images of beheaded hostages, or indiscriminate killing everywhere from Nigeria to Syria, is no longer something sadly to shake your head over as the TV pictures speed by.</p> <p>The mounting wave of violence, and the perpetrators’ barbaric indifference to the deaths of innocents, is beginning to change our mental map of the world. Be careful as a westerner where you go for that winter suntan or exotic diving trip. The wrong choice could cost you, if not your life, then a considerable amount of time and money. It is a mood of closure that, however understandable, has dangerous ramifications.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/08/sinai-magnet-for-terror\">How Sinai became a magnet for terror</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the facts speak. There is a lengthening list of destinations to which western governments advise us not to travel. Flights to Libya, Somalia, Iraq, Crimea and eastern Ukraine, among other countries, are prohibited by the Americans, while there are restrictions to Mali, southern Sudan, Kenya, Congo, Iran and Afghanistan. Now add Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh to the list.</p> <p>A growing and vast arc of the world’s territory from North Africa through the Middle East to Iran and Afghanistan is becoming off-limits – you travel there at your peril. It may be true that the probability of being a victim of terrorism is low and that the vast majority of the hundreds of millions of Muslims living in these countries are as horrified by the capture of their religion by crazed zealots as we in the west are. But who would voluntarily now holiday in Tunisia, Sharm el-Sheikh or Zanzibar – or even spend time in the Middle East if it could be avoided?</p> <p>There is a progressive erosion of trust. Airport security is one obvious flashpoint. In countries where the rule of law is insecure, transparency minimal and democratic accountability non-existent, can a western traveller be confident that the security checks are uncompromised? Equally, you could be forgiven for asking whether you can trust the apparently friendly tour guide, beach attendant or restaurateur. Any one of them could be tempted by the vast ransom money offered by groups such as Isis for western hostages.</p> <p>Nor is it just western tourists beginning to vote with their feet. The inhabitants of the worst affected countries are fleeing the mayhem, inducing the greatest humanitarian challenge in Europe since the second world war.</p> <p>Herein is the risk. The tourists’ instinct simply to stay clear, compounded by the mind-boggling scale of the refugee crisis, is closing down the options of our governments. The causes of the terrorism seem so intractable that to engage with the issue is to invite defeat and so inflict political damage on those who try. Instead there is a hunkering down – increasing the temptation to close borders – and a growing readiness to set aside the principles of liberty and permit mass surveillance. Witness last week’s investigatory powers bill.</p> <p>But engage we must. Apart from the amorality of standing aside while hundreds of millions of people plunge ever deeper into violence and isolation, there is our own self-interest to consider. Already we have a refugee crisis, but there is worse ahead. Without change, the risk grows that a dirty nuclear device will be exploded in a western capital in the next 10 to 15 years.</p> <p>The starting point for a response must be twofold, as Karen Armstrong argues in her powerful new book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/08/fields-of-blood-religion-history-violence-karen-armstrong-review\"><em>Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence</em></a>. First, it is crucial to recognise there is nothing inherent in Islam that disposes it to mindless barbaric violence. Indeed, she notes that one of the characteristics of many jihadi terrorists is that they have not been brought up as “proper” Muslims; they are people from the margins of society who have no real understanding of the religion in whose name they act.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/observer-leader-global-terror-requires-global-response\">The Observer view on the jihadi threat | Observer editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, terrorism is fuelled by poverty and injustice. Economist Paul Collier has identified 50 countries in which a billion people live with either stagnating or falling incomes: it is no accident that so many are recruiting sergeants for Islamist terrorism. In <em>The</em> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/10/politics\"><em>Bottom Billion</em></a>, Collier calls for a multi-pronged assault to generate economic development – creating functioning, rule-of-law, accountable states, giving preferential export access to western markets, focusing development aid on the poorest and using western force, if necessary, to impose peace.<br /></p> <p>Too much conflict and terrorism, he wrote before Syria and Libya unravelled to prove his point, is the result of a vicious circle of violence begetting violence. In response, western governments have to build states, create peace and simulate the kind of smart interdependence between the private and public sectors that has underpinned every development miracle – from postwar Europe to Asia today. Yet such compassionate hard-headedness – that is neither wildly free market nor statist – seems beyond us.</p> <p>To its credit, the Cameron government has sustained the aid budget, but it is hardly spent with the imagination or energy Collier demands. But then, neither is anybody else’s. With the EU commission forecasting that <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/migrant-crisis-eu-3-million-migrants-news-2017-finance/\">3 million migrants will arrive in Europe by 2017</a> while Islamist terrorism continues its upsurge, what Europe really should be talking about is a monumental aid, trade and state-building plan for the Middle East – along with an insistence that Israel start doing something – rather than simply talking about peace.</p> <p>Nor can Britain escape these dilemmas if it leaves the EU. Engagement with terrorism, engagement with the poverty of the bottom billion and engagement with Europe as an instrument of collective response are all interlinked. The core Eurosceptic propositions – that Britain is best off alone and that all things European are bad – has moved from being irritatingly xenophobic to positively dangerous.</p> <p>Of course engagement might not work as well as it needs to. But disengagement, for all its temptations, is guaranteed to fail. The tragedy is that what should be an easy choice has become so very, very difficult. Terrorism must not be allowed such a victory.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10959434","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403248","internalRevision":"60","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"As Egypt joins the list of places off limits, we Europeans must be careful not to disengage with the Muslim world","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Tourists can stay clear, unlike those living with terror","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Will Hutton","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T00:05:04Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f210ac66ee74263dadcc84ccf3e4a59ccbf20db1/0_0_3500_2102/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2h5","wordcount":"1104","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f210ac66ee74263dadcc84ccf3e4a59ccbf20db1/0_0_3500_2102/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563e289ae4b05e53c04d4ca4","newspaperPageNumber":"38","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>As Egypt joins the list of places off limits, we Europeans must be careful not to disengage with the Muslim world</p>","linkText":"Tourists can stay clear, unlike those living with terror | Will Hutton","creationDate":"2015-11-07T16:36:42Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-09T08:47:02Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458352115"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/egypt-plane-crash-tourists-can-stay-clear-unlike-those-living-with-terror","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/egypt-plane-crash-tourists-can-stay-clear-unlike-those-living-with-terror","sectionName":"Opinion","elements":[{"id":"f210ac66ee74263dadcc84ccf3e4a59ccbf20db1","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f210ac66ee74263dadcc84ccf3e4a59ccbf20db1/0_0_3500_2102/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/f210ac66ee74263dadcc84ccf3e4a59ccbf20db1","suppliersReference":"POLITICS_Tunisia_064631.JPG","altText":"Flowers on the beach in Sousse, Tunisia, where 38 people lost their lives in June.

</figure>","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>Just as the French political elite is overwhelmingly educated at the École nationale d’administration, so their English counterparts are overwhelming educated at Oxford University. There the similarity once stopped.</p> <p>France has more than its fair share of conspiracy theorists, but you didn’t have to join them to worry about the tight circle of <em>énarques</em> at the top of the republic. They grew up together, slept together, learned the same rules and had the same teachers. They came from a school established at Charles de Gaulle’s instigation to train France’s rulers. Only <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d76b5fcc-b83f-11e2-bd62-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3qnRVMQxP\" title=\"\">80 students a year graduate</a> and what they are taught is everybody’s business.</p> <p>By contrast, Oxford University’s politics, philosophy and economics course was not established to create a ruling class. I am a PPE graduate – who isn’t, darling? – and can testify that there wasn’t then, and is not now, anything resembling an Oxford ideology. My teachers ranged from Marxists to free marketeers. Most had no discernible political views, ground down as they were by the joyless task of trying to make their students think clearly. It was a pleasure to have met them, although I worry sometimes that the feeling was not always reciprocated.</p> <p>Oxford’s triumph is the victory of a self-organising system, not a Gaullist masterplan. Ambitious young people who want to become politicians see that successful politicians have studied PPE. They apply to Oxford and become successful politicians themselves. Success breeds success and the machine feeds itself.</p> <p>You could say that Oxford’s dominance was acquired, like the British empire, in a fit of absent-mindedness. Not any more, I think. Oxford was never just a university for the British elite. In the mid-2000s, 5% of the world’s foreign ministers had studied at <a href=\"http://www.sant.ox.ac.uk\" title=\"\">St Antony’s,</a> Oxford’s postgraduate college for political studies. In 2012, Oxford opened the <a href=\"http://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Blavatnik School of Government</a>. The oligarch from Putin’s Russia, who now lives in London, secured the honour of having his name on the gate when he gave the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/20/the-billionaires-playlist\" title=\"\">university £75m.</a> “Fifty or 60 graduates of Oxford have been prime ministers and presidents, not only in this country but around the world,” he explained.<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/20/the-billionaires-playlist\" title=\"\"> </a>He wanted to see more like them. What these young ladies and gentlemen are taught, in other words, is now a matter of interest not just for Britain but for the planet.</p> <p>I have no grudge against Len Blavatnik. His school of government may produce searching examinations of Putin’s control of the media and suppression of the opposition in Russia and of crony capitalism the world over. He may privately despise the Kremlin regime, but go along with it in public, as anyone who wants to do business in Russia must.</p> <p>But if you can judge an oligarch by the quality of his opponents, Oxford is in trouble. Last week, better and braver people than Blavatnik will ever be told the <em>Guardian</em> that the university <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/03/oxford-university-accused-over-oligarch-len-blavatnik-75m-donation\" title=\"\">“should stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin’s associates”. </a></p> <p>Among the protesters were dissidents who are worth more than any billionaire. Vladimir Bukovsky, who was jailed by the KGB for revealing that the Soviet Union had decided it was insane to question the glories of socialism and sent its “mad” critics to psychiatric hospitals for treatment. Alongside him was the magnificent Andrei Sannikov, whom I met when he was an optimistic Belarusian politician who still believed that his country could be freed, only to have his hopes destroyed when the dictatorship jailed him for disputing a rigged election in 2010.</p> <p>You need not only weigh the leading players’ characters to get a feel for this dispute. We know that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/b276dcc0-0893-11e2-b37e-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?siteedition=uk&amp;_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fb276dcc0-0893-11e2-b37e-00144feabdc0.html%3Fsiteedition%3Duk&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.uk%2F376e4bf5d13c456f0a70f0df40f7360f&amp;classification=conditional_standard&amp;iab=barrier-app#axzz3qnRVMQxP\" title=\"\">Saudi Arabia has donated</a> to Islamic studies centres at Oxford and elsewhere. Whatever their scholarly virtues, they are not noted for their attacks on the myths and brutalities of Wahabbi theology. We have seen the London School of Economics demonstrate how soft dictatorial power works in academia. When Anthony Giddens and other academics ran a “North Africa research programme” funded by Colonel Gaddafi they fawned over their paymaster.</p> <p>To all of which one of my weary dons might say, so what? Walk round the university and you gaze at ancient colleges without thinking that they were funded by medieval warlords and Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries. You may admire, too, Hawksmoor’s beautiful Codrington library at All Souls without thinking that it was built with <a href=\"http://abajantourgirlexploringbarbados.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/barbados-african-slave-trade-and-sugar_20.html\" title=\"\">money from Caribbean slave labour</a>.</p> <p>It’s true, as the French say, that “behind every great fortune lies a great crime”. But British institutions are more impressed by the Russian saying that “you should never ask about the first million”. No one cares where Oxford’s colleges came from, just as no one cares that redbrick universities across Britain were funded by the masters of Victorian capitalism. Today the British, who were once colonisers, are now colonised. Oligarchies and dictatorships are where the money is. Is Oxford meant to turn it down?</p> <p>With a 900-year history, the university can take the long view. It understands that institutions survive and do good long after their once mighty benefactors have joined those they robbed in the dust. It’s always been that way. Except that in the 20th century it was not. The government funded research and academic expansion. There was, politicians reasoned, a national interest in having expert independent advice about dangerous powers such as Russia, just as there was a national interest in having health researchers who weren’t bankrolled by conglomerates providing advice on dangerous drugs and diets.</p> <p>The state ought to intervene today to prevent foreign powers exploiting British universities, in the same way as it should legislate to stop the epidemic of neurotic priggishness that drives student unions to ban speakers who diverge from the party line.</p> <p>I can’t see it happening. When universities take millions from Russian oligarchs or Saudi theocrats they are doing what the Conservatives want them to do: relieving the burden on the taxpayer by establishing a public-private partnership. How can a government, which is selling national assets to China on appallingly bad terms, tell universities not to sell their integrity? How can a government that wants to stop free speech, which does not incite violence, condemn student fanatics who do the same?</p> <p>If you want to see David Cameron’s big society, go to Oxford. You can’t say what you think, particularly when what you are thinking of asking is: who’s paying the piper?</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10958898","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403168","internalRevision":"159","publication":"The Observer","trailText":"As protesters criticise Oxford for accepting cash from a Putin crony, the state should stop foreign powers exploiting Britain’s great educational institutions","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Tainted money that belittles Oxford University","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Nick Cohen","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2015-11-08T14:18:08Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/1882e39d31e3d262114fc5ed7482826ad9688404/0_0_7277_4372/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4e2e6","wordcount":"1086","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/1882e39d31e3d262114fc5ed7482826ad9688404/0_0_7277_4372/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"563ddd41e4b0ace666f8b91f","newspaperPageNumber":"38","commentCloseDate":"2015-11-11T12:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>As protesters criticise Oxford for accepting cash from a Putin crony, the state should stop foreign powers exploiting Britain’s great educational institutions</p>","linkText":"Tainted money that belittles Oxford University | Nick Cohen","creationDate":"2015-11-07T11:15:13Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2015-11-09T08:27:02Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"458351555"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/tainted-money-belittles-oxford-university","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/08/tainted-money-belittles-oxford-university","sectionName":"Opinion","elements":[{"id":"1882e39d31e3d262114fc5ed7482826ad9688404","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/1882e39d31e3d262114fc5ed7482826ad9688404/0_0_7277_4372/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

Black what? Bargain what? I had to Google <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/black-friday\" title=\"\">Black Friday </a>because I couldn’t remember if it was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2007/oct/17/blackmonday\" title=\"\">1987 crash</a> or when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\" title=\"\">sterling plunged out of ERM</a> in 1992.</p> <p>Neither, it turns out – they’re Black Monday and Black Wednesday. Could it be the day <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/onedirectionmusic/posts/869295683125227\" title=\"\">Zayn Malik left One Direction</a>? Or the day the release of a Christmas advertisement by a large retail store made headlines in every outlet in the country and what we used to call “the news” rolled over and died?</p> <p>But, no. Black Friday does not mark the day John Lewis chose to release its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/tvandradioblog/2015/nov/06/john-lewis-christmas-advert-who-is-moon-hitler\" title=\"\">£7m campaign</a> and ascend to dizzying new levels of corporate smuggery. (A spokeswoman for the firm suggested it will raise awareness of the plight of lonely, elderly people that… oh you know, I can’t even be bothered. Most people over the age of 11 have a rough idea what advertising is for.)</p> <p>In fact – thank you, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)\" title=\"\">Wikipedia</a> – Black Friday is “the Friday following Thanksgiving” and in the US is “regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season”.</p> <p>And while I know that we’ve taken the concept of Halloween, as celebrated in suburban New Jersey, into our chilly British hearts, I don’t believe we’ve actually co-opted Thanksgiving yet? Have we? In which case, how can the “day after Thanksgiving” be a thing?</p> <p>And yet, here we are with the bold claim that it’s the biggest “ever”, ie “since we imported this shallow and vacuous marketing gimmick about two seconds ago”. But then, in some ways, there is something to be said for shallow and vacuous marketing gimmicks so crass they make the Argos catalogue look like the <em>I Ching</em>. Because while adverts might have bled into news, at least we know they’re adverts (not news), unlike an awful lot of what goes on social media and pretty much all of Instagram.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/06/john-lewis-christmas-advert-age-uk\">John Lewis Christmas advert 2015:  raising awareness for Age UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So while most of us over the age of 11 know what an advert looks like, on Instagram, the fastest-growing social network in the world, the fastest-growing demographic is children and young teenagers. Instagram doesn’t release figures, but just ask a tween. They’ll tell you, if they’re not too busy uploading selfies.</p> <p>Adverts on Instagram don’t look like adverts, they look like people. People who are wearing things they’ve been given, or photographing things they’ve been given, or being paid to wear or eat or display in their homes more or less anything that can be placed inside a stylised frame and pumped out to their thousands of followers.</p> <p>Essena O’Neill, an Australian teenager, made a splash last week by recaptioning her Instagram selfies to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/03/instagram-star-essena-oneill-quits-2d-life-to-reveal-true-story-behind-images\" title=\"\">reveal the truth behind the pictures</a>. In one, she wears a backless white dress and runs her fingers through her tousled blonde hair: “I didn’t pay for the dress, took countless photos trying to look hot for Instagram, the formal made me feel incredibly alone.”</p> <p>She struck out at the “contrived perfection” of Instagram’s hollow heart, but that’s not even the half of it. The invisible money spent on invisible advertising that nobody knows is advertising dwarfs John Lewis’s £7m. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/weworewhat/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Danielle Bernstein</a>, a 23-year-old Instagrammer with 1.3 million followers, has been one of the few to reveal the figures – she explained this year that she gets paid up to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/danielle-bernstein-the-fashion-blogger-who-makes--15-000-per-instagram-post/\" title=\"\">$15,000 for a single Instagram post</a>.</p> <p>It might look like pretty pictures, but Instagram is consumerism on a scale that makes one long for the hallowed sacred space of the Boxing Day sales. As Essena O’Neill points out, Instagram doesn’t do pain or fear or loneliness. If you’re lonely, your best hope is that a large corporate will come along and patronise you in its seasonal campaign. The kids are not just uploading selfies, they’re being gulled. We all are. #corporatemugs.</p> <h2>Enough of the public shaming over poppies </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a32e5ab385fd293b682d389ed5374db88ded64e0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a32e5ab385fd293b682d389ed5374db88ded64e0/0_0_2334_2066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sienna Miller falls foul of the poppy police on The Graham Norton Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"885\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sienna Miller falls foul of the poppy police on The Graham Norton Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Crossick/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was it for this that a generation of young men lost their lives in the Flanders mud? So that one day a pretty young woman could be pilloried for failing to wear the correct decorative memorial item? The annual outcry over which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-200964,00.html\" title=\"\">newsreaders are or aren’t wearing a poppy</a> – pretty much all of them apart from Jon Snow, who has taken a stance against “poppy fascism” – has now broadened to include anyone at all. Last week, Sienna Miller. This week, who? Kim Kardashian? Peppa Pig? The cast of <em>Animal Hospital</em>?</p> <p>Miller was forced to respond to criticism that she hadn’t worn one when she appeared on <em>The</em> <em>Graham Norton Show</em> by suggesting it was “a little extreme”. Extreme? A public shaming that included the <em>Sun</em> dredging up a former defence minister, Sir Gerald Howarth, who obligingly said: “There should be no excuse for not wearing one so we can honour the war dead.”</p> <p>It does make you wonder how many former defence ministers the reporter called before landing on Sir Gerald, It does make you wonder how many former defence ministers the reporter called before landing upon Sir Gerald. But it also makes you wonder if Miller’s real crime was to be young, pretty, female and, a week after Halloween, available for a public pillorying?</p> <h2>One long arm of the law for the rich…</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35b8e691b67249868575f1cfdf057ced12c70808\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/35b8e691b67249868575f1cfdf057ced12c70808/0_0_3339_4236/788.jpg\" alt=\"A Metropolitan police office: for hire, if you’ve got the money.\" width=\"788\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Metropolitan police office: for hire, if you’ve got the money.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RTimages / Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So this is how the future works. There will be cuts to basic services. There will be fewer social workers and nurses and police officers. But as George Osborne says: “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-tory-conference-video\" title=\"\">We are all in this together</a>.”</p> <p>Yet I’m alerted to an item in last week’s <em>Ham &amp; High</em>, the newspaper that serves Hampstead and Highgate, two of London’s most expensive postcodes, that the residents are <a href=\"http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/crime-court/hampstead_residents_to_raise_cash_for_their_own_exclusive_police_force_as_crime_turns_more_violent_1_4247670\" title=\"\">crowdfunding</a> a private police force. Only it’s not private. It’s not some heavies with a dog and a van – they’re raising money to buy three Metropolitan police officers and a sergeant, and in four weeks have raised £180,000.</p> <p>But then, crowdfunding in a neighbourhood where <a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/Hampstead.html\" title=\"\">the average house price</a> (terrace) was £2,095,464 last year or £3,598,514 for a semi-detached is never going to have the same challenges as some places. This, however, is not the most astonishing thing . T – that the rich will get their own fleet of private coppers while the rest will have no choice but to doff our cap at muggers and hope for the best. It’s that a Met spokesman explained: “<a href=\"http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/crime-court/camden_police_chief_slams_hampstead_s_plans_to_fund_their_own_officers_1_4262412\" title=\"\">Local authorities can currently fund their own police under the MOPAC MetPatrol Plus Scheme, whereby police officers are purchased by London boroughs on a buy-one-get-one-free basis</a>.”</p> <p>It’s bogof, like at Boots with shampoo. Buy a Met policeman and get one free. If that sounds like the punchline to a joke, it isn’t. It’s a loophole that a local lawyer, Jessica Learmond-Criqui, who chairs the <a href=\"http://content.met.police.uk/Team/Camden/FrognalandFitzjohns\" title=\"\">Frognal and Fitzjohn’s Safer Neighbourhood panel</a>, has discovered in the Police Act. In fairness, she is showing a canny consumer’s sense in leading the campaign to raise £200,000 a year to fund three officers, with three free ones thrown in.</p> <p>Why stop there? Will Hampstead have its own riot police? Why not a prison and a couple of tanks? We’ll be paying half, after all. And they may need them, if – when, surely, when – the peasants start revolting.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"10957888","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2015-11-08T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2403165","internalRevision":"126","publication":"The

least one angry letter from a leading model agency.</p> <p>But Conservative MP Caroline Nokes says she has become more passionate, rather than less, to take on the “arrogant” fashion industry and is determined to take her cause to the very heart of government policy – and she has no qualms about bringing the full force of legislation with her.</p> <p>Nokes is the latest public figure to take up the long-running battle to persuade designers, fashion houses, retailers and modelling agencies to take more responsibility in how they represent the female form and to stop the widespread use of underage and underfed models on the catwalks, on advertising hoardings and in glossy magazines.</p> <p>While there have been calls for ultra-thin models to be banned from London’s catwalks for more than a decade – in 2006, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/sep/16/uk.politicsandthearts\" title=\"\">Tessa Jowell, who was then culture secretary, made the case</a> – this time, says Nokes, there will be more than just another skirmish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

</p> </aside>  <p>As chair of the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/body-image.htm\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group on body image</a>, Nokes has picked up the baton with alacrity, publicly calling shame on the industry for “its wall of silence” on the issue of super-skinny models, who are part of a wider body-image problem. The committee will have an evidence session at the beginning of next month and has opened consultations to help it investigate whether legislation is needed to keep very thin models away from British catwalks.</p> <p>Nokes said there had been a “wonderful response” from health experts and academics on the issues, but no response from modelling agencies and fashion designers who had been asked to take part in the consultation.</p> <p>“They all got our letters. But they are either too scared or too arrogant to engage in a conversation,” she says. “This is not a confrontation, this is a debate. If someone can come forward and offer an explanation of why a size six woman is too large to model clothes when the average woman in this country is a size 16, then I am very happy to hear it. I’d like to know about why a sample size cannot be made in a size 10. I want to understand their justification. Because I think they are perpetrating a myth that only the sub-size six figure is desirable.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11c52fc699a8d793b05247b929d7b299bc87134\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d11c52fc699a8d793b05247b929d7b299bc87134/0_262_4452_2676/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tory MP Caroline Nokes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory MP Caroline Nokes is leading a consultation into whether legislation is needed to keep very thin models off the catwalks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hartley/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The investigation came <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/21/body-image-mp-considers-ban-on-ultra-thin-catwalk-models\" title=\"\">after a petition calling for fashion week health checks on models last month reached 30,000 signatures</a>. The petition was started by Rosie Nelson, a size eight model originally from Australia, who had been rejected by a British modelling agency until she was able to drop her body size “down to the bone”.</p> <p>“When I walked into one of the UK’s biggest model agencies last year, they told me I ticked all the boxes except one – I needed to lose weight. So I did,” she said. “Four months later, I lost nearly a stone, two inches off my hips. When I returned to the same agency, they told me to lose more weight, they wanted me ‘down to the bone’.” Other countries have already acted; Israel, where anorexia is a major public health issue, brought in a body-mass index (BMI) limit for working models and regulations on photoshopping in 2012. Catwalk models in Italy must show health certificates under a self-regulation code, Spain enforces a BMI limit and France passed a law in April stopping models from appearing on catwalks who had a BMI of less than 18 – meaning a 5ft 10in woman must weigh at least 8.9 stones. Anyone hiring a model below that can face a fine or a six-month prison sentence. World Health Organisation guidelines state that an adult with a BMI below 18 is malnourished. Yet, according to estimates, the average model working in fashion shows today has a BMI of 16, meeting the criteria for “severely malnourished” or anorexic.</p> <p>But neither Nelson nor Nokes are in favour of seeing models rated on their BMI, because they agree with many health experts that it is an imperfect way to measure an individual’s health.</p> <p>There are also reports of it working against the women concerned. Writing in the <em>New York Observer</em> earlier this year, former model Jennifer Sky <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/04/young-models-are-not-to-blame-for-industry-pressure-to-be-thin/\" title=\"\">said models working in Spain were told to work round the BMI weigh-ins by wearing weights in their hair and Spanx-style underwear lined with sand</a>.</p> <p>“I don’t think BMI is the right measure, because many models I know are size six to eight, and very conscious of their health and fitness,” said Nelson, who instead wants a mandatory health check for models every three to six months.</p> <p>Nokes is also against the BMI. “It’s a lousy measure for an individual’s health,” said the MP for Romsey and Southampton North. “I’m the first to acknowledge that legislation is not the answer for everything, but we are faced with an industry that’s out of step and thinking it can just go along with the situation, while health experts and academics are deeply concerned about the impact [it’s having] on our young people.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"321d52b42ad9bbc1d873e9687038aca58a4455a3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/321d52b42ad9bbc1d873e9687038aca58a4455a3/249_567_2178_3268/666.jpg\" alt=\"Cindy Crawford in 1996.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cindy Crawford in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nokes says that she has heard from models recently who say they have seen some changes, but these appear to be minor things, such as seeing more fresh fruit and water being made available at photo-shoots. While these sorts of moves might promote good health, they are unlikely to make a difference to body size.</p> <p>“At the same time, we are hearing that hundreds and hundreds of young women are regarded as disposable commodities by an industry that they are desperate to get into, because they see it as glamorous and well-paid when, in fact, the polar opposite is true,” she says. “It’s far from glamorous, it’s exploitative, and it may be well paid for a few individuals but not everyone can be Kate Moss.</p> <p>“For most young girls, the reality is that they’ll be regarded as washed up when they are 18.”</p> <p>She says that the situation has become worse as the industry’s definition of curvy has come to mean thinner and thinner models.</p> <p>In what some would describe as the heyday of modelling – when supermodels such as Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer reigned supreme – the normal model size was more like an eight or a 10. Nokes points out that it is perverse that while the average size of ordinary people has been rising over many years, the size of models has dropped. She points to research from the United States that suggested that 20 years ago the average fashion model weighed 8% less than the average woman, while today she weighs 23% less.</p> <p>“And it’s not just size,” adds Nokes. “We’re hearing from models currently inside this industry about the murkier side, about the pressures, the extremes, and while we’ve been told by agencies for years that they are cleaning up their act, it seems they are only chipping away.</p> <p>“I’d really like someone to come forward and explain to me why a size six woman is being told that her hips are too wide to be suitable to showcase clothes and why size 10 women are herded off to the plus-size section.”</p> <p>Nokes said she was finding more support for action among her political peers, saying that male and female MPs were meeting an increasing number of constituents worried about young people and the pressures of body image feeding into cyber bullying.</p> <p>“We have growing mental health issues among young people, and while the rise in social media is a definite factor, and so is exam pressure, this body-image pressure has huge ramifications,” she said. “What I’m conscious of so far is that this industry as a whole is clinging to an image of beauty which is unattainable and damaging, and that it is very, very reluctant to engage in why it is so wedded to this idea of a body that’s only found on androgynous teenagers.”</p> <h2>UNHEALTHY IMAGE</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76124d33025b9cbb0bbbf4a187c9b05c4daada2b\"> <img

The very purpose of freezing is to use eggs later and many that have been frozen have yet to be used.</p> <p>Freezing is a developing technique and there are difficulties in presenting the data in a manner helpful to women. For example, the recent fast-freeze “vitrification” process appears to be overtaking older slow-freezing techniques in popularity and success. But its newness means no substantial data analysis can yet be done. Do we present the slow-freeze data anyway?</p> <p>These are difficult decisions and we are wary of publishing inaccurate information that is not useful to patients. However, we recognise egg freezing is gaining in prominence and we will be introducing egg freezing data to our fertility trends reports.</p> <p>Lastly, comments that we are “making no serious attempt to control the vast fees charged” fundamentally misunderstands our powers. We are statutorily tasked with ensuring public and private fertility services are provided to a high standard, but have no powers to control or investigate cost. The requirement by us that clinics give patients a costed treatment plan in advance, introduced in 2009, is at the boundary of what we can do.</p> <p><strong>Peter Thompson</strong><br />Chief executive, Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Authority<br /></p> <h2><strong>True perils of over-population</strong></h2> <p>The <em>Observer</em> misses the point about increasing populations (“<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/01/observer-editorial-britain-china-population-challenges\" title=\"\">World population: it’s not just about numbers</a>”, leading article). Please don’t muddy the waters with talk about ageing populations and immigration. Population cannot continue to increase indefinitely.</p> <p>Increasing population is a global problem since everybody must be fed, watered and housed. The resources to enable this are finite. More people, especially in developed countries, mean more greenhouse gases, pollution and climate change. Because people everywhere are now mobile, we need to take a global view and not just consider one or two countries in isolation.</p> <p>There might seem to be some benefits in increasing the population in some countries in the short term, but even that relies on the questionable premise that continued economic growth is both desirable and possible.</p> <p><strong>Dr Brian Curwain</strong><br /><strong>Dr Mary Davies</strong><br />Christchurch, Dorset<br /></p> <h2><strong>BBC’s fate is in its own hands</strong></h2> <p>Nick Cohen makes an impressively passionate plea on behalf of the BBC (“<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/08/comment.theobserver1\" title=\"\">Traduced by all sides, who will defend the BBC?</a>”, Comment). Unfortunately, the central premise of his article is mistaken. The government has not imposed a 20% cut on the BBC. It has given the BBC five years’ notice that, as from 2020, it will no longer fund free TV licences for the over-75s. It will be entirely up to the BBC how and whether it chooses to collect licences from them after 2020.</p> <p>It is true that, in the period up to 2020, the BBC has agreed to part fund this concession, in exchange for other cash benefits, such as index-linking of the licence fee level, which equal that cost (and which will continue to benefit the BBC after 2020). But any change in the basic licence fee level will simply match any reduced set of obligations, so it remains the case that the supposed 20% cut in BBC income would only result from the BBC voluntarily deciding not to collect licence fees from the over-75s.</p> <p><strong>David Elstein</strong><br />London SW15<br /></p> <h2><strong>The errors of English rugby</strong></h2> <p>A conclusion that the review of England’s Rugby World Cup campaign (“<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/31/new-zealand-australia-rugby-world-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Irresistible All Blacks take proud place in history</a>”, Sport,) almost certainly won’t reach is the major difference in philosophy between the England and New Zealand rugby administrations.</p> <p>The All Blacks believe in long-term investment in players, thus instilling in the player confidence he has a long-term future with the team, versus a belief that only through competition could the best England team be forged.</p> <p>This led to many changes in key positions, particularly in the backs, and lack of confidence by the players that they had a long-term future.</p> <p><strong>David Murray</strong><br />Wallington, Surrey<br /></p> <h2><strong>End this roll reversal</strong></h2> <p>The news that the Wodehouse Society has banned bread roll throwing after red wine was spilt at the Houston convention (“<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/31/americans-celebrate-pg-wodehouse-in-seattle\" title=\"\">I say, Jeeves, we’re bally masters of jollity for these American chappies</a>”, In Focus) marks a sad decline in the mainly British tradition of mixing literary and cultural discussion with throwing food and drink.</p> <p>In his youth, Hilaire Belloc attended parties where discussion was enlivened by throwing port, so much so that a special brand of “throwing port” was provided for the purpose.</p> <p><strong>DBC Reed</strong><br

from <em>MasterChef</em>, get much tougher than this. Or at least that is what chef, presenter and judge of <em>MasterChef: The Professionals</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/nov/26/masterchef-professionals-monica-galetti\" title=\"\">Monica Galetti</a>, would have aspiring female chefs believe.</p> <p>She appears to have done her best to dampen the enthusiasm of any young woman minded to follow in her footsteps. Ahead of the launch of the new series of <em>The Professionals</em> on Tuesday, she told the <em>Radio Times</em> that women who were really serious about a successful career in a professional kitchen should probably think about putting off any thoughts of having a family – or possibly even a boyfriend.</p> <p>“At a certain point, women have to decide how much they want their career versus having a family and spending time with family,” she said. “That’s it. There’s no BS about it – the truth is you’ve got to put it first to do well. I’ve seen many amazing chefs, girls, come into the kitchen and then give it up to be with their boyfriend. Would he do that for her?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"962a37134dab3e22d58f289b428e77a155666540\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/962a37134dab3e22d58f289b428e77a155666540/0_0_3425_2274/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Galetti with fellow judges of Masterchef: The Professionals, Gregg Wallace, left, and Marcus Wareing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monica Galetti with fellow judges of Masterchef: The Professionals, Gregg Wallace, left, and Marcus Wareing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Shine</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/dec/12/monica-galetti-masterchef-professionals-final\">Monica Galetti: 'When I first met Michel Roux I just thought he was mean'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But is Galetti right? The evidence would seem to suggest so, given the relatively small number of high-profile female chefs. Behind the glitz and the glamour of the professional cookery shows, it seems the industry is struggling to keep pace with the times. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate that, while there are 250,000 professional chefs in the UK, only about a fifth of them are female.</p> <p>But Emily Watkins, for one, is having none of Galetti’s negativity. The chef-patron of the <a href=\"http://www.thekinghamplough.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Kingham Plough</a>, an award-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/17/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-kingham-plough-oxfordshire\" title=\"Read Jay Rayner&apos;s review of Kingham Plough\">pub-restaurant</a> in England’s Cotswolds, was back at work last week, two days after leaving hospital following the birth of her fourth child.</p> <p>“Although there are times when my husband would say that I’ve put my job before my family,” she says, “I’m happy with my career. I don’t think I could put any more into it or take any more out of it. I always wanted to be a chef and I always wanted to be a mum, but the business was my baby and I’d never missed a serving.”</p> <p>Watkins feels that Galetti’s words will do nothing to encourage women into an industry that is still dominated by men.</p> <p>“What she said is a little off-putting to girls because it makes you feel that your family and your career are mutually exclusive. People need to have more confidence in the industry and realise that you’re not going to be repelled for being a woman. Good chefs are very scarce. The demand for good chefs is so fierce that it’s an employee’s world.”</p> <p>For Watkins it wasn’t so much a question of balancing her career and her family as of the two colliding. She went into labour with her first childwhen she was at work, and with her second and third children she worked until the day before they were born.</p> <p>“With this [fourth] one I was able to have a week off before giving birth,” she says. “I’ve got a bit more of a balance now, although there have definitely been hard moments when I’ve had calls from the childminder saying one of the kids has got a runny nose and I haven’t been able to go.”</p> <p>Three hours drive north-west in the more remote reaches of the Isle of Anglesey, Claire Lara, the chefwho won <em>MasterChef: The Professionals</em> in 2010 and now works as head of food at <a href=\"http://www.oystercatcheranglesey.co.uk/index.shtml\" title=\"\">The Oyster Catcher</a>, Rhosneigr, points out the irony in the fact that, while some people are quick to suggest women should be in the kitchen, there are hardly any in professional ones. Lara, one of only two women to win the series, now has two young children, and moved to Anglesey partly to enable her to have a better work-life balance for her children.</p> <p>“I was pregnant doing <em>MasterChef </em>but I didn’t realise,” she says. “I was feeling sick and stressed out, but I just put it down to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/11/michel-roux-leaving-bbc-masterchef-potato\" title=\"\">Michel Roux Jr</a> [a former presenter and chief judge on the show].”</p> <p>Lara balances family and career with the help of her mother and her husband Marc, who also works at The Oyster Catcher as a sous chef. She says that, if women chefs do decide to have children, then it is better to make as much progress with their culinary career as they can before they take a break.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"105a35276a054ba34d150e89a432968a8df135fc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/105a35276a054ba34d150e89a432968a8df135fc/0_0_1330_2000/665.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Humphrey, head chef of Le Gavroche, London.\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Humphrey, head chef of Le Gavroche, London.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I was fairly career-driven,” she says. “I’d just made a decision to put off having children. The better the position you have in the kitchen, the more flexibility you have. The older you get and the more experience you have in the kitchen the better.”</p> <p>Many chefs point to the hard, physical work and the long hours as deterrents to advancement for female chefs. Others, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/25/my-family-values-tom-kerridge-chef\" title=\"\">Tom Kerridge</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.thehandandflowers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hand and Flowers</a> pub, in Marlow, Buckinghamsire, was awarded two Michelin stars, have suggested – much more controversially – that women don’t have the necessary “fire in the belly”.</p> <p>Rachel Humphrey, head chef at <a href=\"http://www.le-gavroche.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Le Gavroche</a> in London, says that she did choose to put her career first, but was aware of the consequences. “I made a choice to pursue my career when I was younger,” she says, the sound of the kitchen being cleaned between servings at Le Gavroche drowning out her voice as we speak. “I’m aware it’s a sacrifice I made, I’m not unhappy with it. When people I grew up with were meeting their future husbands and getting married, I was at work. I wouldn’t moan about it, that’s my choice.”</p> <p>She acknowledges the long hours are problematric, but not just for women. “I’m here all the time. I leave home at seven in the morning and get back at half past midnight. If you do this job at this level, the hours are antisocial for everybody, for the lads and the girls.”</p> <p>Marianne Lumb, owner and executive chef at <a href=\"http://mariannerestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">Marianne</a> in west London, is sympathetic to Galetti’s viewpoint: “To be any good in the kitchen you have to dedicate your life to it. You have to eat, breathe and sleep it, especially having your own restaurant. The hours are very long and to have a relationship is very difficult because the other person always has to come second. The more successful I’ve become, the more understanding men have been of that.”</p> <p>She says that now, at the age of 40, if she were to have a baby she doesn’t think it would be fair on the child. “It’s the first time in my life that I’ve started to think about it. But I don’t get down about it, because I’m sure I was put on this Earth to cook.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f8786d78b5a1a26f93605979339cd321d6fc2ef\"> <img
