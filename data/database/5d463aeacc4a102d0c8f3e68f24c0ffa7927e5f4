        "body":"<p>Well, that's my big race done. Target achieved, with the help of some terrible pacing (me) a mid-race hug (nice marshal) and a promise to myself that I will never have to run ever again (broken, I estimate, by lunchtime today). The Royal Parks half marathon was blessed with superb weather, a great atmosphere and 16,000 runners. Today I have extremely achy legs and a strange sense of anti-climax. Though I was cheered by this fact from the post-race press release I received: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The race also heralded the arrival of the new 'World's fastest fruit' in the shape of Tim Dye, CEO of Ateronon, who completed the course in 1hour, 34 minutes and 34 seconds (dressed as a Tomato) beating the previous record by just 21 seconds</p></blockquote><p>Good job none of the other fruit ketchuped with him, eh? (sorry) </p><p>Sunny streets of London aside, did you compete in one of the many other races this weekend? And is anyone else starting the cross country season soon - my first club race is only 2 weeks ago.

Give me your tips for beating running boredom, smashing through my mental running block and increasing my distance past that a paltry 5k.

If your partner&nbsp;gives you permission to inflict pain in an erotic context, the exact style&nbsp;and degree of that is agreed (understanding that the contract could be renegotiated at any time), and if&nbsp;you use appropriate safety mechanisms such as a \"safe word\", it is&nbsp;generally considered that consensuality is in place. But consent is brought into question when one has experienced physical, verbal or sexual trauma in the past, if you play under the influence of drugs or alcohol, if either has mental illness, or if permanent damage is likely to be caused. Consent is not just for the submissive person: you are conflicted about your dominant role, which in itself brings your consent into question. Think more carefully about your own limits. Define and express what is and isn't comfortable for you. And beware: dominant partners often experience burnout.

        "body":"<p>If you are getting divorced you may or may not be heartbroken, but your heart may actually be damaged in the process â€“ especially if you are a man. A&nbsp;report in the <a href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/jomh.2012.09.002\" title=\"\">Journal of Men's Health</a> lays out the evidence that divorced men have more health problems than their married counterparts: more heart attacks, high blood pressure and strokes, more cancer and even colds.</p><p>Divorced men are more likely to die earlier, have higher rates of alcohol and substance abuse and a 39% higher suicide rate than married men. Men who divorce also have less sex, and they are less satisfied with what they do have.</p><p>Research shows that divorced <sup></sup>fathers have poorer relationships with their children and less emotional support. Rates of depression for married men are 2%, compared with 10.4% for those who are separated. But would, and should, anyone even&nbsp;consider not getting divorced because of the health risks? And are only men affected?</p><h2><strong>The solution</strong><br /></h2><p>Up to  a third of marriages in the UK will end in divorce. The <a href=\"http://www.simpsonsissonsandbrooke.co.uk/blog/2012/11/16/the-most-common-causes-of-divorce-in-the-uk/\" title=\"\">reason most commonly cited is \"behaviour\"</a> (in around half of all petitions from women), which usually means falling out of love or growing apart. Women initiate divorce more often than men, and not because of infidelity. Only 15% of women and 16% of men cited adultery as the reason. Since unhappy marriages are stressful and, it would seem, damaging to health, it is surprising that divorce can make people even sicker.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23931947\" title=\"\">A Finnish study published this year </a>shows that even five years before ending their marriages, divorced couples reported 1% higher usage of antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs than those who stayed married. However, this figure rose to 7% for men and 8% for women in the six to nine months before the divorce. Afterwards, use fell but still remained 3% higher than among married couples.</p><p>Women may also not be wholly immune to increased incidence of heart disease after divorce, <a href=\"http://therelationshipcenter.us/wp-content/uploads/Gender-the-Marital-Life-Course-and-Cardiovascular-Health-in-Late-Midlife.pdf\" title=\"\">finds at least one study</a> (which also reports no rise for men). The authors linked this rise to women generally being financially worse off after divorce. They also argued that women take longer to recover from conflict in their&nbsp;marriages and continue to have higher levels of stress hormones for longer afterwards.</p><p>None of this, however, is likely to make a couple talk&nbsp;themselves out of a divorce. And if you think simply living together rather than marrying will help to keep you&nbsp;healthy, it is worth bearing in mind that research has&nbsp;found that <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.01269.x/abstract\" title=\"\">cohabiting couples who separate are likely to be similarly affected</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418995308|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|83566d442d942fc0cb799a993c15b5515a7386b7 -->",

        "headline":"Women and weight training: a heavy duty",
        "body":"<p>Two months ago, I was stopped in the gym by a portly, middle-aged man as I mopped the sweat from my eyes. \"I had no idea women could do that,\" he said, staring at me as if I was half-Martian. He was referring to the heavy weight I had just lifted off the floor.</p><p>It was not the first time I had been patronised by strangers or even friends&nbsp;(one of whom told me recently that he hoped I wasn't going to \"become one of those beefcake women\"). So, had I enough breath to respond, I might have told him that in 2011 the <a href=\"http://www.acsm.org/\" title=\"\">American College of Sports Medicine</a> published guidelines prescribing adults of both genders an exercise regime that includes muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week.</p><p>Similarly, the NHS recommends bodyweight and weighted resistance exercises. These activities build muscle, reduce the risk of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and type-2 diabetes, and could even lengthen your life.</p><p>In 1991, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Biomarkers.html?id=fw9GAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">William Evans  and Irwin H&nbsp;Rosenberg</a>, both professors at Tufts&nbsp;University in the US, published a study, titled Biomarkers. It established a number of factors that influence how we age, one of which was that the more muscle a person has,&nbsp;and the more strength there is in those muscles, the greater their life&nbsp;expectancy.</p><p>So why do so few women work out with weights?  We are certainly not as  underrepresented in other activities. Take running, for example: 57% of participants in this year's Nike Run to the Beat half-marathon, held in London, were women.  \"The industry has a lot to answer for,\" says <a href=\"http://www.gymetrix.co.uk\" title=\"\">Gymetrix</a> founder, Rory McGown, who since 2011 has conducted more than 20,000 surveys in UK gyms. His research shows that while cardio machine usage is equally split between men and women, only 7% of free-weight users are female. Out&nbsp;of approximately 8,000 women surveyed, just 3% named dumbbells as&nbsp;one of their three favourite pieces of&nbsp;equipment.</p><p>\"There's a stereotype of a groaning bodybuilding guy using the weights area,\" says McGown. \"Lots of other people, including smaller, less experienced male gym-users, want&nbsp;to,&nbsp;but many free weights areas are not big enough.\"</p><p>The fitness industry is trying&nbsp;to tackle this. <a href=\"http://www.fitnessfirst.com/\" title=\"\">Fitness First</a> recently rolled out \"freestyle\" sections in more than 80 of its gyms. According to the company's David Perrin: \"Our newer open-plan areas have huge amounts of variety, with kit such as dumbbells, kettlebells, steel bells and brightly coloured plyo boxes. We felt that women would feel more comfortable in these areas.\"</p><p>Brightly coloured boxes? Is this really what women want? Perrin continues: \"I&nbsp;definitely think that the more body-conscious women are intimidated in traditional weights areas.\"</p><p>David Stalker, CEO of <a href=\"http://ukactive.com/\" title=\"\">UK Active</a>, regards anything that gets women lifting as beneficial: \"Some operators have opted to offer women-only sessions, others have moved their resistance equipment to less exposed areas. The important thing is that women do not miss out on the opportunity to strength train because of embarrassment or intimidation.\"</p><p>On the other hand, female participation in bodybuilding, a sport with various different categories, does seem to be on the rise. The UK's largest health and fitness exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.bodypowerexpo.co.uk\" title=\"\">BodyPower</a>, this year reported a twofold increase in female entrants to the \"Physique of the Week\" fitness modelling competition and a 25% increase in powerlifting.</p><p>But most women are still suspicious of weight training. Fears about \"bulking up\" are common, says strength and conditioning coach <a href=\"http://www.evo-fit.co.uk\" title=\"\">Nolan Sunnassee</a>, but they are largely unfounded: \"Because of much lower levels of testosterone, a woman's hormonal makeup is not designed to add large amounts of muscle mass. Unless she's&nbsp;training six hours a day, six times a week and taking steroids, it's not going&nbsp;to happen.\"</p><p>As long as many women still find gyms â€“ and particularly weights areas â€“  unwelcoming, male-dominated spaces,&nbsp;it will prove difficult to tackle such misconceptions.</p><p>Laura Blacklaws, 30, has been resistance training either in a group or with a trainer since January. She would&nbsp;do it more often, but won't go into the weights room alone: \"It's quite&nbsp;a manly room, and the guys that train there are big and fairly intimidating,\" she says.</p><p>But are these men really so bad? Jane, a journalist in her 40s, thinks so: \"I won't stay long in the&nbsp;weights&nbsp;room,\" she says: \"The men&nbsp;are&nbsp;preening themselves. They're&nbsp;so noisy too, it feels like the men are given the right to be loud and&nbsp;take up lots of space â€“ and women give them that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418995565|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|391b1965637c89ed34c6f823bda9d76967464918 -->",

        "headline":"Sex Box: the participants reveal what actually happened",
        "body":"<p>What makes six apparently sensible people agree to have sex in a box on national television? That is what Dean and Rachel, Matt and John, and Lynette and Des have done, in order to help Channel 4 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/23/sex-box-tv-show-reclaim-sex-pornography\" title=\"\">reclaim sex from pornography</a>, the stated aim of its Campaign for Real Sex Season.</p><p>\"We had just got back from holiday,\" says Dean, 21, a supermarket delivery driver. \"We were shopping in Reading. A guy came up to us and said, 'You look like a happy couple. We're doing this programme based on couples and their sex lives ...' I guess because we were in holiday mode, we gave him the time of day.\" Matt has a similar story: he and John were on holiday in Manchester (to coincide with Pride) when they were approached. \"We said yes there and then,\" says Matt, although many subsequent phone calls, Skype conversations and face-to-face meetings with producers ensued.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/sex-box\" title=\"\">Sex Box</a> seems to promise so much â€“ the theory being that  people will talk more frankly about sex straight after having it â€“ but putting sex into a box hardly fits with the anti-repression mission statement. If sex needs to be out in the open more, what is it doing in a shed in the middle of a television studio, with flashing blue lasers around it to indicate that something <em>exciting</em> is happening within?</p><p>Host Mariella Frostrup calls it \"a unique space\", which makes it sound a bit like a pop-up gallery â€“ here for one 60-minute show only. Perhaps that is why time is on the mind of the participants. Off-camera,  they were told to spend around 30 minutes inside. Dean says he got around the problem of not over-running \"by taking my phone in with me\". It's not everyone's idea of a good time but his first act in the box was to \"set the timer\" on his phone.</p><p>Was there a bed? A rug?  Cushions? Dean says that his  contract prevents him from  describing the box's interior.  All he can say is that \"they tried to make it feel as homely as  possible â€“ like a hotel room\". There were washing facilities, condoms and tissues, an emergency switch, but no  ensuite shower. Matt concurs. \"It was very basic.\"</p><p>For Matt and John, there were other technical hitches. It turns out the box has another door not visible to studio or TV audience. \"The funny thing is, you see us going into the box,\" says John. \"Then, because of union rules, everyone can only work so many hours without a break. So we came straight out the back door and went to our dressing room. We were able to go for a shower and everything, and at least start some foreplay before going back in.\"</p><p>Putting people in a box to have sex, and then asking them to wait until the crew has had its tea, sums up all that is wrong with this show. What did any of the participants think they were going to achieve?</p><p>John and Matt are both chefs,  and John didn't come out until 2007, in his mid-30s, \"because I lived at work\". He felt he had no choice but to be honest with his colleagues. He and Matt live together but, says John, \"Our private life isn't exactly private. You can't really do anything. You can't have anything delivered without them knowing â€“ oh, another parcel for the gay couple upstairs. We were hoping to put a few facts right, that not all gay men wear dresses.\" Matt's reasons are similar. \"We're both gay but we're not really in a gay community as such. We don't have loads of gay friends. We thought just by being part of the conversation , we're doing our bit to show what it's like.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the actual show's post-sex conversations make post-match interviews with football managers seem exciting. (It's a pity they couldn't have got Roy Hodgson on to liven things up.) When Dean is asked the big question â€“ what did he and Rachel do in the box â€“ he seems embarrassed. \"Main thing first, taking the clothes off obviously. Then,\" he tells the panel, \"just a bit of foreplay.\" Rachel nods. \"Then straight into it.\" Into what? \"Into sexual intercourse, obviously,\" says Dean. None of the participants in the final programme is articulate about their box sex. Speaking on the phone, John is more eloquent. He says that his and Matt's experience was \"like when me and Matt did anal for the first time. We hyped it up so much. It was so much better after, when it just happened without being planned and nature took its course.\"</p><p>There is a lesson for everyone there. Pornography can sleep  easy tonight.</p><p><em>Sex Box, Monday 7 October, 10pm, Channel 4</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419078562|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|d4afd8920946759c1d390aabceec96383d2e9447 -->",

        "body":"<p>Marcella Hazan, who has died aged 89, introduced America to the delights of proper Italian cooking. In a series of books from 1973, she called time on the masquerade of Italo-American overcooked pasta slathered in viscous tomato sauces and crowned with mountains of inappropriate cheese. She insisted on authentic ingredients, a light touch with stocks (or, more properly Italian, broths), sauces and flavourings such as garlic, and the use of fresh, seasonal  produce. This was a revelation to Americans, just as their supermarkets, frozen and convenience food and tomatoes \"half-ripe, gassed, shuttled great distances and artificially quickened back to life\" had greatly shocked Hazan when she first arrived in New York in 1955.</p><p>Her books were influential in Britain too, although Elizabeth David's Italian Food (1954) had given it a head start, later capitalised upon by writers such as Anna Del Conte and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/18/guardianobituaries.food\" title=\"\">Patience Gray</a>. Certainly, come the late 1980s, when British cooks began to look away from France and concentrate on Italy as a principal culinary inspiration, Hazan's recipes were widely praised by such leading culinary figures as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/28/rose-gray-obituary\" title=\"\">Rose Gray</a> and Ruth Rogers of the River Cafe whose books, in turn, emphasised the simplicity and freshness of Italian cookery.</p><p>She was born Marcella Polini in Cesenatico, a seaside town on the Adriatic coast, in the province of Emilia-Romagna (the capital of which is Bologna, Italy's food central), to an Italian expatriate mother from Beirut and an Italian father. When Marcella was an infant, her parents moved to Egypt to be nearer to her mother's family and her father, a tailor, set up shop in Alexandria. However, at seven, she fell badly on the beach there, breaking her right arm. Complications from this injury necessitated a return home and extensive surgery. She never recovered full use of her arm, although she was able to grip a knife or hold an onion.</p><p>After the second world war, Marcella gained a doctorate in natural sciences and biology at the University of Ferrara and turned to teaching. In the early 50s she met Victor Hazan, a young American from an Italian-Jewish family who had fled to New York at the outbreak of war. When Marcella and Victor married in 1955, it was not with his parents' blessing. They would rather he had found a bride of like faith.</p><p></p><p>Soon after their marriage, the young couple were called to America to help in the family furriers business. Marcella took a job in a dental research laboratory, but it was shortlived owing to her lack of English, and the time she needed to devote to housekeeping for her husband. This meant learning to cook, from a copy of Ada Boni's great classic of Italian regional cooking, and to speak English, from watching sport on the television. Her kitchen apprenticeship was instinctual rather than learned: she cooked as she remembered meals in her youth â€“ and when she returned to Italy she found her productions were a fair simulacrum of the real thing. In all this, she was guided by her husband, cooking his lunch each working day and accepting his criticisms when her efforts were not up to scratch. This collaboration, with Victor often proposing a change of tack or new step in her career, was to continue all her life.</p><p>In 1962, by now with an infant son, they returned to Italy, where Victor worked in advertising, and the couple gained more experience of the food and cookery of regions other than Emilia-Romagna. When a further crisis in the family firm brought them back to New York in 1969, Marcella decided to learn more about Chinese food (given that the Chinese too enjoyed pasta and building up complex flavours). However, her Chinese teacher was called away by some family emergency, and Marcella's fellow students suggested she teach them about Italian food instead.</p><p>Rumour of these small cookery classes came to the ears of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/24/nyregion/craig-claiborne-79-times-food-editor-and-critic-is-dead.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\" title=\"\">Craig Claiborne</a>, then culinary arbiter of the New York Times and the guzzling classes alike, and in a landmark piece in 1970 he launched Marcella Hazan upon the world. Not long afterwards, it was suggested that she might write a book. \"But I can't write English,\" was her response. At this, Victor proposed that he translate her words into English (which he carried on doing for all her books) as well as imposing some sort of order and method on her instinctual cooking.</p><p>The Classic Italian Cookbook was published in 1973 by Harper's Magazine Press, to some acclaim, but no great sales. The style was quite peremptory, the recipes to the point, the cooking devastatingly direct. As much effort was expended in teaching the reader the Italian way of eating (that's Victor) as of the Italian way of cooking (Marcella).</p><p>The book and the classes were a passport to the American cooking elite: Claiborne, James Beard and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/aug/16/usnews.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Julia Child, </a>who was a friend. It was Child who suggested a move to the publisher Alfred A Knopf and their formidable editor Judith Jones. Knopf reissued the book in 1976 and followed it up with More Classic Italian Cooking in 1978 (published in the UK as The Second Classic Italian Cookbook, adapted for English readers by Del Conte). Later, Hazan moved to HarperCollins.</p><p>Fame had come to her quite late in life (she was nearly 50 when her first book appeared) but with undimmed vigour she and Victor expanded her cookery teaching in New York and then in Bologna and Venice. She retired to Longboat Key in Florida only with the dawn of the new century (but still had energy enough to write another book, Marcella Says (2004), to deal with the lack of decent materials in her new home). Hazan also wrote Marcella's Italian Kitchen (1986), Marcella Cucina (1997) and a memoir, Amarcord (2008).</p><p>She suffered from emphysema for some years. There was often a moment of surprise among younger Americans when they found that she had an enthusiasm for their tobacco and bourbon whiskey while viewing their food with some suspicion (\"We don't eat Italian food in America,\" she once remarked to an Oregon restaurateur).</p><p>She is survived by Victor and their son, Giuliano, himself a cookery teacher and writer.</p><p>â€¢ Marcella Hazan, cookery writer, born 15 April 1924; died 29 September 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419187493|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|4e12e4637498b6d63f9233834bfd635ece729b9e -->",

        "headline":"Let the fading foliage stand this autumn",
        "body":"<p>The beds at the front of the house are planted with bronze fennel. The south-facing position and a dry summer have suited them perfectly and they are standing taller than I am. From inside you look into their airy cages and on the warm days of autumn the ripening seed has wafted the smell of aniseed through the still-open windows. Though their foliage has turned cinnamon brown and ginger, they have plenty of life in them yet. When the birds think you are out, they descend upon the seed, and the stems are filled with a network of cobwebs. Standing firm and tall, they will weather the winter winds and, as they fade, one could easily argue they have yet to have their best moment.</p><p>It is tempting to wade into the beds where they appear to be falling apart. Weighted down by seed and autumn wetness, the topple might at first appear to be something that needs managing, but a little patience is timely. This is the moment to stand back and enjoy the autumn, and wait to apply energies in the beds. In a month or so you will see the keepers in the wreckage and a new order will assert itself. Hit by frost, the apparent bulk of nasturtium will wither and make you realise that they were not much more than water. The lush rosettes of <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/profile.aspx?pid=115\" title=\"\"><em>Hemerocallis</em></a> foliage will also succumb, but they will leave behind the upright bones of flower stem and seedcase. Let the worms drag the rotting foliage to the ground, where it will be converted to humus and leave it to stand a while, rather than fighting the season.</p><p>Bare is the most unnatural state for soil to be in. Exposed and raked clean, it is open to desiccation and to erosion, so a little untidiness now is  a good thing for a garden, not a sign of slovenliness. Our local farmer has already been cutting the hedges, the lines in the landscape taking on a new order, but the blackberries, wild currant and scarlet droplets of bryony are gone, the larder of shiny rosehips and inky elder disappeared in an instant. In a counter movement, I am holding on until the last minute, letting nature take its course before wading in and in turn allowing myself to feel a little more part of nature than the agent of control that is the gardener.</p><p>Of course we do need to assert some control if it is not to be taken from us, but the moves are strategic ones. I would prefer to let the rot happen and the birds to have the windfalls I cannot cope with in the kitchen than spend my energies battling an enormous wave. Very quickly the autumn will be in retreat, so my eyes are up and I am enjoying the colour while I&nbsp;wait to pick over the bare bones once the leaves come down.</p><p>I took two weeks off at the end of last month and based myself at home as an antidote to a summer of business. After a couple of days of allowing myself to settle â€“ and deliberately not adding to my mental checklist â€“ I, too, adjusted to the new order and saw beyond the topple of sunflowers and the browning dahlias. A little tidying to reveal the paths allowed me a way in and the clarity  of a free head to order my thoughts for a winter's work ahead of me â€“ and into planning where to plant my new brambles.</p><p>Crazy though it may sound, I am planting weeds again. Not weeds  I plan to let go, you understand, but a couple of forms of blackberry I have been meaning to grow for an age. <em>Rubus fruticosus</em> \"Himalayan Giant\" is a cutting from a friend who is slowly being engulfed by the beast, but she can pick a large bowlful of succulent brambles in a&nbsp;matter of minutes, the fruit is that plentiful. It can easily be wall trained if you have a fighting spirit. The second? A far more sensible choice for being thornless and of moderate vigour: the parsley-leaved bramble. Next  autumn when  I am beginning  to&nbsp;feel like  things are out  of control,  I will have  my distraction. A crumble or two of seasonal windfalls.</p><p></p><p><br />Email Dan at <a href=\"mailto:dan.pearson@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">dan.pearson@observer.co.uk</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418755257|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|bbeb061b52ebe7b5a74b120d5e1f89bf5b279b04 -->",

        "headline":"How do I stop my daughter leaving me to live with her mother?",
        "body":"<p><strong>The dilemma </strong><em>I am at my wits' end. My partner of three years has never really got on with my three children (she has her own three, who are incredibly hard work). Two of mine have left home so my youngest (age 12) is feeling particularly vulnerable, especially after my partner told her she is tired of my daughters treating me like shit. While I&nbsp;do not disagree with the sentiment, she should never have said it and she refuses to apologise. I feel I'll now lose contact with my youngest daughter, who could decide to live with her mother on  a near-permanent basis â€“ something hard for me to contemplate, as I fought to have equal parenting and love her to bits. What can I do?</em></p><p></p><p><strong>Mariella replies </strong>Quite a lot, actually! First, though, let's have a frank discussion about your current situation. I appreciate how annoying it is of me to ask, but shouldn't you have addressed this divergent approach to childcare at the beginning? Blended families are increasingly the norm and yet, when it comes to the health and welfare of the innocent bystanders to adult acrimony, we fail to discuss our philosophies until it's way too late.</p><p>Merging with another partner when you already have kids creates a new position of immense responsibility. No matter how fabulous a lover's attributes, their qualifications for step-parenting are worthy of equal scrutiny. It's ridiculous that mature adults think it's acceptable to allow passion to override all other considerations, as though they were hormonal adolescents in lust. Love is only blind if you decide to completely suspend the use of the gifts of reason and choice that set us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom. Viewed from afar, allowing the pulsating rhythms of passion to be the sole determining factor in our choice of future partner, having already experienced the drawbacks of that approach, is not rational behaviour. Yet most of us march blindly forward, propelled by the same emotions that got us into trouble in the first place, convinced on no evidence whatsoever that things will be different second (or third or fourth) time around.</p><p>I'm not saying that any future liaison need depend entirely on the parenting potential of the lover in question, but it should at least be a consideration. Neither do they need to have previously procreated themselves, but as with any person we'd entrust our children with, you need to understand their approach and establish how they foresee their future role. I appreciate it takes some of the romance out of any new union, but is that a bad thing?</p><p>Blended parenting seems a&nbsp;scenario ripe for a makeover. Grown adults responding only with their hearts and not their heads in an age when lifelong partnerships are a thing of the past is just silly. It's increasingly hard to distinguish the adults from the children when it comes to divorce. Often it's the children who wind up shouldering the majority of the responsibility during such periods of emotional turbulence and, as in your case, wielding an unhealthy amount of power over guilt-stricken or warring parents.</p><p>I'm afraid yours is an all-too-common problem. You say you agree with your partner's sentiments but not her actions, yet how difficult must it be for her to watch you responding through guilt and fear rather than a rational assessment of what's best for your child? Condoning your daughter's bad behaviour because you are afraid of losing her to your ex-wife is really not acceptable. Your child needs to know that your relationship with her is based on solid, loving foundations and sound parenting rather than emotional blackmail. You can't make such a&nbsp;Faustian pact to ensure your share of her childhood and expect a happy outcome. Your daughter will simply learn patterns of behaviour that will lead to misery now and in adulthood.</p><p>Your partner may not have handled it sensitively, but she's done you  a favour in raising the issue. There are frank and honest discussions to be had all round. As your daughter enters her teens it's essential that you and her mother work together to give her a stable infrastructure to fall back on. You still have time to send her out into the adult world with a better opinion of both her parents and an improved blueprint for relationships. It will take time, humility and a&nbsp;determination. It's not the easiest route, but it's the best one for your girl.</p><p>There's also a conversation to be had with your partner. I doubt her children are naturally \"difficult\" â€“ they are simply learning behaviour from the adults in their lives. Your letter suggests an unhealthy degree of antagonism toward each other's previous families, and that is a surefire guarantee of future problems. If you can't discuss things in a constructive way, then family counselling could be worth pursuing. In situations like yours there is rarely right and wrong, just misunderstanding and lack of communication. Sustaining a healthy level of dialogue that sees all the adults in a child's life working together, not at odds, is the key to the modern \"blended\" family.</p><p></p><p><br />If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a>.

        "headline":"Women and weight training: a heavy duty",
        "body":"<p>Two months ago, I was stopped in the gym by a portly, middle-aged man as I mopped the sweat from my eyes. \"I had no idea women could do that,\" he said, staring at me as if I was half-Martian. He was referring to the heavy weight I had just lifted off the floor.</p><p>It was not the first time I had been patronised by strangers or even friends&nbsp;(one of whom told me recently that he hoped I wasn't going to \"become one of those beefcake women\"). So, had I enough breath to respond, I might have told him that in 2011 the <a href=\"http://www.acsm.org/\" title=\"\">American College of Sports Medicine</a> published guidelines prescribing adults of both genders an exercise regime that includes muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week.</p><p>Similarly, the NHS recommends bodyweight and weighted resistance exercises. These activities build muscle, reduce the risk of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and type-2 diabetes, and could even lengthen your life.</p><p>In 1991, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Biomarkers.html?id=fw9GAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">William Evans  and Irwin H&nbsp;Rosenberg</a>, both professors at Tufts&nbsp;University in the US, published a study, titled Biomarkers. It established a number of factors that influence how we age, one of which was that the more muscle a person has,&nbsp;and the more strength there is in those muscles, the greater their life&nbsp;expectancy.</p><p>So why do so few women work out with weights?  We are certainly not as  underrepresented in other activities. Take running, for example: 57% of participants in this year's Nike Run to the Beat half-marathon, held in London, were women.  \"The industry has a lot to answer for,\" says <a href=\"http://www.gymetrix.co.uk\" title=\"\">Gymetrix</a> founder, Rory McGown, who since 2011 has conducted more than 20,000 surveys in UK gyms. His research shows that while cardio machine usage is equally split between men and women, only 7% of free-weight users are female. Out&nbsp;of approximately 8,000 women surveyed, just 3% named dumbbells as&nbsp;one of their three favourite pieces of&nbsp;equipment.</p><p>\"There's a stereotype of a groaning bodybuilding guy using the weights area,\" says McGown. \"Lots of other people, including smaller, less experienced male gym-users, want&nbsp;to,&nbsp;but many free weights areas are not big enough.\"</p><p>The fitness industry is trying&nbsp;to tackle this. <a href=\"http://www.fitnessfirst.com/\" title=\"\">Fitness First</a> recently rolled out \"freestyle\" sections in more than 80 of its gyms. According to the company's David Perrin: \"Our newer open-plan areas have huge amounts of variety, with kit such as dumbbells, kettlebells, steel bells and brightly coloured plyo boxes. We felt that women would feel more comfortable in these areas.\"</p><p>Brightly coloured boxes? Is this really what women want? Perrin continues: \"I&nbsp;definitely think that the more body-conscious women are intimidated in traditional weights areas.\"</p><p>David Stalker, CEO of <a href=\"http://ukactive.com/\" title=\"\">UK Active</a>, regards anything that gets women lifting as beneficial: \"Some operators have opted to offer women-only sessions, others have moved their resistance equipment to less exposed areas. The important thing is that women do not miss out on the opportunity to strength train because of embarrassment or intimidation.\"</p><p>On the other hand, female participation in bodybuilding, a sport with various different categories, does seem to be on the rise. The UK's largest health and fitness exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.bodypowerexpo.co.uk\" title=\"\">BodyPower</a>, this year reported a twofold increase in female entrants to the \"Physique of the Week\" fitness modelling competition and a 25% increase in powerlifting.</p><p>But most women are still suspicious of weight training. Fears about \"bulking up\" are common, says strength and conditioning coach <a href=\"http://www.evo-fit.co.uk\" title=\"\">Nolan Sunnassee</a>, but they are largely unfounded: \"Because of much lower levels of testosterone, a woman's hormonal makeup is not designed to add large amounts of muscle mass. Unless she's&nbsp;training six hours a day, six times a week and taking steroids, it's not going&nbsp;to happen.\"</p><p>As long as many women still find gyms â€“ and particularly weights areas â€“  unwelcoming, male-dominated spaces,&nbsp;it will prove difficult to tackle such misconceptions.</p><p>Laura Blacklaws, 30, has been resistance training either in a group or with a trainer since January. She would&nbsp;do it more often, but won't go into the weights room alone: \"It's quite&nbsp;a manly room, and the guys that train there are big and fairly intimidating,\" she says.</p><p>But are these men really so bad? Jane, a journalist in her 40s, thinks so: \"I won't stay long in the&nbsp;weights&nbsp;room,\" she says: \"The men&nbsp;are&nbsp;preening themselves. They're&nbsp;so noisy too, it feels like the men are given the right to be loud and&nbsp;take up lots of space â€“ and women give them that.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418995565|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|391b1965637c89ed34c6f823bda9d76967464918 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>My partner and I have begun experimenting with sadomasochism. I was reluctant but she really wanted to explore it. I was surprised that not only was I good at it, but that I took great pleasure in hurting her. This is a woman I'm madly in love with. I've always been a kind, gentle man so I'm disturbed that I so enjoy physically hurting another human being</strong>.</p><p></p><p>In BDSM,  you must understand the notion of consensuality. If your partner&nbsp;gives you permission to inflict pain in an erotic context, the exact style&nbsp;and degree of that is agreed (understanding that the contract could be renegotiated at any time), and if&nbsp;you use appropriate safety mechanisms such as a \"safe word\", it is&nbsp;generally considered that consensuality is in place. But consent is brought into question when one has experienced physical, verbal or sexual trauma in the past, if you play under the influence of drugs or alcohol, if either has mental illness, or if permanent damage is likely to be caused. Consent is not just for the submissive person: you are conflicted about your dominant role, which in itself brings your consent into question. Think more carefully about your own limits. Define and express what is and isn't comfortable for you. And beware: dominant partners often experience burnout. Adjust your level of play accordingly.</p><p><em>â€¢ Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders</em></p><p><em>â€¢ If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>private.lives@guardian.co.uk</em></a><em> (please don't send attachments).</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419072109|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|258408f64e27c08e63d87bddd6e11e8480f1bd86 -->",

        "headline":"Sex Box: the participants reveal what actually happened",
        "body":"<p>What makes six apparently sensible people agree to have sex in a box on national television? That is what Dean and Rachel, Matt and John, and Lynette and Des have done, in order to help Channel 4 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/23/sex-box-tv-show-reclaim-sex-pornography\" title=\"\">reclaim sex from pornography</a>, the stated aim of its Campaign for Real Sex Season.</p><p>\"We had just got back from holiday,\" says Dean, 21, a supermarket delivery driver. \"We were shopping in Reading. A guy came up to us and said, 'You look like a happy couple. We're doing this programme based on couples and their sex lives ...' I guess because we were in holiday mode, we gave him the time of day.\" Matt has a similar story: he and John were on holiday in Manchester (to coincide with Pride) when they were approached. \"We said yes there and then,\" says Matt, although many subsequent phone calls, Skype conversations and face-to-face meetings with producers ensued.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/sex-box\" title=\"\">Sex Box</a> seems to promise so much â€“ the theory being that  people will talk more frankly about sex straight after having it â€“ but putting sex into a box hardly fits with the anti-repression mission statement. If sex needs to be out in the open more, what is it doing in a shed in the middle of a television studio, with flashing blue lasers around it to indicate that something <em>exciting</em> is happening within?</p><p>Host Mariella Frostrup calls it \"a unique space\", which makes it sound a bit like a pop-up gallery â€“ here for one 60-minute show only. Perhaps that is why time is on the mind of the participants. Off-camera,  they were told to spend around 30 minutes inside. Dean says he got around the problem of not over-running \"by taking my phone in with me\". It's not everyone's idea of a good time but his first act in the box was to \"set the timer\" on his phone.</p><p>Was there a bed? A rug?  Cushions? Dean says that his  contract prevents him from  describing the box's interior.  All he can say is that \"they tried to make it feel as homely as  possible â€“ like a hotel room\". There were washing facilities, condoms and tissues, an emergency switch, but no  ensuite shower. Matt concurs. \"It was very basic.\"</p><p>For Matt and John, there were other technical hitches. It turns out the box has another door not visible to studio or TV audience. \"The funny thing is, you see us going into the box,\" says John. \"Then, because of union rules, everyone can only work so many hours without a break. So we came straight out the back door and went to our dressing room. We were able to go for a shower and everything, and at least start some foreplay before going back in.\"</p><p>Putting people in a box to have sex, and then asking them to wait until the crew has had its tea, sums up all that is wrong with this show. What did any of the participants think they were going to achieve?</p><p>John and Matt are both chefs,  and John didn't come out until 2007, in his mid-30s, \"because I lived at work\". He felt he had no choice but to be honest with his colleagues. He and Matt live together but, says John, \"Our private life isn't exactly private. You can't really do anything. You can't have anything delivered without them knowing â€“ oh, another parcel for the gay couple upstairs. We were hoping to put a few facts right, that not all gay men wear dresses.\" Matt's reasons are similar. \"We're both gay but we're not really in a gay community as such. We don't have loads of gay friends. We thought just by being part of the conversation , we're doing our bit to show what it's like.\"</p><p>Unfortunately, the actual show's post-sex conversations make post-match interviews with football managers seem exciting. (It's a pity they couldn't have got Roy Hodgson on to liven things up.) When Dean is asked the big question â€“ what did he and Rachel do in the box â€“ he seems embarrassed. \"Main thing first, taking the clothes off obviously. Then,\" he tells the panel, \"just a bit of foreplay.\" Rachel nods. \"Then straight into it.\" Into what? \"Into sexual intercourse, obviously,\" says Dean. None of the participants in the final programme is articulate about their box sex. Speaking on the phone, John is more eloquent. He says that his and Matt's experience was \"like when me and Matt did anal for the first time. We hyped it up so much. It was so much better after, when it just happened without being planned and nature took its course.\"</p><p>There is a lesson for everyone there. Pornography can sleep  easy tonight.</p><p><em>Sex Box, Monday 7 October, 10pm, Channel 4</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419078562|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|d4afd8920946759c1d390aabceec96383d2e9447 -->",

        "body":"<p>If you are getting divorced you may or may not be heartbroken, but your heart may actually be damaged in the process â€“ especially if you are a man. A&nbsp;report in the <a href=\"http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/jomh.2012.09.002\" title=\"\">Journal of Men's Health</a> lays out the evidence that divorced men have more health problems than their married counterparts: more heart attacks, high blood pressure and strokes, more cancer and even colds.</p><p>Divorced men are more likely to die earlier, have higher rates of alcohol and substance abuse and a 39% higher suicide rate than married men. Men who divorce also have less sex, and they are less satisfied with what they do have.</p><p>Research shows that divorced <sup></sup>fathers have poorer relationships with their children and less emotional support. Rates of depression for married men are 2%, compared with 10.4% for those who are separated. But would, and should, anyone even&nbsp;consider not getting divorced because of the health risks? And are only men affected?</p><h2><strong>The solution</strong><br /></h2><p>Up to  a third of marriages in the UK will end in divorce. The <a href=\"http://www.simpsonsissonsandbrooke.co.uk/blog/2012/11/16/the-most-common-causes-of-divorce-in-the-uk/\" title=\"\">reason most commonly cited is \"behaviour\"</a> (in around half of all petitions from women), which usually means falling out of love or growing apart. Women initiate divorce more often than men, and not because of infidelity. Only 15% of women and 16% of men cited adultery as the reason. Since unhappy marriages are stressful and, it would seem, damaging to health, it is surprising that divorce can make people even sicker.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23931947\" title=\"\">A Finnish study published this year </a>shows that even five years before ending their marriages, divorced couples reported 1% higher usage of antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs than those who stayed married. However, this figure rose to 7% for men and 8% for women in the six to nine months before the divorce. Afterwards, use fell but still remained 3% higher than among married couples.</p><p>Women may also not be wholly immune to increased incidence of heart disease after divorce, <a href=\"http://therelationshipcenter.us/wp-content/uploads/Gender-the-Marital-Life-Course-and-Cardiovascular-Health-in-Late-Midlife.pdf\" title=\"\">finds at least one study</a> (which also reports no rise for men). The authors linked this rise to women generally being financially worse off after divorce. They also argued that women take longer to recover from conflict in their&nbsp;marriages and continue to have higher levels of stress hormones for longer afterwards.</p><p>None of this, however, is likely to make a couple talk&nbsp;themselves out of a divorce. And if you think simply living together rather than marrying will help to keep you&nbsp;healthy, it is worth bearing in mind that research has&nbsp;found that <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.01269.x/abstract\" title=\"\">cohabiting couples who separate are likely to be similarly affected</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418995308|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|83566d442d942fc0cb799a993c15b5515a7386b7 -->",

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/mar/16/rosie-huntington-whiteley-face-2012\" title=\"\">Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a> has the kind of gentle beauty one might have sketched on the back of  a book during double maths in 1991. Sitting  with her in the restaurant of a Soho hotel is  to gratefully disappear. Not only do the other diners stare at her with the wide-eyed beam of cars at night, but outside in the rain hovers a middle-aged man with a camera. Everything about his  posture says: \"This wasn't the  life I planned.\"</p><p>It is an anniversary, of sorts. It is 10 years since Rosie, now 26, left school (and her  parents' Devonshire farm) to become a model. Last  summer she was promoted from face of Marks &amp; Spencer to designer (with M&amp;S's Soozie Jenkinson) of her own line â€“  it was the fastest-selling collection in the company's history.  A face of Burberry, and a&nbsp;Victoria's Secret \"angel\", today she lives in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jason-statham\" title=\"\">Jason Statham</a>, who has helped her move sideways into film â€“ she made  her acting debut in 2011, in Michael Bay's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140386/transformers\" title=\"\"><em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em></a>, and this year filmed another action franchise, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/05/mad-max-fury-road-namibia\" title=\"\"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. Although she says the words within implied quote marks, \"Brand Rosie\" is booming.</p><p>She was 15 when she interned at a modelling agency, and 16 when she started modelling. She still had her braces on. \"I wanted to get out of Devon so desperately. London for me was where the big lights were.\" She wanted to work in fashion, \"but I was never particularly fashionable. Devon didn't allow for those opportunities.\" The first time she thought properly about trends, she recalls with sweet discomfort, was as a young teenager when she bought a fake pair of Ugg boots on eBay.  \"I remember walking into a restaurant wearing them,\" she says, \"and literally everybody turned to look at me, and they all laughed.\"</p><p>People are still turning to look at her today. In the week's run-up to our interview the tabloids are reporting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/04/rosie-huntington-whiteley-jason-statham\" title=\"\">alleged problems in her relationship</a> with Statham. In the time it's taken for us to order a coffee, another paparazzo has arrived outside. \"It can become uncomfortable,\" says Huntington-Whiteley.  \"I remember having a conversation with one of my girlfriends in New York,  a very famous model, and she said: 'It's so exhausting to have to constantly try and be what everyone wants me to be.'\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418974923'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380637217180/Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-008.jpg' alt='Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Jason Statham' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rosie with her actor partner Jason Statham, who has helped her move into film. Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex Features</figcaption></figure><p>What does everyone want Rosie to be? The \"face\" of  a retailer is a large investment, crucial to  a brand's success or failure. Says Verdict retail analyst Honor Westnedge: \"A retailer like Marks and Spencer with a&nbsp;large target audience for lingerie must be careful not to alienate customers. It needs a&nbsp;likable and accessible model.\" M&amp;S tells me its customers love Rosie. \"Not only is she beautiful,\" says Jenkinson, head of design for lingerie, \"but there is also something very grounded about her that resonates with our customers.\"</p><p>Really? This is the woman who was voted World's Sexiest Woman by <em>FHM</em> readers. She has a double-barrelled surname. And she's a \"<a href=\"http://models.com/rankings/ui/MoneyGirls\" title=\"\">money girl</a>\" â€“ industryspeak for models earning six-figure sums, from power brands such as Victoria's Secret and Calvin Klein. She is all the things the M&amp;S customer is not. As far-reaching and diversified as we are, with our superfood salads and multi-packs of socks, the M&amp;S woman does not live in LA, is not 26, with a body built from yoga and baby oil, does not have the legs and eyes of a relaxed fawn. When I ask M&amp;S to describe their typical customer, they reply quickly: \"The M&amp;S  customer is the British public.\"</p><p>Lingering by the bras in a central London store, I ask a 50-year-old woman looking for a Rosie for Autograph set in a 38B what the appeal is. She doesn't know who Huntington-Whiteley is, though she recognises her face from buses, but she loves the \"luxury\" of the lingerie â€“ \"the lacy details\". She leaves with the dove-grey satin bra and midi knickers, proving that it shouldn't work but it does. More than 600,000 pieces of Huntington-Whiteley's collection have been sold this year. At any time, one in three women in Britain is wearing an M&amp;S bra. One of them will always be a Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.</p><p></p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418974924'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380636526078/Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-008.jpg' alt='Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in black lace' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rosie wears a leather skirt by Preen, a lace body by & Other Stories and a cardigan from her own line, Rosie for M&S. Photograph: Nick Haddow for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>Her success means much of her life is spent mid-air. She commutes between London and LA. \"The world seems very small now,\" she says. On a&nbsp;recent flight, when she woke from a nap the man in the next seat leaned over and said: \"There were people trying to take a picture of you when you were sleeping.\" \"Everyone's paparazzi,\" she says with  a sighing shrug. \"The moment you leave your house you've got to be ready for somebody to be taking something of you, someone who's going to be making money from you.\" She shouldn't complain though, she says. \"You go: 'It's good for my brand, it's good for my brand.'\" Which, yes, it is. It must be. But doesn't  it send a person mad? \"Oh, no one wants to  fucking hear that.\" She swears politely, with an angry  elegance I quite like. \"And it's not my reality.\"</p><p>The<em> Daily Mail </em>runs a story on her every day â€“ some are positive, some scathing. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2009631/Transformers-Dark-Moon-slammed-critics-slate-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteleys-acting-skills.html\" title=\"\">Her performance in the <em>Transformers</em></a> film was ridiculed, scene by scene. A critic for <em>Empire</em> magazine wrote: \"Michael Bay introduces [Huntington-Whiteley] with a self- parodying shot of her barely clad bottom and it's all downhill from there. You'll believe a robot can fly, but you won't believe a Huntington-Whiteley can talk.\" Does she read Mail Online? She sighs, and half-smiles. \"I'd be lying to say I didn't. I have a much healthier relationship with it now than a few years ago. It was very upsetting for me â€“ there was this other Rosie that was becoming famous and  it was quite an out-of-body experience. I didn't know how to handle it. I cut myself off from everything.  I wouldn't go on the internet. I hid for quite  a while. I got very nervous in public, actually.\" Of the reaction to her film debut she says: \"There wasâ€¦ not a lot of support for me during that time.\" One minute she was \"trundling on\" as a model, \"then all of  a sudden I'm on the biggest movie of all time. I'm on  set as a lead role, but with no idea what I'm doing.\" She takes a deep breath. \"I took the opportunity, because  how was I supposed to say no?\" \"[But] people want to see you fall. Your fans want to see you fall. Everyone wants  to see you fall.\"</p><p>And then she laughs. <em>GQ</em> once described her mouth  as \"overflowingâ€¦ to the point of vulgarity\". They said  she was \"well mannered but rude to look at\". Most descriptions of her follow a similar pattern â€“ you can smell sports deodorant in the ink. And yet her impossible sexiness somehow sits comfortably with her broad  appeal to women; the thing that draws men to pictures of Rosie in her underwear draws women to the  underwear itself. For a model, that's a rare thing. After  10 years in the industry, she's watched it change with interest. When she was starting out, one agent advised her to eat  \"a single piece of sushi a day\". \"My eloquent response was: 'Go fuck yourself!'\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418974925'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380636659585/Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-008.jpg' alt='Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in cream headpiece' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Rosie wears a headpiece by Simone Rocha, and a jumper from Rosie for M&S  Photograph: Nick Haddow for the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>She chuckles. When she started with her new agency she asked them how it helped the younger girls. \"Because I felt that there was never anything for me, no workshops, no people letting you know how you should be eating  or what you should be wearing to castings.\" For the  new faces of today there are talks and nutritionists â€“ proper advice.</p><p>\"There's been a real shift,\" she says. \"It's been a funny 10 years to be in the industry. I started in 2003, when castings were sent to me by fax. Now everything is put out on social media as soon as it's shot. There's more engagement. Everybody wants to know the models. You're more real now than ever.\" More real? \"You're no longer this one-dimensional image. Perhaps the paparazzi is part of that. It's more expected now for supermodels to be smart, to  have opinions, to have a personality.\"</p><p>Part of this â€“ part of having a voice, a personality â€“ is the expectation that she will expand her remit from modelling to acting, to designing. And she revels in it, the opportunities to work, the subsequent longevity of a model's career. \"I mean, it's self-indulgent. It's not like I'm a nurse or I'm helping people with their finances. I think it's important to be aware of that. I have seen people who think they're doing something really noble for the world, and it's like: you're making a movie. You're doing what makes you happy, but get real right now. Certain people take themselves very, very seriously and it's just unnecessary. That's a funny thing with celebrity and charity work, too, isn't it? It's not selfless, either.\"</p><p>Outside, the rain has got heavier and Soho is slick with wet newspapers. One of the photographers has run  for shelter; the other is still there, his jacket pulled over his forehead like a hood, his camera hanging on his wrist. I leave the hotel, then turn back. I want to talk to him â€“  to find out a little about his life, to find out what his pictures of this woman, taken through steamed  windows with an expensive lens, are worth. But  seeing me approach, he slips his camera behind his back  and quickly walks away.</p><p><em>The</em> Rosie for Autograph Sleepwear Collection<em> is available to buy at M&amp;S stores and online at </em><a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/Rosie-Autograph-All-Brands-Lingerie-Underwear-Womens/b/2711532031\" title=\"\"><em>marksandspencer.com/rosie</em></a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418753046|2013-10-07T10:05:52Z|7ccef258a799fadfa60a1e899aec1ac58431be6b -->",
