Red or Sliver. Poverty or power. Destined for battle or destined for greatness. Seventeen-year-old Mare is one of the unlucky ones. With no apprenticeship, she accepts the reality that she is going to follow her three older brothers into the war.<br /></p> <p>Suddenly, her world becomes a distorted map of lies. The king and queen - both Silvers - discover that Mare may be a threat to their kingdom because she possesses an ability. A superhuman power that only Silvers are meant to have authority over. Dressed up to play the part of a long-lost princess, Mare realises that anyone can betray anyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6d405c894753002cd65a425db6eef8a763dda417\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440583584476/2cf0dc8c-a20a-42ca-8925-eca1346051d5-276x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Red Queen\" width=\"276\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After reading some glowing reviews about this book, I had high expectations. I’m very pleased to say that they were met! The way Aveyard weaved in so many twists and turns into the plot was supreme and despite only finishing this book a couple of days ago, I already want to read it again.</p> <p>The intricacy of the descriptions and situations give me an inkling that this will be a book that I will read many times and I will notice something slightly different. Even though I read the book with the attention that a predator gives its prey.</p> <p>This dystopian thriller had me gripped from the beginning.

Russell Brown obituary","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-09-09T13:56:43Z","fields":{"wordcount":"897","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4c8ft","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>John Russell Brown, who has died aged 91, was a distinguished Shakespearean scholar who was also involved in practical theatre – he was a close associate of the director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/peter-hall\" title=\"\">Peter Hall</a> at the National Theatre for 15 years from 1973 – but was paradoxically opposed to directors filtering the plays though their own ideas, concepts and interpretations.</p> <p>In one of his many books, Free Shakespeare (1974), he advocated the primacy of Shakespeare’s musical language in contemporary production, the aspiration of an Elizabethan style of spontaneity in performance, and unostentatious decor. He seemed not to see the irony in adopting so idealistic and conceptual an approach himself; his advocacy turned Hall into a reformed classicist and led to austere and unexciting NT productions of Hamlet and Macbeth, both starring Albert Finney, in 1976 and 1978.</p> <p>At least he was consistent, seeing no division at all between his response to Shakespeare when he read the plays, taught them in a classroom, saw them in performance, or worked on them in the theatre. As well as his books on Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies and dramatic style, he prepared new editions of The Merchant of Venice and of John Webster’s two masterpieces, The Duchess of Malfi and The White Devil, and directed productions of the plays in locations as various as Liverpool, Dunedin in New Zealand, and Seattle and Pittsburgh in the US.</p> <p>In his field, he was regarded as a pioneer; he took forward the work of <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_History_of_English_Drama_1660_1900.html?id=mgSZjOrtHZgC&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Allardyce Nicoll</a>, who in 1951 founded the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon with a view to working closely with Barry Jackson, who was then running the Shakespeare Festival in the Memorial Theatre in Stratford. This relationship between the academic world and the Royal Shakespeare Company – exemplified in the career of Russell Brown’s friend and successor, <a href=\"http://stanleywells.co.uk\" title=\"\">Stanley Wells</a>, who became a governor and vice-chairman of the RSC – has varied in intensity but is undergoing a renewal in Gregory Doran’s artistic directorship. The Nicoll revolution was to consider Shakespeare not just as text, but as text in performance.</p> <p>Russell Brown’s scholarly articles in publications such as Shakespeare Survey, Critical Quarterly and the Tulane Drama Review were always worth reading. His 1957 book Shakespeare and His Comedies was one of the first to take the comedies seriously, and his more recent editions Directors’ Shakespeare (2008) and Actors’ Shakespeare (2011) – with essays by Wells on Judi Dench and Paul Edmondson on Harriet Walter – are essential documents of the contemporary theatre.</p> <p>He edited the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Oxford-Illustrated-History-Theatre/dp/0192854429\" title=\"\">Oxford Illustrated History of the Theatre</a> (2001), one of the outstanding books of its kind, with definitive essays by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/27/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Martin Esslin</a> (on modern theatre 1890-1920), Peter Holland (18th century), Oliver Taplin (Greek theatre) and Peter Thomson (English Renaissance and Restoration drama), Russell Brown himself providing a magisterial, international overview of theatre since 1970. Unlike many Shakespearean scholars, he kept up to date, supporting Hall in his championing of Edward Bond, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/howard-brenton-life-in-theatre\" title=\"\">Howard Brenton</a> and David Hare at the National, and he remained well informed on developments across Europe and in America and Japan.</p> <p>He was the second son of Russell Alan Brown, a first world war veteran and pork butcher, and his wife, Olive (nee Golding), a teacher. The family lived above the shop in Gloucester Road, Bristol, and the boys, David and John, were educated at Monkton Combe school, near Bath. David was destined for the church – he became, eventually, bishop of Guildford. John left school aged 15 and joined the family business but caught the theatre bug at seaside pier shows. When the second world war broke out in 1939, he joined the Fleet Air Arm and was transferred to Scotland, where he serviced pitfires and luckily avoided a posting on a ship that sank with all hands on board.</p> <p>After the war, he found his way to Keble College, Oxford, where he read English and tutored undergraduates in Anglo-Saxon, supervised by JRR Tolkien. His academic career started at the Shakespeare Institute, where he was a fellow (1951-55), followed by 10 years as an English lecturer at Birmingham University, becoming professor and head of drama and theatre arts at Birmingham from 1964 to 1971. Ever active, ever busy, he was professor of English at Sussex University (1971-82) during his time with Hall. When Richard Eyre succeeded Hall at the NT and appointed Nicholas Wright as his literary manager, Russell Brown concentrated on his writing and was professor of theatre at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1985-97).</p> <p>For Hall, he regarded himself as “a resident researcher and critic in search of plays that surprise me”, and he directed one or two of them himself, including Alegrio Alonso’s Crossing Niagara at the ICA in 1975, Peter Handke’s They Are Dying Out at the Young Vic in 1976 and Barry Collins’s Judgement in the NT’s Cottesloe in 1977, the last of these a searing monodrama for a cannibalistic Russian army officer, played by Ben Kingsley.</p> <p>Tall, affable, industrious and encouraging – and a keen gardener – Russell Brown represented the best of the scholar/practitioner/teacher tradition he helped establish in British theatre.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Hilary (nee Baker), whom he married in 1961 when she was a student of his at Birmingham, their three children, Jasper, Alice and Sophie, and nine grandchildren.</p> <p>• John Russell Brown, Shakespearean scholar and director, born 15 September 1923; died 25 August

schoolchildren in fiction","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-09-09T11:47:06Z","fields":{"wordcount":"1415","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4c6zj","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p> At the beginning of September, they are scrubbed and expectant. “I have enough gunpowder in this jar to blow up this school,” says Muriel Spark’s Miss Lockhart. It’s her party piece for the first science lesson. All is new.</p> <p> Like a spool in Samuel Beckett’s play Krapp’s Last Tape, school goes on interminably. Press rewind or fast forward and it’s still playing. Childhood, adolescence. Add in teaching and parenting for me. I no longer attend classes or assemblies. I rarely walk along a school corridor. But what is concealed intrigues me. Every schoolchild, real or fictional, is an insider with off-the-record information. Don’t trust guidelines on transparency. Parents are the last to know, as Lorna Parry in my new novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/320745/s/another-mother-s-son/\">Another Mother’s Son</a>, discovers.</p> <p> Six of the children in my top 10 go on to become adult; the others are kept behind in class for ever.</p> <p><strong>1. James Steerforth in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/30/david-copperfield-dickens-100-best-novels\">David Copperfield</a> by Charles Dickens</strong><br /></p> <p>I have always fancied Steerforth, who is in control and outward looking. The character is in the name, but not wholly: ennui hangs about this charmer. The boys of Salem House worship him and cane-happy Mr Creakle dares not lay a hand on him. He has insomnia. His mind is not as quiet as it might be for a star pupil. This adds to the interest. One wet Saturday, the boys go berserk: hapless Mr Mells is demolished by Steerforth – and dismissed. The episode leaves a vile taste. DC joins in three cheers as Mr Creakle warmly shakes Steerforth’s hand. If Dickens reappeared in the 21st century, he would have an instant understanding of approval ratings.</p> <p><strong>2. Nanda Grey in Frost in May by Antonia White</strong><br /></p> <p>To the usual claustrophobia of school, add the Roman Catholic church. Nanda is in the Convent of the Five Wounds. She is new to the faith, and her unshakable outsider status makes her hyperattentive to the bells, smells and mind-boggling tales told by the nuns. Her friends, cradle Catholics of grand European families, reveal exotic home lives. Nanda feels dull in comparison. The novel she writes in the infirmary during a bout of measles falls into Mother Radcliffe’s hands. Nanda’s romantic creation does not find favour. In the closed world of the beautiful and the barmy, some fictions are more acceptable than others. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/27/top-10-unlikely-friendships-alex-hourston\">Top 10 unlikely friendships in fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3. Kenneth Widmerpool in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/03/question-of-upbringing-anthony-powell\">A Question of Upbringing</a> by Anthony Powell</strong><br /></p> <p>Kenneth Widmerpool is defined at the outset by the wrong kind of overcoat. His first appearance, as he hobbles through a misty Thames Valley on the way back from a solitary run, sets the tone. His more savvy contemporaries see him as pompous, but Powell’s 12-novel cycle gives this academic and sporting nonentity if not the last laugh, then at least the scope to turn into a mild success in worldly terms. With his thick lips and metal-rimmed spectacles, he’s no one’s friend, but continues to crop up – as Etonians do. The slavishness and absence of imagination that made him a joke at school turn out to be just the ticket with the English establishment. Who would have guessed?<br /></p> <p><strong>4. Sandy Stranger in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/23/100-best-novels-the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie-muriel-spark\">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</a> by Muriel Spark</strong><br /></p> <p>Up to Edinburgh and to Miss Brodie’s special set at Marcia Blaine School. I’ve picked Sandy Stranger, with her “little screwed-up eyes” and immaculate enunciation. All five girls are mesmerised by their charismatic teacher but Stranger alone has the cross-examining skills to whittle out facts. Extracurricular study of the Sunday newspapers gives her insight into adult impurity and helps reveal the truth of Miss Brodie’s relations with Mr Lloyd, the art master (vicarious), and Mr Lowther the music master (real but unsatisfying). The uncovering brings diminishment: sadness as well as pleasure. Through Spark’s glorious technical feat of interleaving the past with the future, we discover what becomes of them all. Sandy Stranger takes holy orders.<br /></p> <p><strong>5. Charles Fox in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/young-desire-it.html\">The Young Desire It</a> by Kenneth Mackenzie</strong><br /></p> <p>The temperature is hotter for Charles Fox, and not just because his boarding school is in western Australia. I have lost Spark’s cool stare and am pressed against boys. “The folding doors were closed; the classroom was half its previous size” when they assault fourteen-year-old Charles on a table to check if he’s a girl. Penworth, a young classics master fresh out of Oxford and 10,000 miles from home, also spots his beauty. The befriending that follows consoles and repels. Embarrassment, rage, frustration, bewilderment all occur, as in adult life, but at a slower pace, drawn out over long days. Trapped for several years in this outpost of Englishness, Charles yearns for freedom – the “it” of the title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ecec843c006acd2aa4c66bbe86ce632aa85ddb6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/8/1441718985209/5caec283-c3ff-40df-baf5-d7e52095c696-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Charlotte Gainsbourg in the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Eyre.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Gainsbourg in the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Eyre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Miramax</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. Jane Eyre in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/09/100-best-novels-jane-eyre\">Jane Eyre</a> by Charlotte Bront</strong><strong>ë</strong><br /></p> <p>“Send me to school soon, Mrs Reed, for I hate to live here.” This is said in defiance, because the plan is already in train. Jane is admirably direct. She is packed off to Lowood Institution for orphans. The long, mysterious journey to reach the place, the setting in a forest dell, a “fog-bed of pestilence”, Mr Brocklehurst, the evil benefactor, Miss Temple the good headmistress – these are fairytale ingredients, but Jane is her own person, alive and spontaneous. Her experience and witness of cruelty is sharp. Who could forget the episode when, having accidentally broken a slate, she is made to stand on a stool, while Brocklehurst publically humiliates her? Jane feels every sting but is not crushed.</p> <p><strong>7. Törless in The Confusions of Young Törless by Robert Musil</strong><br /></p> <p>At night, in the attic of a military academy, a boy is repeatedly tortured by two power-crazed schoolmates; a third, Törless, is drawn in and participates – up to a point. His equivocation is the hinge of the novel. Daytime reality of uninspired teaching and sensible letters from parents hints at a safer world but does little to offset the agonising. In asides and glimpses, Musil intimates that adulthood, like school, might be the same “everlasting waiting for something you don’t know anything about” – but with the senses more blunted. </p> <p><strong>8. Claudine in Claudine at School by Colette</strong><br /></p> <p>The child safeguarding team would be run off their feet in Montigny. The place squirms with inappropriate behaviour. Motherless Claudine, with her unworldly, mollusc-fixated Papa, chooses to attend the local elementary school rather than go off to a lycée or convent with the other middle-class daughters of the village. The girls stitch lingerie, the boys turn table legs. Claudine falls for Mademoiselle Lanthenay, but loses her to the predatory new headmistress who swiftly installs her in her bedroom. Far from crushed by the setback, Claudine spies, gossips, entertains her friends and wards off pervy bureaucrats. She educates herself at home in peace. School is for action. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfd8efa4cb48cf73b19096d350755cdb8ee8293c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441799120399/4f55e3cb-2524-4dad-bc84-13216c461926-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hugh Edwards as Piggy (right) in the 1963 film of Lord of the Flies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Edwards as Piggy (right) in the 1963 film of Lord of the Flies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>9. Piggy in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/16/lord-of-the-flies-100-greatest-novels-william-golding-mccrum\">Lord of the Flies</a> by William Golding</strong><br /></p> <p>“I don’t care what they call me, so long as they don’t call me what they used to call me in school.” Once confided, the dreaded name sticks all over again. Piggy: the fat, asthmatic boy with the glasses. Having been bullied all his life, he sees no glamour in being marooned on an island with a crowd of schoolboys, sole survivors of an air attack. “Nobody knows we’re here. Your dad don’t know, nobody don’t know,” he tells Ralph, the handsome leader-type whom he shrewdly latches on to. As the boys turn malevolent in the endless, unsupervised playtime, Piggy keeps a grip on reality that is far beyond his 12 years. His tragedy is that understanding can’t save him. </p> <p><strong>10. An anonymous student in Shyness and Dignity by Dag Solstad</strong><br /></p> <p>In recognition of all those pupils who changed the direction of my carefully planned lessons, I nominate as my final fictional schoolchild the faceless adolescent whose “aggressive, suppressed groan” in Elias Rukla’s Norwegian literature class stops the clock at page 43 of The Wild Duck and precipitates the beginning of the end of Herr Rukla’s life. This involves an umbrella and takes up the rest of Solstad’s wild and beautifully constructed novel. </p> <p>• Janet Davey’s latest novel is Another Mother’s Children (Chatto and Windus).

get asked which books I liked as a child. It’s a question that makes you think about your youth and the books you liked, and how they revealed your innate character, even though you weren’t aware of it at the time, helping to fashion the you you are now. <br /></p> <p>I liked the offbeat, the outlandish and the unconventional, which was telling. I liked playful language and absurd humour – also telling – and I loved travel: from the age of seven, I spent most nights losing myself and planning my future in the pages of a children’s encyclopaedia of the world. And because I liked all these things, my greatest fictional inspiration is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pippi-longstocking-6.html\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8200bc8f21fd85ba46b269c8bcefd36260587cb4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441797406695/2e3a1b24-0294-413d-8953-bc8fe0236979-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Emma Shevah\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Shevah: ‘Pippi has done what I longed to do’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I realise now that the child captivated by the atlas was hungry for freedom, adventure and independence, and Pippi, at nine years old, has it all. She’s financially sorted thanks to her bag of gold coins. She has a monkey that sits on her shoulder and a horse that lives in her porch. She’s free of humdrum routines like school and homework, and is completely self-sufficient. Thinking her mother looks down at her through a hole in heaven, Pippi waves and says, “Don’t worry. I can look after myself.” And she can.</p> <p>Notably, Pippi has done what I longed to do: she’s travelled the world and has a story to tell from each of the countries she’s visited. Not that you can believe any of them. Truth, like most things where she’s involved, is a little more adaptable than it is for the rest of us. After all, “how can you expect a little child whose mother is an angel and whose father is a Cannibal King and who has spent her life sailing the seas to tell the truth always?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a014eaab1f57b7d1b4c95dbe9cb8784bc60c9437\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441798102927/ba67c0bb-52c9-439a-a270-a5157d3729b9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Astrid Lindgren\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Astrid Lindgren, creator of Pippi Longstocking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To highlight Pippi’s nonconformity, Astrid Lindgren sets her in the world we know. Her friends, Tommy and Annika, are “very good and well-brought up and obedient”. They go to school, toe the line and respect authority figures. Pippi, on the other hand, is a little anarchist. </p> <p>What I didn’t realise then is that she’s also a feminist, an optimist and a free thinker. We could all do with being a little more like her. She doesn’t get angry or offended even when she’s insulted. She’s happy with who she is and what she looks like. It’s not awful but “really rather nice” that she doesn’t have parents because there’s “no one to tell her to go to bed just when she’s having the most fun and no one to make her take cod liver oils when she felt like eating peppermints”. She’s generous, champions the downtrodden and amuses her sick friends by doing acrobatics at their window, hugging them and even the wrapping paper when they give her a present. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jun/02/the-10-best-pippi-longstocking-quotes\">The 10 best Pippi Longstocking quotes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When she does go to school, it’s only so she too can experience the holidays, but she can’t meet up at eight because she “can’t start <em>that</em> early”. She leaves home at ten on her horse, gallops wildly into schoolyard, ties him up and crashes into the classroom where – in typical good humour – she challenges the teacher, then draws on the floor because it’s a picture of a horse and it won’t fit on her piece of paper. </p> <p>And that’s Pippi. She can’t be confined to a small space – not on paper and not in life because her worldview is bigger than that. Nothing fazes her - not being on her own, not ghosts, and not authority figures trying to make her something she isn’t. She’s strong, yes: she can carry her horse and throw sharks around, but her strength lies deeper than that. She has an unshakeable sense of well being, her own take on the world and an enthusiasm for life that’s infectious. </p> <p>So when Tommy says, “You really can’t be certain about anything when it comes to Pippi!” he nails what I loved best about her. In a world of expectations, rules and responsibilities, Pippi - with wit and charm - embodies freedom, originality and the unexpected. As a child, I aspired to be just like her. And, to tell you the truth, I still do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7765e2ccc329bc0f33f1dcc5bd14c1f34e4db96c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441796651325/aca96f21-c028-4e56-ac50-f2322c9deab8-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Dara\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Emma Shevah’s first novel, Dream on, Amber was published by Chicken House in March 2014.

Lacks biographer Rebecca Skloot responds to US parent over 'porn'

href=\"http://rebeccaskloot.com/\">Rebecca Skloot</a> has hit back at a Tennessee parent who is trying to have her acclaimed biography of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/07/henrietta-lacks-hela-cells-research\">Henrietta Lacks</a> removed from local schools, saying the complainant is confusing “gynaecology with pornography”.</p> <p>Knoxville <a href=\"http://www.wbir.com/story/news/local/2015/09/07/local-mom-objects--controversial-book--summer-reading-list/71843596/\">news station WBIR reported that</a> Jackie Sims, the mother of a 15-year-old boy at Knox County Schools’ L&amp;N Stem Academy, had objected to Skloot’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/life-henrietta-lacks-rebecca-skloot\">The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</a> when he brought it home as part of his summer reading. Her son has now been assigned a different text, but Sims is attempting to get Skloot’s biography of the African-American whose cancer cells – taken from her without her knowledge and which subsequently changed modern medicine – pulled from all Knox County schools.</p> <p>“I consider the book pornographic,” Sims told WBIR, citing a passage in which Skloot imagines Lacks discovering a lump in her cervix: “With the door closed to her children, husband, and cousins, Henrietta slid a finger inside herself and rubbed it across her cervix until she found what she somehow knew she’d find: a hard lump, deep inside, as though someone had lodged a marble just to the left of the opening to her womb”. Sims also objected to a passage about Lacks’ husband’s infidelity.</p> <p>“It could be told in a different way,” Sims said. “There’s so many ways to say things without being that graphic in nature, and that’s the problem I have with this book ... I was shocked that there was so much graphic information in the book.”</p> <p>Skloot, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rebeccaskloot/posts/10153206597394016\">writing on Facebook</a>, said that “Just in time for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/texas-school-bans-books-in-banned-books-week\">Banned Books Week</a>,” a US-wide celebration of the right to read which takes place at the end of the month, “a parent in Tennessee has confused gynaecology with pornography and is trying to get my book banned from the Knoxville high school system”.</p> <p>Skloot pointed to the “many other local parents” who disagree with Sims, and to the “other schools throughout the US” who support her biography, saying: “I choose to focus on those stories, and I hope the students of Knoxville will be able to continue to learn about Henrietta and the important lessons her story can teach them. Because my book is many things: It’s a story of race and medicine, bioethics, science illiteracy, the importance of education and equality and science and so much more. But it is not anything resembling pornography.”</p> <p>Reviewing the book for the Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/life-henrietta-lacks-rebecca-skloot\">novelist Hilary Mantel wrote</a>: “Rebecca Skloot revivifies Henrietta, studying her not only as the originator of her cell line but as a woman embedded in history. Her absorbing book is not just about medicine and science but about colour, race, class, superstition and enlightenment, about the painful, transfixing romance of being American.”</p> <p>Skloot was later contacted on Facebook by Jimm Allen, assistant principal of the school attended by Sim’s son, who told her: “Know that the book and teachers have the complete support from the administration of the school. It’s an amazing book that fits with our Stem curriculum better than almost any book could. The next book that the sophomores are reading? Fahrenheit 451... Oh, sweet, sweet, irony.”</p> <p>Ray Bradbury’s dystopian novel about a world in which books are burned has been the subject of repeated attempts to ban it since it was published in 1953. “I keep

Hollywood has had mixed success with adapting Scandi crime novels so far: Sony’s English-language, David Fincher-directed and Daniel Craig-led remake of Sweden’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, based on the hugely popular Stieg Larsson novel, scored a decent $232.6m worldwide in 2011 on the back of strong reviews, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/29/is-the-hollywood-remake-dead\">nevertheless failed to spark an expected sequel</a>.</p> <p>Swedish director Alfredson is also known for the icy 2008 horror Let the Right One In. His adaptation of John le Carré’s cold-war spy novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy saw star Gary Oldman pick up an Oscar nomination for his role as taciturn British intelligence agent George Smiley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/29/is-the-hollywood-remake-dead\">Is the Hollywood remake dead?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fassbender is expected to be part of the awards season conversation for his turn in the Danny Boyle-directed biopic Steve Jobs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/steve-jobs-movie-review-michael-fassbender-telluride\">currently at the Telluride film festival</a>, where it screened at the weekend.

A purr of self-satisfaction rises from every page of this sugary little novel from bestselling French author Grégoire Delacourt. It’s a quirkily supercilious meditation on Hollywood celebrity. It’s a tiringly unconvincing love story. But most of all it’s a freedom of speech issue. Because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/27/novel-scarlett-johannson-wanted-banned-english-the-first-thing-you-see-gregoire-delacourt\" title=\"\">Hollywood film star Scarlett Johansson has tried and failed to get a legal ban</a> on its English translation.</p> <p>The story, translated by Anthea Bell, concerns Arthur, a handsome yet modest young car mechanic with no girlfriend and an awful tragedy in his family background. One morning he opens his front door and the first thing he sees is – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\" title=\"\">Scarlett Johansson</a>! Her luscious husky-voiced sexiness is unmistakable, though she seems tired and troubled, with a weird tale to tell about just having come from the Dinard film festival.</p> <p>She wants to hang out with Arthur, apparently charmed by a glimpse she had of him being nice to a sweet little girl. Dazzled though he is by this glorious situation, Arthur senses something is amiss, because – and here is the whole ostensible point of the novel and the reason why Johansson’s legal action largely failed – it turns out to not be Johansson at all. She is a young woman called Jeanine Foucamprez who has been imprisoned by fate in a face and body that looks exactly like Johansson’s. If this sounds enviable, it isn’t. Though desirable, Foucamprez is desired by men who can’t get over her Scarlett-ness; she has no desire to be a professional look-alike and no identity of her own. The only identity available to her is that of Johansson, and that is already taken. As their relationship develops (he looks a bit like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling\" title=\"\">Ryan Gosling</a>, incidentally), Foucamprez hopes that real love will free her from this 21st-century identity crisis.</p> <p>The author all too clearly had his eye on a juicy movie deal for this high-concept romp – he even has a romcom-type “montage” of happy memories just before the end – and I suspect he hoped that Johansson would be a good sport and play Foucamprez herself. A film version is, after all, effectively impossible without her. Presumably the actor suspected this as well, and it contributed to her intense irritation at the way the author was presuming to make free with her identity, reputation and prestige as some kind of jokey avatar.</p> <p>Movie stars from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/charliechaplin\" title=\"\">Chaplin</a> to Dietrich have been dragooned into literary cameos before. And this would have been a neat idea for an ironic short story, with its gruesome touches and final Ballardian flourish. But Delacourt wants us to sign up for a romantic novel, and he will keep trying to have his cake and eat it by making lots of pop-culture movie references, sprinkling a little postmodern stardust on his prose while inviting readers to smile knowingly at the absurdity of Hollywood celebrity culture and establishing his literary bona fides with incessant highbrow references to the poet <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/jean-follain\" title=\"\">Jean Follain</a>.</p> <p>Weirdly, despite the blizzard of filmic namechecks, Delacourt doesn’t mention the specific films that must have influenced him: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/notting-hill\" title=\"\"><em>Notting Hill</em></a>, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/juliaroberts\" title=\"\">Julia Roberts</a>’s movie star falls for humble bookshop owner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/hugh-grant\" title=\"\">Hugh Grant</a> (incidentally, there’s a gag in <em>Ocean’s Twelve</em> about Roberts’s character passing herself off as Julia Roberts) and Jonathan Glazer’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/15/scarlett-johansson-under-skin-extraterrestrial\" title=\"\"><em>Under The Skin</em></a>, with Johansson playing an alien in Glasgow, in which the star filmed sequences with unwitting members of the public.</p> <p>By accident or design, Delacourt invokes interesting ideas, such as the loneliness involved in having beauty or celebrity, as well as the torment of those without them. “You don’t understand the misfortune of ugly women who know themselves to be beautiful,” says Foucamprez. But genuinely beautiful women and men have a refined misfortune of their own. They experience the same kind of power accorded to the well-known; people find themselves liking them without quite knowing why, and their views are listened to with unmerited respect. (A male celebrity once told me that his growing fame made him feel like a woman who was getting increasingly younger and more beautiful.) Yet the surfaces of celebrity and physical beauty are of limited interest: they are the first thing this novel wants to see – and the only thing. The book doesn’t offer us anything much, other than a brush with ersatz fame.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em>The First Thing You See</em><strong> </strong>for £10.39 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285464/?utm_source=editoriallink  &amp;utm_medium=\" merch&amp;utm_campaign=\"article&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

I was once caught up in a superpod of 200 dusky dolphins off the coast of New Zealand. The sleek cetacean torpedos were zipping all around, and at one moment I turned to face two dozen of them charging directly at me. I thought I was about to be run down. But these animals can detect an object the thinness of a human fingernail at 20 yards. Effortlessly, they turned and swooped between my legs and under my arms.</p> <p>Only later, as I climbed, exhausted, out of the water, was I told by the naturalist on board that in fact my playmates were continually having sex around me. Dolphins can mate three times in five minutes – not only with their own, but with other dolphin species. They’ll even mount sharks and turtles in their search to satisfy their endless libido. Surely only an animal with a lot of quality time on their flippers – being extremely efficient predators, highly social and intelligent – could have evolved such a lifestyle? And as such, shouldn’t they be the cynosure of our oceans, glorious role models for us, their land-bound cousins? Well, yes, and no.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/324780/\"><em>Voices in the Ocean</em></a>, written by Susan Casey, editor of Oprah Winfrey’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/09/oprah-winfrey-neoliberal-capitalist-thinkers\">O Magazine</a>, seems to be pitching for a TV series with its show-stopping opening scene of the author swimming with spinner dolphins off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/hawaii\">Hawaii</a>. Entranced by these acrobats, which spin in the air like cotton bodkins, Casey feels she has stumbled on “some ancient tribe” whose language she did not understand but who seem to be communicating with her. Subsequently, she joins the wonderfully named Joan Ocean and her dolphin cult on interactive courses entitled “Dolphins, Teleportation and Time Travel”. But what starts out as a feelgood, new-agey account darkens like the sunlight diminishing in the deep, subtly turning into a devastating chronicle of one of the most egregious mismatches in natural-human history. The result is a brilliantly written and passionate book.</p> <p>The sorry tale of cetaceans in captivity begins with PT Barnum and his New York belugas, most of which died days after capture or, if they survived long enough, succumbed in fires in his Broadway emporia, boiled alive. The story resumes in Florida in the 1930s with the precursors of the modern-day oceanaria, but it wasn’t until the appearance of Flipper in his eponymous 1963 movie and later TV series that dolphin mania really took off. Even the New York Times was impressed: “The dolphin does amazing things. It registers pathos and joy in its own way, and manages to upstage anything less than 8ft long.”</p> <p>Part of the appeal was, and is, that perceived relationship between ourselves and these animals. The dolphin, so human-like in its physical scale and spirit, resembles a streamlined, happier version of ourselves, forever smiling. It’s why we like to believe in stories of dolphins “saving” people at sea. When surfer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsQeCO7jkFY\">Todd Endris</a> was bitten by a great white off Monterey, dolphins drove the shark away, formed a ring around Endris and escorted him back to the beach. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dick-van-dyke\">Dick Van Dyke</a> told how falling asleep on his surfboard, and drifting out of sight of land, he was pushed back to safety by dolphins (presumably real rather than Disney cartoons). But Casey points out that there is an instinctive reason for these “rescues”. Dolphin social structure means that if they see a single human, they automatically think it needs to be returned to its pod.</p> <p>In a mind-expanding meeting with Lori Merino, a neuroscientist, Casey explores that sociality. Merino explains that the dolphin brain has a complexity exceeding our own brains, with an incredible processing ability that powers their lightning-quick responses. Dolphins not only recognise themselves in the mirror, indicating an abstract sense of self, but also on film, in the way that only humans and higher primates can. Uniquely, their brains also have an extra lobe which relates to emotion; some scientists believe dolphins may be more emotionally mature than humans, observing moral codes as a result of living so close together. Exhibiting communal individuality, they exist as if their peers’ bodies, and brains, were extensions of their own.</p> <p>It is the implications of the notion that “the dolphin in the tank is not a what but a who” that renders their captivity unbearable, for us as well as them. As she investigates marine parks, Casey realises that neither visitors nor staff are able to put the animals into context. “The entire industry is built on the illusion that dolphins had somehow dropped from the sky.” When Casey asks an employee, “Where did these dolphins come from?”, she receives no sensible reply. Either they don’t know, or they don’t want to. At Connyland, a Swiss dolphinarium – the exquisite irony of a landlocked state hosting such a facility is eloquent enough – the inmates are subjected to incessant noise and flashing lights in what one scientist calls “a perversion of the highest degree”.</p> <p>Other captive dolphins beat themselves up – gnawing on cement enclosures, banging their heads against walls, eating stray bits of plastic litter purely out of mind-numbing boredom. Many are regularly dosed with Valium.</p> <p>Yet more disturbing are Casey’s reports from Taiji, in Japan, and the Solomon Islands, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/japanese-aquariums-vote-to-stop-buying-taiji-dolphins-hunt\">the source of many of these captives</a>. In Japan, the culls continue apace: 20,000 animals a year are driven into narrow rocky inlets and slaughtered. The majority are destined to be eaten – despite the fact that their flesh contains so much mercury (up to 5,000 times the recommended safety limit) that human ingestion can result in memory loss, nerve tremors “and a hellish syndrome called desquamation, which is basically your skin peeling off”.</p> <p>Perhaps the butchered animals are the lucky ones. A dead dolphin is worth $500; a live one can be sold for $150,000, if it can be trained – 10% of the Taiji cull ends up in oceanaria in Asia, Russia and Ukraine, bought by dealers “untroubled by the process of plucking that dolphin out of a pool of blood that contains the dead bodies of its entire family”. That violence seems transferable. Joining the protesters in Taiji – both westerners and Japanese – Casey is confronted by demure kimono-clad women who shout in her face, “Why don’t you die instead of dolphins?” In the Solomon Islands, where questioning their dolphin slaughter can result in actual bodily harm, she gets into even deeper water.</p> <p>The cultural intransigence – and human greed – of this story defies logical reasoning. Perhaps that’s the point. We forever anthropomorphise, investing animals with our sins, imposing our stories on theirs. Some of us want to eat dolphins, some of us want to swim with them. What dolphins themselves might want is not part of the equation. Given our inability to live with our own kind, you might not hold out a lot of hope for the way we continue to treat other species.

Dystopia after meeting Anthony Ergo at Yalc; I knew it would become a favourite as soon as he gave me a brief summary… Turns out I was absolutely right!!<br /></p> <p>Dystopia is Anthony’s Ergo debut novel and the first in what I imagine to be an outstanding series that explores the supernatural (ghosts, empaths and all sorts), history as well the geography of London. I would definitely suggest making yourself comfortable before you start Dystopia, as I can guarantee you will not be able to put it down.</p> <p>The story follows Sasha who, after uncovering her father’s secret, is exposed to the world of the supernatural. After a powerful entity named the hangman ghost puts Sasha’s father in hospital, she is forced to join forces with two fellow agents to destroy one of the biggest poltergeists in history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b2cf04663167d9a85f912267362740f7dba78384\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/25/1440517729201/3e3fe4c9-4577-4892-99f9-f83cee235681-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Dystopia\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The characters in Dystopia are very relatable - the main protagonist Sasha is an insecure, superstitious teenage girl whose thoughts I could definitely relate to at some point or another… I mean, which teenage girl hasn’t felt insecure or crushed hard on a guy before? I thought it was really cool that Sasha suffered from asthma (she suffers frequent asthma attacks throughout the story) and had these really obsessive supernatural beliefs; it made her different to most YA female protagonists.</p> <p>Sasha doubts herself often and I sometimes wondered whether it was because she was so used to being alone, as up until she uncovers her dad’s secret, they have quite a fractured relationship… Sasha is somewhat of an anti-heroine in the sense that she doesn’t necessarily adapt to her newly found responsibilities, it takes her a while to get used to the idea that she could be useful.</p> <p>Aaron… Aaron…Aaron, I finally have a new fictional crush and I am so happy. I have been crushing hard on Gat from We Were Liars for a while now but I am officially over it: Aaron is just everything I look for in a male protagonist. He was sarcastic, beautiful *I mean, in my head he is Alex Pettyfer x100* and caring… he was great and I love him and I’m rambling, so I am going to stop now before I lose it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The concept of the hangman ghost was really creepy, there were some embarrassing occasions that involved me, my duvet and a torch because I got too freaked out, but we will leave that story for another time. I loved that the hangman ghost was based on a real life executioner that operated in Britain many years ago and is actually regarded as one of the most infamous executioners in history. The clues to what he wanted from the characters and who he was were unravelled slowly, which was good because it meant that you were constantly at the edge of your seat, trying to work out his

Alex Gino, a middle grade novel just published in the UK, is making waves. Following Melissa, a transgender fourth grader who the world calls George, it covers everything from theatre to school bullies to a happy-tears-inducing relationship between Melissa and her best friend Kelly. But what is perhaps most revolutionary about the novel is the empathy through which it explores Melissa’s isolation and her frustration with not being seen for the girl she is.</p> <p>Alex Gino – a <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=genderqueer\">genderqueer</a> author, gardener, and <a href=\"http://weneeddiversebooks.org/\">We Need Diverse Books</a> member – has crafted an honest and ultimately hopeful novel that everyone needs to read. It is a much-needed addition to the realm of LGBTQ+ middle grade literature, and I was so pleased to be able to discuss the book with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mx_(title)\">Mx</a> Gino.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/aug/21/transgender-last-taboo-young-adult-teen-fiction-amnesty-takeover-2014\">Transgenderism: the last taboo of teen fiction?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>George is an incredible novel, and Melissa herself is a lovable, dynamic character. How much do the two of you have in common?</strong></p> <p>Well, we’re both trans, white, bad at sports, and grew up in New York. (I grew up in Staten Island; she lives an hour north of the city). We both want to be seen for who we are, and we both love Mario Kart! In other ways, we’re not all that similar. I knew I was different as a kid, but I could never have named my gender as clearly as Melissa knows for herself. Part of that is about the fact that I’m genderqueer. Another part is that Melissa was born into a different culture than I was, one in which she’s able to find the word transgender and what it means outside of an afternoon talk show brawl.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZStMI6x_i4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZStMI6x_i4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch this! Alex Gino made this video specially for Guardian children’s books.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Did you encounter any pushback from agents or editors because George features a trans protagonist? </strong></p> <p>Through a careful combination of research, timing and luck – no. I got in touch with my agent, Jennifer Laughran, because of her vocal advocacy for LGBT characters and stories in children’s literature, and my editor, David Levithan, is himself a trailblazer in the field of gay YA as the author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/boy-meets-boy.html\">Boy Meets Boy</a> and over a dozen other novels with modern queer content.</p> <p>Which is not to say that <a href=\"http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Cissexism\">cissexism</a> and transphobia aren’t as common in children’s literature as anywhere else, and there are probably plenty of agents and editors who would have passed on the work based on its subject matter. But there ARE also agents and editors out there looking for quality trans youth literature. It’s all about research.</p> <p>And timing. And luck. But look at me, repeating myself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/08/trans-teens-what-is-normal-anyway-lisa-williamson-lgbt\">Trans teens: What is 'normal' anyway?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>I often hear marginalized authors talk about the tendency to self-censor – to erase the diverse elements in a story in advance out of fear that keeping them would tank the book’s marketability. Did you ever experience this? If so, how did you combat it?</strong> </p> <p>I was never intending George to be marketable. I was just focused on telling the story I needed to see in the world, until I looked up and saw the distant wave coming closer, and I knew it was time to finish it up, take the plunge, and send it out into the world. </p> <p>As I’m working on my new project, which is more intersectional (involving issues of deafness, the Black Lives Matter movement, intergenerational strife and first crushes), I’m running into a new terrain of balancing the varying threads of the piece. I have to think carefully about when I’m representing a member of a group I’m part of and when I’m allying with those I care about.</p> <p><strong>Because no interview is complete without some book recommendations: are there any other middle grade novels with LGBTQ+ themes that you think everyone needs to read? </strong></p> <p>There’s <a href=\"http://amipolonsky.com/books/\">Gracefully Grayson</a> by Ami Polonsky, which is the only other trans MG novel I’m aware of from a mainstream publisher, and <a href=\"http://books.simonandschuster.com/Five-Six-Seven-Nate!/Tim-Federle/9781442446953\">5-6-7-Nate!</a> and its sequel by Tim Federle. Interestingly, we all play with the theme of being on stage as a way to try on identities and to reveal who we are. The queer MG field is small, very small, and in that sense I would say everyone has to read them. And I want and we need there to be more.</p> <p>I’m excited that both Kate Rain Hill and Arin Andrews put out autobiographies last year, though both are YA. Robin Talley also has a great genderqueer theme in her upcoming <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/353349/\">What We Left Behind</a> (also YA). And I’m going to go ahead and do it; I’m going to recommend a book for (gasp) grown-ups. It’s the only book for adults that I’ve read in the last year and a half; it’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285683/\">Redefining Realness</a> by Janet Mock, and it’s beautiful. Her words are so genuine, and she shares so deeply of herself without ever feeling exploitive. For adults, it’s a MUST. READ.</p> <p><strong>What would you like to see more of in the realm of trans kidlit?</strong><br /></p> <p>Trans voices telling trans stories. There is a layer of depth and truth that comes from people writing from inside their communities that can never be replicated by people outside it. Also, more intersectionality! More people of colour, more people with disabilities, more stories that reflect, respect and celebrate the range of people we are. And more stories with joy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/may/12/best-lgbt-books-children-teenagers-yas\">What are the best LGBT books for children, teenagers and YAs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Let’s close on a weird note.

Let’s put Anastasia Krupnik (Lois Lowry’s pre-teen character who was snarky before the rest of us knew it was cool) in Alice in Wonderland. It’s a play to those two librarians in the back of the room, but I want to see her “List of Things I HATE about This Place” and “Reasons a Worm Shouldn’t Sit On A Mushroom”.</p> <p><em><a

an ancient Aboriginal trail some 365km long links the snowy peaks of Targangal (now known as Mount Kosciuszko) with the turquoise waters of Bilgalera (Fisheries beach) in Twofold Bay, near the coastal town of Eden.</p> <p>Thought to be thousands of years old, the track, after decades of not being used, threatened to vanish from popular imagination like a line of faded ink.</p> <p>John Blay, 70, is the author of <a href=\"http://www.newsouthpublishing.com/articles/track-and-bundian-way/\">On Track: Searching Out the Bundian Way</a> and says once revived, it will become one of Australia’s great walks.</p> <p>Blay has been writing about south-east NSW for more than 30 years. There’s even a wattle that grows up to 25 metres high <a href=\"http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=wattle&amp;lvl=sp&amp;name=Acacia~blayana\">named after him</a> – he identified it on one of his many back-country adventures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29744c6a87d96c925a0f99567c1bf9d300a08e41\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/29744c6a87d96c925a0f99567c1bf9d300a08e41/0_0_764_1144/668.jpg\" alt=\"A typical pathway through Bydabo wilderness on the Bundian Way.\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A typical pathway through Byadbo wilderness on the Bundian Way.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Blay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This area of NSW is home to a number of Indigenous nations, including the Yuin, Ngarigo, Bidhawal and Monaro peoples. Friendships with members of those communities, including BJ Cruse, chairman of the Eden Aboriginal land council, tipped Blay off about a pathway linking the Monaro region to the coast.</p> <p>When Blay received a history research grant in 2001, his hunt for the Bundian Way began. Historical documents indicated parts of the track were surveyed in 1842, and in the following decades parts of it were used for travelling stock. </p> <p>“It was very well known back in the 1800s,” Blay says. But with the advent of cars and bitumen roads, the route fell out of popularity and was eventually forgotten.</p> <p>In 2003, exhausted by his search but sensing he was close, Blay stumbled across a lead that would break the case wide open. He met an old dingo trapper and horseman in his late 80s called Harold Farrell, living in the town of Bombala. <br /></p> <p>Blay asked Farrell if he had heard of the pathway. “Of course I have,” he replied. “I know it well, I used to use it.” Farrell pointed out exactly where it lay.</p> <p>“When I went out the next day that’s exactly where the route went,” Blay says.</p> <p>Having now completed the trail several times, Blay says walking it became a sort of “pilgrimage towards the old Australia”. Dotted with Aboriginal artefacts – worked bits of stone, axe heads and middens – the trail is an example of “Aboriginal landscape”, he says – something quite different to “settler landscape, where people look for grass for their sheep or cattle”.</p> <p>On his walks, Blay began to better read the natural environment, noticing how the plant life changed and recognising good camping spots, which he says were always the same places where Aboriginal people once camped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c3c4dedba3997d40068acab806804732948e57\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d1c3c4dedba3997d40068acab806804732948e57/0_341_2271_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At the end of summer, hundreds of thousands of Arabuls (little ravens) flock to the high country and feast on bogong moths.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At the end of summer, thousands of ravens flock to the high country and feast on bogong moths.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Blay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says in the summer, the track was used by Aboriginal people to ascend into high country and hunt for bogong moths, which line the granite walls “two or three inches thick, like carpet”. After being netted, the moths were thrown on to a charcoal bed, which burned the legs and wings off. “They’re a highly nutritious source of food,” Blay says.</p> <p>Has he eaten bogongs himself?</p> <p>“I have, they’re fantastic! Crunchy and delicious, like eating a roasted cashew nut,” he says.</p> <p>At the end of the cold season, says Blay, it was common to head to the coast for “great big feasts of whale meat”, as well as fish, lobster and abalone. There would be ceremonies “where they traded and met up with their friends and relatives”.</p> <p>In the decade that has passed, Blay has worked as a project officer for the Eden Aboriginal land council, developing the track for public use and working closely with Cruse and Cruse’s father, the Yuin-Monaro elder Ossie Cruse.</p> <p>“He’s been an amazing leader of this project,” says Blay of Ossie, and credits BJ with doing all the difficult “political work”. In 2010 the track was surveyed for modern use by a team of five Aboriginal people who walked its entire length. It was heritage listed three years later.</p> <p>A couple more years is needed before the track is ready for walkers and fitted with primitive campsites, says Blay, although a 12km stretch along the Twofold Bay foreshore complete with scenic viewing platforms is due to open in six months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f03fa9f8ac6666995d356e8092d67d1be0a250b7\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f03fa9f8ac6666995d356e8092d67d1be0a250b7/0_30_1349_810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Blay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Blay, the author of On Track: Searching Out the Bundian Way.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blay says it is Aboriginal people doing the development work, among them inmates from NSW jails that find the work “inspiring”. Once complete the track will be an opportunity for visitors to learn about Aboriginal Australia. </p> <p>“We’ll have signage, a guidebook and app,” he says, adding that there will also be an art gallery.</p> <p>The Bundian Way project runs a three-day camp for Aboriginal children called Getting Back to Country. Ossie told the <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2015/07/30/4284097.htm\">ABC</a>: “A lot of our kids are damaged because they haven’t had the opportunity to live the kind of culture they need to live and that damage will be repaired on the Bundian Way.”</p> <p>Blay says during his time on the Bundian Way, which even in the wildest of back-country looks like any other dirt track, he has spotted kangaroos, emus, snakes and a “beautiful little animal that lives close to the coast called the long-nosed potoroo”. </p> <p>Oh, and snakes. Lots of snakes. “But if you don’t hassle them they won’t hassle you,” Blay says. </p> <p>He expects most people will only walk sections of the trail at a time, but says walking its length – “from the highest part of the country to the coast” – is an incredible experience. “Every day you’d get an almost entirely different landscape ... you get to one end and you want to walk back to the other end again.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6c0bc53b7bd0b405961016e27f2c07af19b775d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a6c0bc53b7bd0b405961016e27f2c07af19b775d/0_1281_2078_1314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A map illustrating the Bundian Way.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A map of the Bundian Way.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: John Blay</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><em><a href=\"http://www.newsouthpublishing.com/articles/track-and-bundian-way/\">On Track: Searching Out the Bundian Way</a> is published by NewSouth Publishing. <a href=\"http://art-cass.anu.edu.au/newsstory/beyond-balawan-aesthetic-responses-bundian-way\">Beyond Balawan: Aesthetic Responses to the Bundian Way</a> is at Photospace Gallery, Australian National University School of Art until 11 September</em><em><em><em><br /></em></em></em></li> </ul>","productionOffice":"AUS","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Australia’s highest point – Mount Kosciuszko – links to coastal NSW via a 365km track filled with scenic views and Aboriginal heritage.

And judging from the reaction to my latest YouTube <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/sep/07/the-uk-is-finished-owen-jones-meets-peter-hitchens-video\">interview</a> of the Mail on Sunday’s rightwing firebrand, this is a guilty secret shared by others on the left. We share little common ground – he is a proponent of a deeply pessimistic (or “relaxed”, as he would put it) social conservatism – though there is a mutual support for rail renationalisation and distaste for the modern Tory party. Yet, for different reasons, we both find ourselves outside the political consensus that combines free-market economics with social liberalism.</p> <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of Hitchens is his political journey. A man who now regards the Conservative party as de facto socialist was once a godless Trotskyist, a member of the International Socialists (the forerunners of the Socialist Workers party), who were committed to the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a workers’ state.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/sep/07/the-uk-is-finished-owen-jones-meets-peter-hitchens-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4c6px\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2367010\"            data-video-name=\"'The UK is finished': Owen Jones meets Peter Hitchens – video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-55eda039e4b0e420d3ab04df\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/09/07/150907HitchensJones_KP-25221640_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/09/07/150907HitchensJones_KP-25221640_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/09/07/150907HitchensJones_KP-25221640.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/09/07/150907HitchensJones_KP-25221640_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/09/07/150907HitchensJones_KP-25221640_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption>Peter Hitchens and Owen Jones discuss Jeremy Corbyn’s surge in popularity.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This was no brief dalliance: Hitchens was a member for many years, leaving in his mid-20s. He now looks back at his political affiliation as akin to being infected with a disease. Trotskyism has never assumed power in any country – outside the eclectic collection of Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Bolivia, it has never really won mass support – but it did provide the intellectual training ground for a surprising number of rightwingers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jan/29/alan-milburn-labour-health-secretary-am-strategy-private-healthcare\">Company owned by Alan Milburn had £663,000 profit increase in 2013-14</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the United States, neoconservatism – a brand of rightwingery that Hitchens passionately rejects but with which his brother, the fellow ex-Trotskyist Christopher, flirted – was developed by many ex-Trots. Some of them were “red-diaper babies”, those born to leftists who had often fled to the US from tyranny.</p> <p>One such was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/20/irving-kristol-obituary\">Irving Kristol</a>, perhaps the intellectual founder of the neocons, who defined his movement as liberals who had “been mugged by reality”. Others were followers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Shachtman\">Max Shachtman</a>, who dramatically shifted to the right. Some were Democrats who felt they had not left the left, but rather the left had abandoned them: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/09/guardianobituaries.usa\">Jeane Kirkpatrick</a> was a US socialist who ended up as Ronald Reagan’s ambassador to the UN and an apologist for pro-American dictatorships. Then there was James Burnham, a revolutionary associate of Leon Trotsky’s, who became a conservative writer and was awarded the presidential medal of freedom by Reagan.</p> <p>There are countless examples in Britain too. Alan Milburn helped found New Labour, and now champions private healthcare firms: back in the day, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1871072.stm\">he was a Trotskyist activist</a> at a radical bookshop called Days of Hope (better known as Haze of Dope, for reasons you can probably guess). Peter Mandelson, prince of darkness, <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/matthewholehouse/100233969/vladimir-putins-got-a-friend-in-peter-mandelson/\">fan of Putin</a> and champion of big business, was once in the Young Communist League.</p> <p>The Tory MP Eric Pickles is known for hammering local authorities – disproportionately in poorer areas – but <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/6630468/Eric-Pickles-admits-Communist-past.html\">he was once a communist too</a>. There are softer examples: Melanie Phillips might now think Obama is closely linked “<a href=\"http://phillipsblog.dailymail.co.uk/2012/11/america-goes-into-the-darkness.html\">to people with a history of thuggish, far-left, black power, Jew-bashing, west-hating politics</a>”, but she was once the liberal-left social services correspondent of this newspaper.</p> <p>It is often put to me that this is my inevitable trajectory. The leftist naivety of my earlier years will ultimately give way to hardened, real-world rightwingery, so the story goes. Those who leave the left are often those who end up detesting it more: becoming a convert often means being more zealous than existing believers.</p> <p>It is held that the one thing that remains constant is the fanaticism, even if the specific beliefs are subject to change. This mischievous prediction on the right is often matched on the left. Aware of the precedents I list above, the left is often suspicious of those tiny few with a mainstream platform. It can be seen as a sign of careerism and self-aggrandisement: any political disagreement evidence of bad faith.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Swimming against the tide is exhausting. If you acquiesce, you are lauded as ‘mature’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some on the free-market right were ideologically committed long before it was fashionable, and can claim to be pioneers. Others hailed from the left and shifted rightwards to varying degrees. You can see how this trajectory can happen. For the first few decades after the second world war, it seemed as though the left was on the advance. Back then it was the ardent supporters of the free market who were the fringe elements apparently damned by the onward march of history. Since the late 1970s, that process has reversed.</p> <p>Swimming against a strong tide is exhausting. Life is easier if you acquiesce: you are lauded as “grownup”, “mature”, “nuanced”. If you reject the status quo and work in the mainstream media or politics, you are inevitably mocked. Yes, there is currently growing discontent with the free-market order across the western world, that occasionally bubbles to the surface; but any advances are uneven, subject to reverses or at risk of being swatted like insects by global capitalism.</p> <p>To remain rooted in a movement and the struggles and campaigns of people fighting for social justice is probably the best insurance policy. To join others who dissent from the status quo would also help, breaking our isolation. The political winds will one day undoubtedly shift, and what now seems radical will become mainstream. Let’s hope so, anyway. Otherwise the left is just training up the rightwing firebrands of the future. A frightening thought.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"The Tory firebrand was once a Trotskyite.

forced on me. In 1982 I had packed my suitcase to return home from a London book launch when I learnt that the then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/opinion/a-dictators-last-laugh.html\" title=\"\">Moi dictatorship in Kenya planned to eliminate me</a>, euphemistically described as giving me a red-carpet welcome at the airport. At first I would only use the word shipwrecked, not exile, to refer to my situation; shipwrecks end with rescue, right? I did not unpack the suitcase. Seven years later the suitcase was still packed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview13\">Maya Jaggi interviews Ngugi wa Thiong'o</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I carried it to America when in 1989 I accepted a visiting professorship at Yale University. For three years I resisted offers to turn my regular visiting status into a tenured position. It was only when I finally accepted an offer from New York University as professor of comparative literature and performance studies that I unpacked the suitcase. I soon realised that it was replaced by a packed suitcase in the mind.</p> <p>I should have felt at home in New York. I met my wife, Njeeri, there and started a second family, assuaging the loss of my mother and my first wife. The city also carried an older memory. It was where I had landed when I first visited the US in 1966 and walked in the streets of Harlem, the site of the famed renaissance that meant so much to African writers of my generation. I worked at NYU for 10 years before moving to UC Irvine. I had accepted my exile status. But the suitcase in the mind would not let me just settle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>All my fiction is based in Kenya, and yet all but one have been written away from the country</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Exile is more than separation: it is longing for home, exaggerating its virtues with every encounter with inconvenience. It’s worse for a third-world passport holder in the west, where one becomes a travelling paradox. In 1992, coming back to America from Japan, my wife, Kenyan-born but now holder of an American passport, was welcomed home. My green card not withstanding, I was held at the immigration barrier, and Njeeri had to run back to vouch for me. This was before 9/11, when such a gesture was possible.</p> <p>Three years ago my 17-year-old son, Thiongo Kimathi, and I went to Berlin for the celebration of the German translation of my novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview21\" title=\"\">Wizard of the Crow</a>. His American passport got him through without a question. My Kenyan passport had me stopped and questioned. My son intervened with all the authority of his American accent and passport. The official looked at me suspiciously as if I had kidnapped the American boy, flung my Kenyan passport at me, and warned me not to stay one hour beyond the three days prescribed in the visa. I would be treated as an illegal immigrant.</p> <p>Exile can also turn one into a writing paradox, or rather deepen it. I have lived in America for more than 20 years, teaching in several campuses. I am member of the American Academies of <a href=\"http://www.artsandletters.org/\" title=\"\">Arts and Letters</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amacad.org/\" title=\"\">Arts and Sciences</a>. My novel Wizard of the Crow won the 2006 California Commonwealth club gold medal. Four of my 10 honorary doctorates are from American universities. But I have never written about America, the beautiful or the ugly or the mixture. All my fiction is based in Kenya, and yet all but one have been written away from the country. The exception was written inside a maximum security prison.</p> <p>What’s the pull of home? I must have been about 10 in colonial Kenya when I saw men, women and children in a convoy of barbed-wired lorries being forcibly relocated from their lands to make room for white settlers. They sang a sorrowful melody, but one that described their love and solidarity in hardship: even when they picked a morsel from the ground they split it among themselves. It was an image that captured vividly the ideals of mutual care and collective hope in the anti-colonial resistance. In my first ever trip to Europe in 1965, virtually the entire village saw me off at the airport. They said: You must return home.</p> <p>I did return, after my years at Leeds university, only to find myself packing my bags in 1969, for a two year self-exile in Makerere and Northwestern universities, returning to Kenya in 1972 only to end up in maximum-security detention five years later, and then in forced exile.</p> <p>In 2003 I went home after 20 years to celebrate a new democracy following the electoral defeat of the Moi dictatorship. I was going to mark the formal end of my exile with the launch of the Gikuyu edition of Wizard of the Crow. Eleven days after our arrival, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3569480.stm\" title=\"\">my wife and I were brutally attacked</a> by four armed gunmen. We escaped with our lives, barely.</p> <p>But I return again and again, in person, and in my writing, for the same reason that I have clung to my Kenyan passport, like a religious relic, that reminds me of the unfulfilled dream the caged men and women once sung about. It’s through their eyes that I have looked at the performance of the various postcolonial governments in Kenya.</p> <p>One day I will unpack the suitcase in the mind and write about America and Europe, but I hope I will still find inspiration from those caged men and women whose melody of defiance embodies the dreams of all those who dream to change the world for the empowerment of the least among us.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"In 1982 I fled the Kenyan dictatorship’s threats on my life.

For his wife, Elinor, Paul’s relief that their shared home has been damaged comes as more of a betrayal than the affair that follows once she is safely packed off to the countryside. But for Paul the two events are connected because the bombing has removed ordinary restraint. “We are outside time,” he tells Elinor excitedly, when he sees that their clocks have been stopped by the blast.</p> <p>This is the third volume of Pat Barker’s latest trilogy, so Paul and Elinor are familiar figures to readers who have followed them since they were students at the Slade in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/15/fiction.features\"><em>Life Class</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/10/toby-room-pat-barker-review\"><em>Toby’s Room</em></a>. We’ve seen Paul fighting in the trenches and have watched Elinor grieving for her brother’s death in the first world war – a grief that resurfaces now as she faces loss once again.</p> <p>Celebrating the destruction of his home, Paul is also a familiar figure for anyone acquainted with the wartime escapades of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\">Graham Greene</a>, who expressed almost identical sentiments when his Clapham house was destroyed at a similar stage of the blitz. The parallels do not end there. Paul works as an ARP warden in exactly the same location as Greene, while Paul’s lover Sandra resembles Greene’s lover Dorothy in shape, age and temperament. Sandra shares Dorothy’s ability to down pints unusually speedily, and Paul and Sandra begin their affair, as Greene and Dorothy did, when they find themselves leaning out of opposite windows.</p> <p>Paul is not the only character to be modelled on a wartime writer in a novel that attempts to achieve authenticity by including actual experiences of the blitz. Elinor’s life owes something to that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/elizabeth-bowen\">Elizabeth Bowen</a> and much more to that of Rose Macaulay, with Elinor even using <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/virginiawoolf\">Virginia Woolf</a>’s portrayal of Macaulay as a “spindle-shanked withered virgin” as a description of herself. There is a scene depicting Elinor’s night on duty as an ambulance driver that exactly replicates one of Macaulay’s shifts. The smells, sounds and sights are the same, as are the interjections of the rescue workers and of the people trapped in the ruins.</p> <p>This is an interesting way to construct a historical novel. Readers may find that the documentary detail provides a reassuring accuracy of time and place; for me it sometimes made the characterisation rather flimsy. When Greene celebrated the bombing of his house he was welcoming the end of an already weary marriage and exhibiting a life-long enthusiasm for destruction. This was a man who had played Russian roulette with a loaded gun as a child, and repeatedly sought out danger in war zones, requiring the proximity to death to feel fully alive. Paul has exhibited none of these characteristics in previous novels, so his relief when his home is destroyed is as mystifying to the reader as it is to his wife.</p> <p>Readers in search of an evocative second world war novel might be better advised to return to the strange intensity of Bowen’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/12/100-best-novels-elizabeth-bowen-heat-of-the-day-blitz\"><em>The Heat of the Day</em></a> or the lyrical sensuality of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/24/classics.sebastianfaulks\">Henry Green</a>’s <em>Caught.</em> There are flashes of originality in Barker’s descriptions of the upstairs window of a burning house “wide open in the heat as if the house were gasping for breath” or of wartime London as “a settlement on a river, lit by guttering candles after dark”. More frequently, however, the novel becomes saturated by its historical detail.</p> <p>Although written in insistently colloquial, free indirect discourse, the stream of consciousness and even the diary entries of the characters frequently include documentary observations that no one would actually make to themselves. One character is attracted to the sound of a prostitute walking in the blackout “because they hammered tacks into the heels and toes, to make them stand out”. Elinor observes in her diary that the good thing about taking on work as a war artist is that “it’ll give me access to materials, and that’s no small thing, these days, because they’re getting awfully expensive”. And Barker’s plot is as strained as her descriptions, relying on a series of unlikely coincidences.</p> <p>As an art student in <em>Life Class</em>, Paul was informed by his tutor that “most people who come here are bursting with something they want to say” but that it was strangely unclear what Paul hoped to say through his paintings. Reading <em>Noonday</em>, I wondered if the same had become true for Barker. However, if this novel does have something to say then it is not about the blitz but about the rewards and complexity of middle-aged love.</p> <p>“Why should falling in love be reserved for the very young?” Bowen asked during the war. Barker’s novel might also lead us to ask why falling in love should be reserved for new lovers. It is moving watching Paul and Elinor losing and then refinding each other, slow and uncertain as they attempt to discover what is left of a marriage once its setting has been destroyed. This is love expressed not through clock-stopped sex but through the quiet warming of a tin of soup, through familiar bodies lying tentatively “side by side, not speaking, not even looking at each other, while the long hours of darkness passed”.</p> <p>• Lara Feigel is the author of <em>The Love-charm of Bombs: Restless Lives in the Second World War. </em>To order a copy for £15.19, go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/315633/?utm_source=editoriallink &amp;utm_medium=\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

A cold and lonely slice orphaned on a clunky white plate, surrounded by the detritus of gluttony – masticated olive pits, half-eaten crusts, a limp crescent of over-marinated capsicum. It’s destined for the bin, you would think, a sign of another satiated customer who crumpled their napkin and performed the internationally recognised hand gesture of an imaginary pen on paper that means “bring me the bill’’.<br /></p> <p>However. Consider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/aug/26/tipping-in-australia-what-are-the-rules-for-rewarding-waiters\">you’re a waiter.</a> You’ve just spent the past four hours serving food to thankless idiots after pulling a double shift the previous day with vodka-based refreshments to follow. You woke late, with only enough time to do the minimal gesture to social civility of the dry shower – a quick spritz of deodorant over yesterday’s clothes – before fronting up to work again. The gnaw in your stomach has gone from insistent to hostile. Blood-sugar levels have plummeted to dangerous lows yet to be fully understood by medical science. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/aug/26/tipping-in-australia-what-are-the-rules-for-rewarding-waiters\">Tipping in Australia: what are the rules for rewarding waiters?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You’re bottoming out. The law of diminishing returns means the odd cigarette break, snatched in the rear laneway on an upended milk crate, is no longer enough to quell the pangs of hunger. It’s still a full two-and-a-bit hours until staff meals will be ready, and anyway, the kitchen has been going through a phase where it lets the first-year apprentice experiment with his avant-garde food ideas as a sick joke on the waiters, regarded in this particular establishment (and in many others besides) as a sub-class of humans not unlike the Morlocks in HG Wells’ The Time Machine. Unbeknown to table six, lingering innocently over tira misu, there is a very real danger of this turning into a hostage situation. </p> <p>And there’s that pizza, abandoned on a table, ready to be collected and thrown in the bin without a second’s thought where it will fester among a decaying food gravy of scraps and offcuts and eventually make its way to a stinking landfill. Would you eat it? </p> <p>You spy your chance. The chefs are preoccupied by a spirited intellectual discussion (“Britney’s hot; Christina’s a dog, man’’), the floor manager has disappeared to places unknown, and there’s a blind spot near the dish pig where you’d be able to squeeze into a corner, between the bin and the ice machine, and stuff that bad boy down without too much trouble.</p> <p>Let’s call it Il Crappo Italiano. One of those restaurants doing for the reputation of Italian food what the captain of the Costa Concordia did for cruise liners. Forget the nation’s proud regionalism, its produce obsession, its Denominazione di Origine Protetta swagger. Il Crappo is a swamp, a veritable red-sauce sea of shoddy ingredients with red-and-white-checked tablecloths and, for that extra frisson of Latin authenticity, candles jammed into Chianti bottles where they threaten to set fire to the raffia cage. You might have been there. If you haven’t, you’ve probably been to one of the thousands upon thousands of places exactly like it dotted across the world. You know them: there’s a spruiker out the front, bellowing about the “REAL, OAR-THEN-TIC ITALIAN FOOD’’ and screaming “CIAO BELLA!’’ in the face of every female under the age of 90 in the assumption that women need only be told they’re beautiful by a glib dude in a waistcoat to think “Goodness, I really feel like lasagne.”</p> <p>You don’t need experience to work at Il Crappo. Who sold you that idea? Sure, they advertised the job like this: “Fun, Energetic, Vibrant, Proactive, Experienced Waiter/Waitress Wanted for Quality Italian restaurant.” (“Hey, that’s me!’’ thinks the morose, lazy, dull, reactive dolt in desperate need of some quick coin to pay this month’s rent. “How do I convince them I’m their man?’’) But here’s the thing you will quickly realise. Il Crappo is bullshitting just as much as you are. Working here is the hospitality equivalent of going down the salt mines. They churn through staff here like a logger going at a Tasmanian old-growth forest. Six months is considered a damned good innings. You’ll either be fired or – better still – muster the self-respect to walk out and never return.</p> <p>Oysters were the big currency at this joint. They were the filthy lucre, sent back to the kitchen with such regularity they were obviously not the sparkling, ocean-fresh creatures of briny loveliness that are the mark of a truly great oyster. I know plenty of places where sending an oyster back to the kitchen would induce mass weeping and possibly ritual suicide from the chef who allowed them through quality control into the kitchen. Here it was a case of bottoms-up. </p> <p>Nino, the general manager, loved them. “Mio caro, come to papa!’’ he’d croon over the suspect bivalves, instead of actually doing his job and trotting out to ask the customers why they didn’t eat them. Nino was one of those guys who come in 52 flavours. A moody bastard, in other words. This was a man who, when asked by a plump female customer what the three-cheese gnocchi was like, replied: “The gnocchi is amazing, madam. But you are not the one who should be eating it.’’</p> <p>I couldn’t bring myself to eat the returned oysters, those rejected gobs of sea snot. But I ate the pizza, and the chips – chips being an authentic Italian staple invented by Garibaldi, if I remember my history correctly. No matter that those leftover chips could have been on the floor. They could have been sucked on by a toddler. They could have been coughed over, spat on, used as props in a reenactment of the Battle of the Somme, for all I know. But eat them I did. It was an early lesson in how quickly the standards of the group reset your personal compass.</p> <p>There were moments to make me question the wisdom of the herd. An entire table of 16 staged a dramatic walk-out one night. Just after their meals arrived they stood up en masse and left, leaving a table heaving with oysters and veal, spaghetti bolognese and eggplant parmigiana. Was it a political statement about bad Italian food? Was it performance art? Their cult-like silence was bewildering until the last person pointed to the culprit: a fat, brown cockroach baked into capricciosa pizza. It could have passed for an olive if it hadn’t been for the legs sticking feebly out of the congealed mire. </p> <p>I escaped a major bollocking that night when Antonio decided to go for the pizza chef instead, the hapless guy who’d let an unfortunate member of <em>Blatella Germanica</em>, the German cockroach, meet its maker in a wood-fired pizza oven. He was only my age, a skinny little thing, being verbally eviscerated by a 50-year-old man-mountain who stank of stale cigarettes. A hail of spit splattered his face as he cowered in his sauce-stained jacket. Behind him, in the blind spot between the bin and the ice machine, two waiters were shovelling down oysters as if their lives depended on it.</p> <p><em>Prick with a Fork by Larissa Dubecki is published by Allen&amp;Unwin and out now</em><br /></p>","productionOffice":"AUS","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Food critic Larissa Dubecki spent a decade working in some of Melbourne’s more unsavoury restaurants.

won the Commonwealth short story prize for a tale set on a nuclear base in China, which judges called “disconcerting” and “extraordinary”.</p> <p>Tel beat four shortlisted authors – Fijian Mary Rokonadravu, Nigerian Lesley Nneka Arimah, Indian Siddhartha Gigoo, and Kevin Jared Hosein from Trinidad and Tobago – to win the £5,000 award. The prize is for the best piece of unpublished short fiction by a writer from the 53 countries of the Commonwealth.</p> <p>Tel’s story, The Human Phonograph, sees a woman travel from 1969 Beijing to Qinghai province, and the remote nuclear base where her long-exiled husband works. “There is a photograph (it will not be made public till years later, after his death, and by then she will be back in Beijing) of scientists in identical suits raising their clenched left fists in a loyalty salute, on an open plain, under a bright sun,” writes the author. “He is third from the left, over-exposed. Posed, of course. In reality they would have been cowering in a shelter, plugs in their ears and goggles over their eyes, while the earth shuddered.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/commonwealth-short-story-prize-human-phonograph-by-jonathan-tel\">Commonwealth short story prize: The Human Phonograph by Jonathan Tel - short story</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story “ranges from the personal to the universal”, said the author and chair of judges Romesh Gunesekera, and “the resonances remained with the judges, long after the reading”. He called The Human Phonograph “a disconcerting, extraordinary story of an individual in search of independence and reassurance in a difficult world”.</p> <p>The Human Phonograph is extracted from a novel Tel is writing. Set in contemporary China, its 10 chapters are independent stories, but link together to form a novel. The first chapter of the novel, The Shoe King of Shanghai, was previously shortlisted for the Sunday Times EFG award.</p> <p>“The stories are all linked through an overarching plot, but this one is unusual in that it is entirely backstory, set in the 1960s,” said Tel. “I wanted to write about the Chinese equivalent of the Manhattan Project – it’s top secret, which for a fiction writer is great, because you can make stuff up.”</p> <p>Tel, who writes full time and who has spent “a lot of time in China”, has already published a novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/20/fiction.sigmundfreud\">Freud’s Alphabet</a>, and a short-story collection, The Beijing of Possibilities. He is now looking for a publisher for the novel in which The Human Phonograph is included.</p> <p>Gunesekera was joined on the judging panel for the <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthwriters.org\">award which is run by the Commonwealth Foundation</a> and part-funded by the Sigrid Rausing Trust by Leila Aboulela, Fred D’Aguiar, Marina Endicott, Witi Ihimaera and Bina Shah. Previous winners of the prize include Uganda’s Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi and New Zealander Emma Martin.</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"British writer beats

written a book about drugs. Sorry, Mum.<br /></p> <p>Right, now that’s out of the way, let’s move on to why I wrote it.<br /></p> <p>I was searching for the “real me” for a long time. When I was six years old, a teacher kept me in after school for not doing enough work. She shouted at me: furious, relentless, vein-popping, until my mum arrived. Other parents had alerted her and she rushed into the classroom. Vaguely I recall the dusty, rubbery air and the parquet flooring, but mainly I picture the teacher’s towering height (I was short for my age which can’t have helped) and I feel again the FEAR; my whole body, super-charged, shaking, the gallop of my heartbeat in my ears, my evaporating stomach, and the voice saying, “you’re not good enough.” That voice would eventually become my own, because, as far as I can remember, that was the moment that my angst-ridden, insomniac journey with depression and anxiety began. Only I didn’t know it yet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/01/top-10-teen-books-to-save-your-life-jennifer-niven\">Jennifer Niven's top 10 teen books to save your life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When I was seven years old at a new school, I cried all day, every day. When I was 14 years old, I cried in maths lessons. An improvement, I guess. It wasn’t that I was bad at maths; I knew my way around a quadratic equation, let me tell you. It was that I was bad at being at school. For me, the environment totally sucked because A) there were all these people who were obviously smarter/cooler/better than me; and B) every time I did or said anything, the voice was saying, “Stop that immediately! You’re not good enough! You’re a disgrace!”<br /></p> <p>Obviously, this is not a great way to be. So I tried to fix it. Which is hard, when you don’t understand the problem. I just wanted to feel better, to be happy. Maybe I could displace the feelings of inadequacy somehow? How about smoking? Or booze? Let’s try that… You see where this is going…<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jan/21/teenager-feminism-louise-o-neill-only-ever-yours\">Louise O'Neill: my journey to feminism</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/318573/\">Drop</a> is not the first book about teenage addiction; <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/junk.html\">Junk</a> by Melvin Burgess is the seminal YA novel about heroin addiction, there are multiple US books about meth: <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/crank.html\">Crank</a> by Ellen Hopkins, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tweak.html\">Tweak </a>by Nic Sheff are examples. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/go-ask-alice.html\">Go Ask Alice</a>, presented as the authentic diary of a troubled teen’s drug experience, later controversially exposed as a work of fiction, is a classic. Written in 1971, its message is still relevant, but nearly 45 years on, today’s teens risk finding the style outdated.<br /></p> <p>When it comes to drugs in fiction, we’re presented with extremes – heroin, meth and their sometimes horrific consequences are well documented. As much as we need these stories, what about the countless teens using party drugs? In hindsight it’s easy to say I was aiming to tell a story that’s relevant to them, but if that were the case, it was an unconscious doing. I just wanted to tell an honest story: highs, lows, warts and all. I wanted to write about a teen’s descent into drug use and it was natural to draw on first-hand experience of an overwhelming need to fix myself by any means.<br /></p> <p>In <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/318573/\">Drop</a>, Carla is desperate to belong, to be <em>someone</em>. But where do you draw the line? When do you become <em>someone</em>? Imagine: in the distance you see a tower. When you reach that tower, you believe you’ll be perfect. You eventually arrive, battered and bruised from the epic journey, and climb to the top to look out. Guess what? Ahead is another tower, one that was unobservable from your original starting point, so you pack up, and set out again on your quest for perfection. Guys, there is always another tower. Carla thinks being popular will solve all her problems. She’s so committed to changing herself, to reaching the next tower, that she refuses to acknowledge the damage it’s doing. Pressure, whether from peers or that you put upon yourself, is a fearsome motivator.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/28/banned-burned-or-simply-life-changing-what-are-the-best-dangerous-books\">Banned, burned, or simply life changing: what are the best dangerous books?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like me, Carla is shy, self-questioning – searching for that elusive, optimal version of herself, the princess atop the tower. But I know something she doesn’t: the “real me” is a phantom. It was only whilst editing <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/318573/\">Drop</a>, over 20 years after the “you’re not good enough” voice began whispering in my ear, that I realised I had a problem, and decided to get help. Twenty years! It’s not at all easy to break the habits of a lifetime – to challenge the FEAR, and quiet the voice – but instead of filling my face with booze or whatever, and with a lot of support, I’ve started to accept that A) I’ve done a pretty good job of life so far; and B) what other people think doesn’t really matter. Screw the tower. I’m going to have a nice little picnic down here on the grass with my friends and family, because they don’t care a jot whether I’m up there.</p> <p>Happiness rarely just happens. Mostly you make some choices and you\u001F\u001F\u001F\u001F work at it. You tell yourself that you <em>are</em> good enough. It’s hard at first, but eventually, you start to believe it. I was lost, looking for the real me just like Carla. And what I found was that I’m alright just the way I am. It’s a difficult lesson that perhaps I wish I’d learned sooner, but then, without angst as my companion all this time I never would have written <em>Drop</em>. Our flaws make us human and our stories real. (On that note: to the teacher from all those years ago – don’t sweat it. You had your faults and I have mine. I’m as much genes as experience, and in a way you helped me become who I am. What I’m trying to say is ... we’re cool. And you know what? I’m doing OK now.)<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s a fact that some teens do drugs. They’re not necessarily bad people; they’re regular people, led by experience to choose a certain path. In <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/318573/\">Drop</a>, Carla, by her own admission, is a normal sort of girl, a bit shy, a bit sad… As I said, a lot like me. It was very important to me that she be ordinary. Or at least perceive herself as ordinary. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/318573/\">Drop</a> could be anyone’s story, even younger teens’. It’s no wonder. Fierce expectations from educators; the massive mental and physical upheaval of being an adolescent; peer pressure, or simple curiosity can make drugs a tempting prospect. And let’s not forget, some drugs do make people feel good. You don’t have to come from a broken home or have a skeleton in your closet to feel drawn to take drugs. Sometimes it’s a just a simple quest to feel good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9dd8bf31a0ec2f33e03febae4ec2fb075712ed16\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/8/1441715912469/da238823-c929-4d7d-8ec7-3dfd569e57d9-274x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Drop\" width=\"274\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s hard growing up.

Lindgren told reporters he really enjoyed the book and hopes to get a copy of the film beamed up to orbit on 2 October, the day of release, or shortly thereafter.</p> <p>The astronauts chatted with the star of the film, Matt Damon, last month by phone. They called the actor – who portrays fictional astronaut Mark Watney, who is mistakenly left for dead on Mars – while he was touring the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.</p> <p>“That was a neat conversation,” Lindgren recalled during a space-to-ground news conference. “It was certainly fun for us.”</p> <p>Kelly – who is almost halfway through a yearlong space station stay – said it’s difficult to compare his experience in orbit with a Mars trip.</p> <p>“For the folks who go to Mars, especially the first time, it’s going to be such an incredible destination and event that they’re going to be really psyched up for getting there,” Kelly said. “I’m not saying I’m not psyched up for the rest of this. But in some ways, almost being halfway through, a lot of what we’re going to be doing is very similar to what we’ve already done.”</p> <p>A Mars crew also won’t have people coming and going, as is currently the case at the space station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dc1b0e36e6c08143b21049a7c299c37026958d5\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3dc1b0e36e6c08143b21049a7c299c37026958d5/0_0_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen of the Russian Mission Control Center shows live television of the International Space Station crew members as they take part in the news conference on Tuesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen of the Russian mission control centre shows live television of the International Space Station crew members during a news conference on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxim Shipenkov/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nine men from four countries are on board the orbiting lab until Friday, when three of them – representing Russia, Kazakhstan and Denmark – will return to Earth.</p> <p>Kelly and Russian Mikhail Kornienko will remain there until next March. For Nasa, it will represent the longest space mission ever. Nasa officials consider the year-long mission a necessary step as the agency looks ahead to even longer Mars expeditions sometime in the 2030s.</p> <p>With its sights set on the red planet, Nasa is embracing The Martian – and vice versa.</p> <p>Like Kelly, Damon recently signed up to have his name sent to Mars aboard Nasa’s next lander, named InSight. The spacecraft is due to launch next March and arrive at Mars next September. Posing with his “boarding pass” to the red planet, Kelly noted in a tweet over the weekend that in the time he has already spent in orbit, he would be almost to Mars. He and Kornienko took off from Kazakhstan in March.</p> <p>Nasa’s “boarding passes” to Mars, via the InSight lander, were available online until 11.59pm ET on Tuesday. As of noon, the sign-up sheet exceeded 765,000.</p>","productionOffice":"US","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"US crew are on board International Space Station as part of a year-long mission seen

blood. Red or Sliver. Poverty or power. Destined for battle or destined for greatness. Seventeen-year-old Mare is one of the unlucky ones. With no apprenticeship, she accepts the reality that she is going to follow her three older brothers into the war.<br /></p> <p>Suddenly, her world becomes a distorted map of lies. The king and queen - both Silvers - discover that Mare may be a threat to their kingdom because she possesses an ability. A superhuman power that only Silvers are meant to have authority over. Dressed up to play the part of a long-lost princess, Mare realises that anyone can betray anyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6d405c894753002cd65a425db6eef8a763dda417\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/8/26/1440583584476/2cf0dc8c-a20a-42ca-8925-eca1346051d5-276x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Red Queen\" width=\"276\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After reading some glowing reviews about this book, I had high expectations.

Russell Brown obituary","references":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-09-09T13:56:43Z","fields":{"wordcount":"897","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4c8ft","liveBloggingNow":"false","body":"<p>John Russell Brown, who has died aged 91, was a distinguished Shakespearean scholar who was also involved in practical theatre – he was a close associate of the director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/peter-hall\" title=\"\">Peter Hall</a> at the National Theatre for 15 years from 1973 – but was paradoxically opposed to directors filtering the plays though their own ideas, concepts and interpretations.</p> <p>In one of his many books, Free Shakespeare (1974), he advocated the primacy of Shakespeare’s musical language in contemporary production, the aspiration of an Elizabethan style of spontaneity in performance, and unostentatious decor. He seemed not to see the irony in adopting so idealistic and conceptual an approach himself; his advocacy turned Hall into a reformed classicist and led to austere and unexciting NT productions of Hamlet and Macbeth, both starring Albert Finney, in 1976 and 1978.</p> <p>At least he was consistent, seeing no division at all between his response to Shakespeare when he read the plays, taught them in a classroom, saw them in performance, or worked on them in the theatre. As well as his books on Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies and dramatic style, he prepared new editions of The Merchant of Venice and of John Webster’s two masterpieces, The Duchess of Malfi and The White Devil, and directed productions of the plays in locations as various as Liverpool, Dunedin in New Zealand, and Seattle and Pittsburgh in the US.</p> <p>In his field, he was regarded as a pioneer; he took forward the work of <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_History_of_English_Drama_1660_1900.html?id=mgSZjOrtHZgC&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Allardyce Nicoll</a>, who in 1951 founded the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon with a view to working closely with Barry Jackson, who was then running the Shakespeare Festival in the Memorial Theatre in Stratford. This relationship between the academic world and the Royal Shakespeare Company – exemplified in the career of Russell Brown’s friend and successor, <a href=\"http://stanleywells.co.uk\" title=\"\">Stanley Wells</a>, who became a governor and vice-chairman of the RSC – has varied in intensity but is undergoing a renewal in Gregory Doran’s artistic directorship. The Nicoll revolution was to consider Shakespeare not just as text, but as text in performance.</p> <p>Russell Brown’s scholarly articles in publications such as Shakespeare Survey, Critical Quarterly and the Tulane Drama Review were always worth reading. His 1957 book Shakespeare and His Comedies was one of the first to take the comedies seriously, and his more recent editions Directors’ Shakespeare (2008) and Actors’ Shakespeare (2011) – with essays by Wells on Judi Dench and Paul Edmondson on Harriet Walter – are essential documents of the contemporary theatre.</p> <p>He edited the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Oxford-Illustrated-History-Theatre/dp/0192854429\" title=\"\">Oxford Illustrated History of the Theatre</a> (2001), one of the outstanding books of its kind, with definitive essays by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/feb/27/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Martin Esslin</a> (on modern theatre 1890-1920), Peter Holland (18th century), Oliver Taplin (Greek theatre) and Peter Thomson (English Renaissance and Restoration drama), Russell Brown himself providing a magisterial, international overview of theatre since 1970. Unlike many Shakespearean scholars, he kept up to date, supporting Hall in his championing of Edward Bond, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/howard-brenton-life-in-theatre\" title=\"\">Howard Brenton</a> and David Hare at the National, and he remained well informed on developments across Europe and in America and Japan.</p> <p>He was the second son of Russell Alan Brown, a first world war veteran and pork butcher, and his wife, Olive (nee Golding), a teacher. The family lived above the shop in Gloucester Road, Bristol, and the boys, David and John, were educated at Monkton Combe school, near Bath. David was destined for the church – he became, eventually, bishop of Guildford. John left school aged 15 and joined the family business but caught the theatre bug at seaside pier shows. When the second world war broke out in 1939, he joined the Fleet Air Arm and was transferred to Scotland, where he serviced pitfires and luckily avoided a posting on a ship that sank with all hands on board.</p> <p>After the war, he found his way to Keble College, Oxford, where he read English and tutored undergraduates in Anglo-Saxon, supervised by JRR Tolkien. His academic career started at the Shakespeare Institute, where he was a fellow (1951-55), followed by 10 years as an English lecturer at Birmingham University, becoming professor and head of drama and theatre arts at Birmingham from 1964 to 1971. Ever active, ever busy, he was professor of English at Sussex University (1971-82) during his time with Hall. When Richard Eyre succeeded Hall at the NT and appointed Nicholas Wright as his literary manager, Russell Brown concentrated on his writing and was professor of theatre at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1985-97).</p> <p>For Hall, he regarded himself as “a resident researcher and critic in search of plays that surprise me”, and he directed one or two of them himself, including Alegrio Alonso’s Crossing Niagara at the ICA in 1975, Peter Handke’s They Are Dying Out at the Young Vic in 1976 and Barry Collins’s Judgement in the NT’s Cottesloe in 1977, the last of these a searing monodrama for a cannibalistic Russian army officer, played by Ben Kingsley.</p> <p>Tall, affable, industrious and encouraging – and a keen gardener – Russell Brown represented the best of the scholar/practitioner/teacher tradition he helped establish in British theatre.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Hilary (nee Baker), whom he married in 1961 when she was a student of his at Birmingham, their three children, Jasper, Alice and Sophie, and nine grandchildren.</p> <p>• John Russell Brown, Shakespearean scholar and director, born 15 September 1923; died 25 August 2015</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Eminent Shakespearean scholar and theatre director who advocated the primacy of the playwright’s musical language in modern

It’s her party piece for the first science lesson. All is new.</p> <p> Like a spool in Samuel Beckett’s play Krapp’s Last Tape, school goes on interminably. Press rewind or fast forward and it’s still playing. Childhood, adolescence. Add in teaching and parenting for me. I no longer attend classes or assemblies. I rarely walk along a school corridor. But what is concealed intrigues me. Every schoolchild, real or fictional, is an insider with off-the-record information. Don’t trust guidelines on transparency. Parents are the last to know, as Lorna Parry in my new novel, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/320745/s/another-mother-s-son/\">Another Mother’s Son</a>, discovers.</p> <p> Six of the children in my top 10 go on to become adult; the others are kept behind in class for ever.</p> <p><strong>1. James Steerforth in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/30/david-copperfield-dickens-100-best-novels\">David Copperfield</a> by Charles Dickens</strong><br /></p> <p>I have always fancied Steerforth, who is in control and outward looking. The character is in the name, but not wholly: ennui hangs about this charmer. The boys of Salem House worship him and cane-happy Mr Creakle dares not lay a hand on him. He has insomnia. His mind is not as quiet as it might be for a star pupil. This adds to the interest. One wet Saturday, the boys go berserk: hapless Mr Mells is demolished by Steerforth – and dismissed. The episode leaves a vile taste. DC joins in three cheers as Mr Creakle warmly shakes Steerforth’s hand. If Dickens reappeared in the 21st century, he would have an instant understanding of approval ratings.</p> <p><strong>2. Nanda Grey in Frost in May by Antonia White</strong><br /></p> <p>To the usual claustrophobia of school, add the Roman Catholic church. Nanda is in the Convent of the Five Wounds. She is new to the faith, and her unshakable outsider status makes her hyperattentive to the bells, smells and mind-boggling tales told by the nuns. Her friends, cradle Catholics of grand European families, reveal exotic home lives. Nanda feels dull in comparison. The novel she writes in the infirmary during a bout of measles falls into Mother Radcliffe’s hands. Nanda’s romantic creation does not find favour. In the closed world of the beautiful and the barmy, some fictions are more acceptable than others. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/27/top-10-unlikely-friendships-alex-hourston\">Top 10 unlikely friendships in fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>3. Kenneth Widmerpool in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/03/question-of-upbringing-anthony-powell\">A Question of Upbringing</a> by Anthony Powell</strong><br /></p> <p>Kenneth Widmerpool is defined at the outset by the wrong kind of overcoat. His first appearance, as he hobbles through a misty Thames Valley on the way back from a solitary run, sets the tone. His more savvy contemporaries see him as pompous, but Powell’s 12-novel cycle gives this academic and sporting nonentity if not the last laugh, then at least the scope to turn into a mild success in worldly terms. With his thick lips and metal-rimmed spectacles, he’s no one’s friend, but continues to crop up – as Etonians do. The slavishness and absence of imagination that made him a joke at school turn out to be just the ticket with the English establishment. Who would have guessed?<br /></p> <p><strong>4. Sandy Stranger in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/23/100-best-novels-the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie-muriel-spark\">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</a> by Muriel Spark</strong><br /></p> <p>Up to Edinburgh and to Miss Brodie’s special set at Marcia Blaine School. I’ve picked Sandy Stranger, with her “little screwed-up eyes” and immaculate enunciation. All five girls are mesmerised by their charismatic teacher but Stranger alone has the cross-examining skills to whittle out facts. Extracurricular study of the Sunday newspapers gives her insight into adult impurity and helps reveal the truth of Miss Brodie’s relations with Mr Lloyd, the art master (vicarious), and Mr Lowther the music master (real but unsatisfying). The uncovering brings diminishment: sadness as well as pleasure. Through Spark’s glorious technical feat of interleaving the past with the future, we discover what becomes of them all. Sandy Stranger takes holy orders.<br /></p> <p><strong>5. Charles Fox in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/young-desire-it.html\">The Young Desire It</a> by Kenneth Mackenzie</strong><br /></p> <p>The temperature is hotter for Charles Fox, and not just because his boarding school is in western Australia. I have lost Spark’s cool stare and am pressed against boys. “The folding doors were closed; the classroom was half its previous size” when they assault fourteen-year-old Charles on a table to check if he’s a girl. Penworth, a young classics master fresh out of Oxford and 10,000 miles from home, also spots his beauty. The befriending that follows consoles and repels. Embarrassment, rage, frustration, bewilderment all occur, as in adult life, but at a slower pace, drawn out over long days. Trapped for several years in this outpost of Englishness, Charles yearns for freedom – the “it” of the title.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ecec843c006acd2aa4c66bbe86ce632aa85ddb6\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/8/1441718985209/5caec283-c3ff-40df-baf5-d7e52095c696-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Charlotte Gainsbourg in the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Eyre.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Gainsbourg in the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Eyre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Miramax</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>6. Jane Eyre in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/09/100-best-novels-jane-eyre\">Jane Eyre</a> by Charlotte Bront</strong><strong>ë</strong><br /></p> <p>“Send me to school soon, Mrs Reed, for I hate to live here.” This is said in defiance, because the plan is already in train. Jane is admirably direct. She is packed off to Lowood Institution for orphans. The long, mysterious journey to reach the place, the setting in a forest dell, a “fog-bed of pestilence”, Mr Brocklehurst, the evil benefactor, Miss Temple the good headmistress – these are fairytale ingredients, but Jane is her own person, alive and spontaneous. Her experience and witness of cruelty is sharp. Who could forget the episode when, having accidentally broken a slate, she is made to stand on a stool, while Brocklehurst publically humiliates her? Jane feels every sting but is not crushed.</p> <p><strong>7. Törless in The Confusions of Young Törless by Robert Musil</strong><br /></p> <p>At night, in the attic of a military academy, a boy is repeatedly tortured by two power-crazed schoolmates; a third, Törless, is drawn in and participates – up to a point. His equivocation is the hinge of the novel. Daytime reality of uninspired teaching and sensible letters from parents hints at a safer world but does little to offset the agonising. In asides and glimpses, Musil intimates that adulthood, like school, might be the same “everlasting waiting for something you don’t know anything about” – but with the senses more blunted. </p> <p><strong>8. Claudine in Claudine at School by Colette</strong><br /></p> <p>The child safeguarding team would be run off their feet in Montigny. The place squirms with inappropriate behaviour. Motherless Claudine, with her unworldly, mollusc-fixated Papa, chooses to attend the local elementary school rather than go off to a lycée or convent with the other middle-class daughters of the village. The girls stitch lingerie, the boys turn table legs. Claudine falls for Mademoiselle Lanthenay, but loses her to the predatory new headmistress who swiftly installs her in her bedroom. Far from crushed by the setback, Claudine spies, gossips, entertains her friends and wards off pervy bureaucrats. She educates herself at home in peace. School is for action. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfd8efa4cb48cf73b19096d350755cdb8ee8293c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441799120399/4f55e3cb-2524-4dad-bc84-13216c461926-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hugh Edwards as Piggy (right) in the 1963 film of Lord of the Flies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Edwards as Piggy (right) in the 1963 film of Lord of the Flies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>9. Piggy in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/16/lord-of-the-flies-100-greatest-novels-william-golding-mccrum\">Lord of the Flies</a> by William Golding</strong><br /></p> <p>“I don’t care what they call me, so long as they don’t call me what they used to call me in school.” Once confided, the dreaded name sticks all over again. Piggy: the fat, asthmatic boy with the glasses. Having been bullied all his life, he sees no glamour in being marooned on an island with a crowd of schoolboys, sole survivors of an air attack. “Nobody knows we’re here. Your dad don’t know, nobody don’t know,” he tells Ralph, the handsome leader-type whom he shrewdly latches on to. As the boys turn malevolent in the endless, unsupervised playtime, Piggy keeps a grip on reality that is far beyond his 12 years. His tragedy is that understanding can’t save him. </p> <p><strong>10. An anonymous student in Shyness and Dignity by Dag Solstad</strong><br /></p> <p>In recognition of all those pupils who changed the direction of my carefully planned lessons, I nominate as my final fictional schoolchild the faceless adolescent whose “aggressive, suppressed groan” in Elias Rukla’s Norwegian literature class stops the clock at page 43 of The Wild Duck and precipitates the beginning of the end of Herr Rukla’s life. This involves an umbrella and takes up the rest of Solstad’s wild and beautifully constructed novel. </p> <p>• Janet Davey’s latest novel is Another Mother’s Children (Chatto and Windus).

get asked which books I liked as a child. It’s a question that makes you think about your youth and the books you liked, and how they revealed your innate character, even though you weren’t aware of it at the time, helping to fashion the you you are now. <br /></p> <p>I liked the offbeat, the outlandish and the unconventional, which was telling. I liked playful language and absurd humour – also telling – and I loved travel: from the age of seven, I spent most nights losing myself and planning my future in the pages of a children’s encyclopaedia of the world. And because I liked all these things, my greatest fictional inspiration is <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pippi-longstocking-6.html\">Pippi Longstocking</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8200bc8f21fd85ba46b269c8bcefd36260587cb4\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441797406695/2e3a1b24-0294-413d-8953-bc8fe0236979-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Emma Shevah\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Shevah: ‘Pippi has done what I longed to do’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I realise now that the child captivated by the atlas was hungry for freedom, adventure and independence, and Pippi, at nine years old, has it all. She’s financially sorted thanks to her bag of gold coins. She has a monkey that sits on her shoulder and a horse that lives in her porch. She’s free of humdrum routines like school and homework, and is completely self-sufficient. Thinking her mother looks down at her through a hole in heaven, Pippi waves and says, “Don’t worry. I can look after myself.” And she can.</p> <p>Notably, Pippi has done what I longed to do: she’s travelled the world and has a story to tell from each of the countries she’s visited. Not that you can believe any of them. Truth, like most things where she’s involved, is a little more adaptable than it is for the rest of us. After all, “how can you expect a little child whose mother is an angel and whose father is a Cannibal King and who has spent her life sailing the seas to tell the truth always?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a014eaab1f57b7d1b4c95dbe9cb8784bc60c9437\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441798102927/ba67c0bb-52c9-439a-a270-a5157d3729b9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Astrid Lindgren\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Astrid Lindgren, creator of Pippi Longstocking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To highlight Pippi’s nonconformity, Astrid Lindgren sets her in the world we know. Her friends, Tommy and Annika, are “very good and well-brought up and obedient”. They go to school, toe the line and respect authority figures. Pippi, on the other hand, is a little anarchist. </p> <p>What I didn’t realise then is that she’s also a feminist, an optimist and a free thinker. We could all do with being a little more like her. She doesn’t get angry or offended even when she’s insulted. She’s happy with who she is and what she looks like. It’s not awful but “really rather nice” that she doesn’t have parents because there’s “no one to tell her to go to bed just when she’s having the most fun and no one to make her take cod liver oils when she felt like eating peppermints”. She’s generous, champions the downtrodden and amuses her sick friends by doing acrobatics at their window, hugging them and even the wrapping paper when they give her a present. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jun/02/the-10-best-pippi-longstocking-quotes\">The 10 best Pippi Longstocking quotes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When she does go to school, it’s only so she too can experience the holidays, but she can’t meet up at eight because she “can’t start <em>that</em> early”. She leaves home at ten on her horse, gallops wildly into schoolyard, ties him up and crashes into the classroom where – in typical good humour – she challenges the teacher, then draws on the floor because it’s a picture of a horse and it won’t fit on her piece of paper. </p> <p>And that’s Pippi. She can’t be confined to a small space – not on paper and not in life because her worldview is bigger than that. Nothing fazes her - not being on her own, not ghosts, and not authority figures trying to make her something she isn’t. She’s strong, yes: she can carry her horse and throw sharks around, but her strength lies deeper than that. She has an unshakeable sense of well being, her own take on the world and an enthusiasm for life that’s infectious. </p> <p>So when Tommy says, “You really can’t be certain about anything when it comes to Pippi!” he nails what I loved best about her. In a world of expectations, rules and responsibilities, Pippi - with wit and charm - embodies freedom, originality and the unexpected. As a child, I aspired to be just like her. And, to tell you the truth, I still do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7765e2ccc329bc0f33f1dcc5bd14c1f34e4db96c\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/9/1441796651325/aca96f21-c028-4e56-ac50-f2322c9deab8-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Dara\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Emma Shevah’s first novel, Dream on, Amber was published by Chicken House in March 2014.

href=\"http://rebeccaskloot.com/\">Rebecca Skloot</a> has hit back at a Tennessee parent who is trying to have her acclaimed biography of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/07/henrietta-lacks-hela-cells-research\">Henrietta Lacks</a> removed from local schools, saying the complainant is confusing “gynaecology with pornography”.</p> <p>Knoxville <a href=\"http://www.wbir.com/story/news/local/2015/09/07/local-mom-objects--controversial-book--summer-reading-list/71843596/\">news station WBIR reported that</a> Jackie Sims, the mother of a 15-year-old boy at Knox County Schools’ L&amp;N Stem Academy, had objected to Skloot’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/life-henrietta-lacks-rebecca-skloot\">The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</a> when he brought it home as part of his summer reading. Her son has now been assigned a different text, but Sims is attempting to get Skloot’s biography of the African-American whose cancer cells – taken from her without her knowledge and which subsequently changed modern medicine – pulled from all Knox County schools.</p> <p>“I consider the book pornographic,” Sims told WBIR, citing a passage in which Skloot imagines Lacks discovering a lump in her cervix: “With the door closed to her children, husband, and cousins, Henrietta slid a finger inside herself and rubbed it across her cervix until she found what she somehow knew she’d find: a hard lump, deep inside, as though someone had lodged a marble just to the left of the opening to her womb”. Sims also objected to a passage about Lacks’ husband’s infidelity.</p> <p>“It could be told in a different way,” Sims said. “There’s so many ways to say things without being that graphic in nature, and that’s the problem I have with this book ... I was shocked that there was so much graphic information in the book.”</p> <p>Skloot, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rebeccaskloot/posts/10153206597394016\">writing on Facebook</a>, said that “Just in time for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/texas-school-bans-books-in-banned-books-week\">Banned Books Week</a>,” a US-wide celebration of the right to read which takes place at the end of the month, “a parent in Tennessee has confused gynaecology with pornography and is trying to get my book banned from the Knoxville high school system”.</p> <p>Skloot pointed to the “many other local parents” who disagree with Sims, and to the “other schools throughout the US” who support her biography, saying: “I choose to focus on those stories, and I hope the students of Knoxville will be able to continue to learn about Henrietta and the important lessons her story can teach them. Because my book is many things: It’s a story of race and medicine, bioethics, science illiteracy, the importance of education and equality and science and so much more. But it is not anything resembling pornography.”</p> <p>Reviewing the book for the Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/life-henrietta-lacks-rebecca-skloot\">novelist Hilary Mantel wrote</a>: “Rebecca Skloot revivifies Henrietta, studying her not only as the originator of her cell line but as a woman embedded in history. Her absorbing book is not just about medicine and science but about colour, race, class, superstition and enlightenment, about the painful, transfixing romance of being American.”</p> <p>Skloot was later contacted on Facebook by Jimm Allen, assistant principal of the school attended by Sim’s son, who told her: “Know that the book and teachers have the complete support from the administration of the school. It’s an amazing book that fits with our Stem curriculum better than almost any book could. The next book that the sophomores are reading? Fahrenheit 451... Oh, sweet, sweet, irony.”</p> <p>Ray Bradbury’s dystopian novel about a world in which books are burned has been the subject of repeated attempts to ban it since it was published in 1953. “I keep joking with my friends that this is a big *You Know You’ve Made it When* moment for me and the book,” wrote Skloot on Facebook. “I’m in great company on the list of books people have tried to ban.”</p>","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"false","trailText":"Author says parent from Tennessee is confusing ‘gynaecology with pornography’ over description of Lacks discovering a lump in

to star as the hardboiled Oslo detective Harry Hole in Hollywood’s long-gestating adaptation of the Jo Nesbø crime novel The Snowman, <a

film, based on the seventh of Nesbø’s bestselling books, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/30/tomas-alfredson-scorsese-director-nesbo-snowman\">in April last year</a>. Martin Scorsese, who was expected to take charge of the cameras <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/22/martin-scorsese-direct-thriller-snowman\">when the project was first announced four years ago</a>, will now take an executive producer’s role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/30/tomas-alfredson-scorsese-director-nesbo-snowman\">Tomas Alfredson to replace Scorsese as director of Jo Nesbø's Snowman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Snowman sees Nesbø’s maverick cop investigating what appears to be Norway’s first serial killer, a murderer who always leaves a snowman near the scene of his crime. The author came to prominence in Britain with the publication in 2006 of his Harry Hole novel The Redbreast. The Snowman joins a further nine books about the maverick cop that have cemented Nesbø’s reputation as one of the more prominent of the current wave of Scandinavian writers.<br /></p> <p>The Snowman is being set up at UK production company Working Title and studio Universal. Hollywood has had mixed success with adapting Scandi crime novels so far: Sony’s English-language, David Fincher-directed and Daniel Craig-led remake of Sweden’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, based on the hugely popular Stieg Larsson novel, scored a decent $232.6m worldwide in 2011 on the back of strong reviews, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/29/is-the-hollywood-remake-dead\">nevertheless failed to spark an expected sequel</a>.</p> <p>Swedish director Alfredson is also known for the icy 2008 horror Let the Right One In. His adaptation of John le Carré’s cold-war spy novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy saw star Gary Oldman pick up an Oscar nomination for his role as taciturn British intelligence agent George Smiley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/29/is-the-hollywood-remake-dead\">Is the Hollywood remake dead?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fassbender is expected to be part of the awards season conversation for his turn in the Danny Boyle-directed biopic Steve Jobs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/06/steve-jobs-movie-review-michael-fassbender-telluride\">currently at the Telluride film festival</a>, where it screened at the weekend.

A purr of self-satisfaction rises from every page of this sugary little novel from bestselling French author Grégoire Delacourt. It’s a quirkily supercilious meditation on Hollywood celebrity. It’s a tiringly unconvincing love story. But most of all it’s a freedom of speech issue. Because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/27/novel-scarlett-johannson-wanted-banned-english-the-first-thing-you-see-gregoire-delacourt\" title=\"\">Hollywood film star Scarlett Johansson has tried and failed to get a legal ban</a> on its English translation.</p> <p>The story, translated by Anthea Bell, concerns Arthur, a handsome yet modest young car mechanic with no girlfriend and an awful tragedy in his family background. One morning he opens his front door and the first thing he sees is – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/scarlettjohansson\" title=\"\">Scarlett Johansson</a>! Her luscious husky-voiced sexiness is unmistakable, though she seems tired and troubled, with a weird tale to tell about just having come from the Dinard film festival.</p> <p>She wants to hang out with Arthur, apparently charmed by a glimpse she had of him being nice to a sweet little girl. Dazzled though he is by this glorious situation, Arthur senses something is amiss, because – and here is the whole ostensible point of the novel and the reason why Johansson’s legal action largely failed – it turns out to not be Johansson at all. She is a young woman called Jeanine Foucamprez who has been imprisoned by fate in a face and body that looks exactly like Johansson’s. If this sounds enviable, it isn’t. Though desirable, Foucamprez is desired by men who can’t get over her Scarlett-ness; she has no desire to be a professional look-alike and no identity of her own. The only identity available to her is that of Johansson, and that is already taken. As their relationship develops (he looks a bit like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling\" title=\"\">Ryan Gosling</a>, incidentally), Foucamprez hopes that real love will free her from this 21st-century identity crisis.</p> <p>The author all too clearly had his eye on a juicy movie deal for this high-concept romp – he even has a romcom-type “montage” of happy memories just before the end – and I suspect he hoped that Johansson would be a good sport and play Foucamprez herself. A film version is, after all, effectively impossible without her. Presumably the actor suspected this as well, and it contributed to her intense irritation at the way the author was presuming to make free with her identity, reputation and prestige as some kind of jokey avatar.</p> <p>Movie stars from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/charliechaplin\" title=\"\">Chaplin</a> to Dietrich have been dragooned into literary cameos before. And this would have been a neat idea for an ironic short story, with its gruesome touches and final Ballardian flourish. But Delacourt wants us to sign up for a romantic novel, and he will keep trying to have his cake and eat it by making lots of pop-culture movie references, sprinkling a little postmodern stardust on his prose while inviting readers to smile knowingly at the absurdity of Hollywood celebrity culture and establishing his literary bona fides with incessant highbrow references to the poet <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/jean-follain\" title=\"\">Jean Follain</a>.</p> <p>Weirdly, despite the blizzard of filmic namechecks, Delacourt doesn’t mention the specific films that must have influenced him: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/notting-hill\" title=\"\"><em>Notting Hill</em></a>, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/juliaroberts\" title=\"\">Julia Roberts</a>’s movie star falls for humble bookshop owner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/hugh-grant\" title=\"\">Hugh Grant</a> (incidentally, there’s a gag in <em>Ocean’s Twelve</em> about Roberts’s character passing herself off as Julia Roberts) and Jonathan Glazer’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/15/scarlett-johansson-under-skin-extraterrestrial\" title=\"\"><em>Under The Skin</em></a>, with Johansson playing an alien in Glasgow, in which the star filmed sequences with unwitting members of the public.</p> <p>By accident or design, Delacourt invokes interesting ideas, such as the loneliness involved in having beauty or celebrity, as well as the torment of those without them. “You don’t understand the misfortune of ugly women who know themselves to be beautiful,” says Foucamprez. But genuinely beautiful women and men have a refined misfortune of their own. They experience the same kind of power accorded to the well-known; people find themselves liking them without quite knowing why, and their views are listened to with unmerited respect. (A male celebrity once told me that his growing fame made him feel like a woman who was getting increasingly younger and more beautiful.) Yet the surfaces of celebrity and physical beauty are of limited interest: they are the first thing this novel wants to see – and the only thing. The book doesn’t offer us anything much, other than a brush with ersatz fame.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em>The First Thing You See</em><strong> </strong>for £10.39 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285464/?utm_source=editoriallink  &amp;utm_medium=\" merch&amp;utm_campaign=\"article&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

I was once caught up in a superpod of 200 dusky dolphins off the coast of New Zealand. The sleek cetacean torpedos were zipping all around, and at one moment I turned to face two dozen of them charging directly at me. I thought I was about to be run down. But these animals can detect an object the thinness of a human fingernail at 20 yards. Effortlessly, they turned and swooped between my legs and under my arms.</p> <p>Only later, as I climbed, exhausted, out of the water, was I told by the naturalist on board that in fact my playmates were continually having sex around me. Dolphins can mate three times in five minutes – not only with their own, but with other dolphin species. They’ll even mount sharks and turtles in their search to satisfy their endless libido. Surely only an animal with a lot of quality time on their flippers – being extremely efficient predators, highly social and intelligent – could have evolved such a lifestyle? And as such, shouldn’t they be the cynosure of our oceans, glorious role models for us, their land-bound cousins? Well, yes, and no.</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/324780/\"><em>Voices in the Ocean</em></a>, written by Susan Casey, editor of Oprah Winfrey’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/09/oprah-winfrey-neoliberal-capitalist-thinkers\">O Magazine</a>, seems to be pitching for a TV series with its show-stopping opening scene of the author swimming with spinner dolphins off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/hawaii\">Hawaii</a>. Entranced by these acrobats, which spin in the air like cotton bodkins, Casey feels she has stumbled on “some ancient tribe” whose language she did not understand but who seem to be communicating with her. Subsequently, she joins the wonderfully named Joan Ocean and her dolphin cult on interactive courses entitled “Dolphins, Teleportation and Time Travel”. But what starts out as a feelgood, new-agey account darkens like the sunlight diminishing in the deep, subtly turning into a devastating chronicle of one of the most egregious mismatches in natural-human history. The result is a brilliantly written and passionate book.</p> <p>The sorry tale of cetaceans in captivity begins with PT Barnum and his New York belugas, most of which died days after capture or, if they survived long enough, succumbed in fires in his Broadway emporia, boiled alive. The story resumes in Florida in the 1930s with the precursors of the modern-day oceanaria, but it wasn’t until the appearance of Flipper in his eponymous 1963 movie and later TV series that dolphin mania really took off. Even the New York Times was impressed: “The dolphin does amazing things. It registers pathos and joy in its own way, and manages to upstage anything less than 8ft long.”</p> <p>Part of the appeal was, and is, that perceived relationship between ourselves and these animals. The dolphin, so human-like in its physical scale and spirit, resembles a streamlined, happier version of ourselves, forever smiling. It’s why we like to believe in stories of dolphins “saving” people at sea. When surfer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsQeCO7jkFY\">Todd Endris</a> was bitten by a great white off Monterey, dolphins drove the shark away, formed a ring around Endris and escorted him back to the beach. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/dick-van-dyke\">Dick Van Dyke</a> told how falling asleep on his surfboard, and drifting out of sight of land, he was pushed back to safety by dolphins (presumably real rather than Disney cartoons). But Casey points out that there is an instinctive reason for these “rescues”. Dolphin social structure means that if they see a single human, they automatically think it needs to be returned to its pod.</p> <p>In a mind-expanding meeting with Lori Merino, a neuroscientist, Casey explores that sociality. Merino explains that the dolphin brain has a complexity exceeding our own brains, with an incredible processing ability that powers their lightning-quick responses. Dolphins not only recognise themselves in the mirror, indicating an abstract sense of self, but also on film, in the way that only humans and higher primates can. Uniquely, their brains also have an extra lobe which relates to emotion; some scientists believe dolphins may be more emotionally mature than humans, observing moral codes as a result of living so close together. Exhibiting communal individuality, they exist as if their peers’ bodies, and brains, were extensions of their own.</p> <p>It is the implications of the notion that “the dolphin in the tank is not a what but a who” that renders their captivity unbearable, for us as well as them. As she investigates marine parks, Casey realises that neither visitors nor staff are able to put the animals into context. “The entire industry is built on the illusion that dolphins had somehow dropped from the sky.” When Casey asks an employee, “Where did these dolphins come from?”, she receives no sensible reply. Either they don’t know, or they don’t want to. At Connyland, a Swiss dolphinarium – the exquisite irony of a landlocked state hosting such a facility is eloquent enough – the inmates are subjected to incessant noise and flashing lights in what one scientist calls “a perversion of the highest degree”.</p> <p>Other captive dolphins beat themselves up – gnawing on cement enclosures, banging their heads against walls, eating stray bits of plastic litter purely out of mind-numbing boredom. Many are regularly dosed with Valium.</p> <p>Yet more disturbing are Casey’s reports from Taiji, in Japan, and the Solomon Islands, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/japanese-aquariums-vote-to-stop-buying-taiji-dolphins-hunt\">the source of many of these captives</a>. In Japan, the culls continue apace: 20,000 animals a year are driven into narrow rocky inlets and slaughtered. The majority are destined to be eaten – despite the fact that their flesh contains so much mercury (up to 5,000 times the recommended safety limit) that human ingestion can result in memory loss, nerve tremors “and a hellish syndrome called desquamation, which is basically your skin peeling off”.</p> <p>Perhaps the butchered animals are the lucky ones. A dead dolphin is worth $500; a live one can be sold for $150,000, if it can be trained – 10% of the Taiji cull ends up in oceanaria in Asia, Russia and Ukraine, bought by dealers “untroubled by the process of plucking that dolphin out of a pool of blood that contains the dead bodies of its entire family”. That violence seems transferable. Joining the protesters in Taiji – both westerners and Japanese – Casey is confronted by demure kimono-clad women who shout in her face, “Why don’t you die instead of dolphins?” In the Solomon Islands, where questioning their dolphin slaughter can result in actual bodily harm, she gets into even deeper water.</p> <p>The cultural intransigence – and human greed – of this story defies logical reasoning. Perhaps that’s the point. We forever anthropomorphise, investing animals with our sins, imposing our stories on theirs. Some of us want to eat dolphins, some of us want to swim with them. What dolphins themselves might want is not part of the equation. Given our inability to live with our own kind, you might not hold out a lot of hope for the way we continue to treat other species.
