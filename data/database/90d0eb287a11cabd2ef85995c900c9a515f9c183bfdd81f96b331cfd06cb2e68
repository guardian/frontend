The other is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizline?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">40-year-old magazine publisher in New York</a>.</p> <p><strong>Right. I see the difference. It’s nice of Transport for London to name the new route after her. She’s pretty special, is she?</strong> I’m sure she is, but it’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/23/crossrail-named-elizabeth-line-honour-of-the-queen\">actually Queen Elizabeth they had in mind</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oh. How dreary. She already has the Jubilee Line. Before that it was the Victoria Line. I mean, I’m happy not to guillotine the royals, but do we have to be such creeps as well? </strong>“Given Her Majesty the Queen’s long association with UK transport, it is very fitting that this vital link across our capital will be named the Elizabeth Line in her honour,” says Patrick McLoughlin.</p> <p><strong>Who’s he?</strong> The sycophantic transport secretary.</p> <p><strong>He sure is. What does he mean the Queen has a “long association with UK transport”? She must use it less than almost any other living Briton!</strong> Unless you count her state-funded plane, those gold coaches, the royal yacht etc?</p> <p><strong>I flipping don’t. </strong>Anyway, it’s not all royals. There’s always the Northern, Central, Metropolitan, District …</p> <p><strong>Oh sure. They’re lots of fun. Even if you like the queen, isn’t the Elizabeth Line just a really boring choice?</strong> Not for Elizabeth Line it isn’t. She freaked out when she saw she was trending on Twitter. “There were a few moments of ‘What did I do last night’ panic,” <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/new-york-businesswoman-elizabeth-line-wakes-to-find-out-shes-trending-on-twitter-thanks-to-new-a3187356.html\">she says</a>, “but now I’m just having fun with it.”</p> <p><strong>I bet. They should do what they did with the Bakerloo. That’s the only good one.</strong> You mean take the beginning of where the line starts and the end of where it finishes and make a new word out of them?</p> <p><strong>Yes, even if it makes people think of floury toilets. </strong>Let’s see, so the new line starts in Berkshire and ends in Essex … Let’s try something else.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“We need an inspiring name, maybe something that symbolises London, something that brings people together…”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: “</strong>Sod it. Who’s queen at the moment? We’ll name it after her.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11289818","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-25T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2462698","internalRevision":"39","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Crossrail is the latest line to be named for the Queen.

The Amazings are just two of the <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4696078.ece\">85,000 people who legally changed their names by deed poll last year</a>.</p> <p><strong>They’re being silly, then. </strong>Not as silly as the man who changed his name to Bacon Double Cheeseburger.</p> <p><strong>Why did he do that? </strong>“Bacon Double Cheeseburger was the first name I came up with,” he said.</p> <p><strong>What could he possibly have been called for before, that he felt Bacon Double Cheeseburger constituted an improvement?</strong> He was called Simon.</p> <p><strong>Fair play to him. What other monikers have people have chosen?</strong> Bruce Wayne, Penelope Pitstop, Cristiano Ronaldo, Sarge Metalfatigue and Happy Birthday, to name but a few.</p> <p><strong>It sounds to me as if this procedure isn’t expensive enough. </strong>Actually, <a href=\"https://deedpolloffice.com/change-name/enrolling\">it doesn’t cost anything. You can even make your own form</a>. But if you want your deed poll enrolled with the courts, it costs £36.</p> <p><strong>What if I decide I don’t like my new name? </strong>You can change it as many times as you like, for any reason besides fraud.</p> <p><strong>Are there no rules at all? </strong>Names such as Jesus and Satan are forbidden, because they’re blasphemous. And first names can’t be anything that is also a rank or title, such as Sir, Lord, Duke, Professor or Doctor.</p> <p><strong>That’s all my best ideas gone. I might change my name to “password123”, so I only have one thing to remember. </strong>Sorry, no numbers or symbols are allowed. And surnames are limited to 50 characters.</p> <p><strong>What are some non-stupid reasons for changing your name? </strong>You might want a new identity to go with your new gender, or so you can hide from an abusive partner. Last year, a student changed his name by deed poll <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/05/student-changes-name-by-deed-poll-to-avoid-220-ryanair-admin-fee\">because it was cheaper than getting Ryanair to alter the name on his ticket</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Next door’s bins are in our front garden again. Bloody Amazings.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “We don’t serve Bacon Double Cheeseburgers here. This is Starbucks.

drama in The Archers as editor leaves for Walford","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-21T17:30:33Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> The Archers</p> <p><strong>Age</strong>: 65.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> none – it’s a radio programme, about rural life in the village of Ambridge.</p> <p><strong>You mean that show after the news where they talk about milk yields?</strong> That’s the one. You’re an occasional listener, then.</p> <p><strong>I don’t listen, I just hear. It goes in one ear and out the other. </strong>In that case, you’ll probably have missed the latest news.</p> <p><strong>Oh God, what’s happened now? Has Ruth lost a wellie or something?</strong> No, there has been a departure.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t they just kill off a bunch of people in a flood? </strong>That was last year. And, anyway, it’s not that kind of departure. Sean O’Connor is leaving.</p> <p><strong>Who is Sean O’Connor? Is he the one that sells eggs?</strong> He’s the editor.</p> <p><strong>The editor of what? Borsetshire Life?</strong> He’s the editor of the show.</p> <p><strong>Wait, are we talking about an actual person? </strong>Yes. After two and a half years with The Archers, O’Connor is moving to EastEnders.</p> <p><strong>He should find Albert Square quite a bracing change, after working on a soap where people pull lambs out of sheep all day.</strong> O’Connor has already worked on EastEnders. Indeed, he has been criticised for bringing some of the TV soap’s breathless sensationalism to Ambridge.</p> <p><strong>I wouldn’t go that far.</strong> Perhaps you’re forgetting about all those dramatic storylines: the sudden deaths, the fights, the affairs, the bypass …</p> <p><strong>Not to mention the abuse Helen Titchener, née Archer, is currently suffering at the hands of that scumbag, Rob. </strong>Are you sure you’re not a loyal listener?</p> <p><strong>Don’t be ridiculous. Sometimes, when I visit my mum on Sundays </strong>… It’s nothing to be ashamed of – 4.8 million people regularly tune in.</p> <p><strong>So who is O’Connor’s replacement going to be?</strong> It’s not yet known, but whoever they choose will have to strike a difficult balance between maintaining ratings and satisfying the traditionalist fanbase.</p> <p><strong>Perhaps the new editor could organise a huge cake sale in a barn, and then burn the barn down? </strong>Your idea will be passed on to the relevant department.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “This job would be perfect for anyone with experience in radio drama, a deep knowledge of the show’s history and a real drive to innovate.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Except you, Helen darling. You need to rest.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11275051","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-22T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2460145","internalRevision":"71","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Sean O’Connor is leaving Ambridge and heading east after a semi-controversial stint that brought death and chaos to rural Britain.

Is this about that thing she said?</strong> It is. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/15/emma-thompson-uk-would-be-mad-not-to-stay-in-eu\">She was in Berlin promoting her new film and said she would vote to stay in the EU</a>, calling Britain “a tiny little cloud-bolted, rainy corner of sort-of Europe, a cake-filled, misery-laden, grey old island”.</p> <p><strong>What a splendid turn of phrase she has. How neatly that captures the British spirit of tender self-deprecation.</strong> Yeah, about that. The Sun has responded by superimposing a slice of Victoria sponge on a picture of her face and put it <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs/the_papers\">on the cover with the headline: “Shut yer cakehole!”</a></p> <p><strong>They don’t like tender self-deprecation?</strong> That’s not really their thing, no. They also call her a “pro-EU super-luvvie”.</p> <p><strong>Sounds fair.</strong> Many of the MPs were rather meaner. “Ms Thompson is typical of the worst sort of fat-cat luvvie,” Burns said. “Most Brits love Britain and will see the referendum as a celebration of democracy our ancestors died to defend. Sadly, they also died to allow snooty ladies like Ms Thompson to vent their metropolitan elitist snobbery.”</p> <p><strong>Wait a minute. Is she against democracy, too?</strong> No, that’s just some word-twisting on Burns’s part. I think he’s confusing her with Isis, Hitler, etc.</p> <p><strong>Easily done. So, basically, he’s saying she’s entitled to her opinion?</strong> Yes, kind of. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goddersbloom/status/699607378291982336\">Bloom volunteered to “spank her silly bottom”</a>.</p> <p><strong>I bet he did. Unfortunately, no ancestors died for that.</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanHannanMEP/status/699529803448377344?lang=en-gb\">Hannan brings up a technical issue with her</a>. “In what sense is Britain a ‘tiny little island’, Emma Thompson?” he asked. “Geography? Economics? Diplomatic reach?”</p> <p><strong>Well?</strong> It’s geography. He was right the first time. Within Europe, the island of Great Britain is smaller than France, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Finland, Poland, Italy and Romania.</p> <p><strong>Still, you shouldn’t admit that in front of a bunch of Germans, should you?</strong> No. That’s our little secret.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I’m pretty sure our ancestors died so that Europeans would stop fighting each other.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And to defend the British empire, which was – ahem! – far from democratic.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 18 February 2016. An earlier version referred to Godfrey Bloom as an MEP, rather than a former MEP.<br

<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The very elixir of eternal life.</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong> <strong>Book clubs make you live for ever? </strong>Well, no. But they might make you live a little longer.</p> <p><strong>Because in my friend’s book club, everybody drinks enough wine to fell an elephant.</strong> It’s only true if you’re part of a certain demographic.</p> <p><strong>Explain yourself.</strong> <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/2/e010164.full?sid=8cb77b19-ec32-4851-ae68-b533dc25294a\">According to results published this week in BMJ Open</a>, a UK medical journal, people enjoy healthier lives if they maintain social bonds after they retire. Something like a book club, where you regularly meet friends and chat, can significantly reduce your risk of death in the first six years post-retirement.</p> <p><strong>So it’s the social interaction that keeps you alive, not the book club itself? </strong>That’s right. You could also be a member of a sporting club or a church society.</p> <p><strong>So I wouldn’t actually have to read the books?</strong> I suppose not. Like you said, it’s the social interaction that counts.</p> <p><strong>So I could just memorise the book’s Wikipedia summary on the way there and I’d still live longer?</strong> Listen, I’m not really sure you’re fully grasping the point …</p> <p><strong>I hate books.</strong> You’re weird.</p> <p><strong>How else can I live longer?</strong> Well, the study is all about the negative effects of social isolation in the elderly, and how it can increase the risk of dementia or cognitive decline. And one thing that can stop social isolation is …</p> <p><strong>Don’t say it.</strong> Formal employment.</p> <p><strong>Goddamn it. </strong>Sorry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/02/the-rise-of-the-alternative-book-club\">The rise of the alternative book club</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>So that’s my choice, then? Work for ever or read boring books?</strong> No, that isn’t your choice at all. If you’ve just retired, you should try to remain as active as you possibly can. Maintaining strong social relationships with likeminded people is important for your health, but you can achieve this in a number of ways. It doesn’t have to be a book club.</p> <p><strong>What about if I started an I Hate Books club? </strong>I suppose that could also work, if you found enough people to join.</p> <p><strong>I definitely would. Books are idiots.</strong> Maybe you should just go and have a lie down.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “In today’s book club, we’re discussing A Short Guide to a Long Life by David B Agus.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And don’t forget that next week’s book is Swimming in a Sea of Death by David Rieff.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11263982","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2457995","internalRevision":"42","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Being a member of a reading group may extend your life, according to a new study.

age?</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> What do you mean? It looks like people complaining. I wish I could say I expected better, but honestly, this is just the kind of lazy journalism that’s typical of the Guardian nowadays.</p> <p><strong>Sorry, I am trying my best. I just thought you might want to know that the famously stoical people of Britain (including you, it would seem)</strong> <strong>are complaining about things more than they used to. </strong>Oh, really?</p> <p><strong>Yes. According to data just released by Ombudsman Services, there were 52m complaints made about products and services in Britain </strong><a href=\"https://www.ombudsman-services.org/2015-complaints-top-50-million.html\" title=\"\"><strong>last year</strong></a><strong>, which is 21% fewer than the 66m that were made </strong><a href=\"https://www.ombudsman-services.org/more-brits-taking-action-against-poor-service.html\" title=\"\"><strong>in 2014</strong></a><strong>.</strong> What do you mean fewer? I thought you said people were complaining more?</p> <p><strong>I did say that. But maybe they just had fewer things to complain about?</strong> Did they?</p> <p><strong>Yes. According to the data, the number of “conceived complaints” – ie the average number of times during the year that someone might have complained – has also fallen, from 2.9 to 2.4.</strong> These people must live charmed lives if they didn’t even get three things to complain about all year.</p> <p><strong>Nevertheless, when we compare this to the number of times people actually complained, we get a complaining rate of 46% for 2015, which is similar to the 48% from 2014. But both of those show British people being much more complainy than they were </strong><a href=\"2013 https://www.ombudsman-services.org/downloads/CAM_Research_Report.pdf\" title=\"\"><strong>in 2013</strong></a><strong>, when the rate was just 32%.</strong> Riii-ght. What were they complaining about?</p> <p><strong>Things they bought from shops last year, in 23% of cases, followed by the service they got from telecoms (16%) and energy companies (13%), then various others. Interestingly, there are often big differences in where people did the most complaining. </strong>Oh yes?</p> <p><strong>In both 2013 and 2014, Londoners on average made more complaints per person than people in any other British region.</strong> Typical. They think the world revolves around them, those Londoners.</p> <p><strong>But in 2015 a new region came storming into the lead: Yorkshire and Humberside. </strong>By ’eck! Now I’m even less surprised.</p> <p><strong>But these figures show only the number of complaints, not the rate at which people were complaining, or how justified the complaints were, or … </strong>Don’t spoil it.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “In my day we didn’t complain about things. We just got on with it.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “But you’re complaining when you say that!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11261570","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2457536","internalRevision":"61","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The last two years have seen a big jump in how much the average Briton complains – with 2015’s whinges being led by those from God’s own country and the capital","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Yorkshire and London are the UK's moaniest places","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2016-02-15T15:38:26Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4e4fa605c8674c049d6200bc29e97855a75bb3e/0_76_2045_1228/140.jpg","liveBloggingNow":"false","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4e4fa605c8674c049d6200bc29e97855a75bb3e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f4e4fa605c8674c049d6200bc29e97855a75bb3e/0_76_2045_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What are you complaining about?

your face.</p> <p><strong>Eurgh!</strong> Yeah, that’s right! “BBC3 is a badge of quality and shorthand for content that will stimulate emotions and provoke reactions!” says controller Damian Kavanagh.</p> <p><strong>I thought it was the at-times-good, at-times-awkward marriage of BBC Television and yoof kulcha?</strong> It can be two things. And now it can be anything, because an exciting new dawn beckons online!</p> <p><strong>What kind of new dawn? I thought their budget had been cut from £85m to £25m?</strong> Well yes, but to quote from the BBC again: “On Tuesday 16 February, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58_cUHX6Fgc\" title=\"\">BBC3 will switch from a linear broadcast channel to an online first destination</a>.”</p> <p><strong>From a what to a what now?</strong> From a TV channel to a website.</p> <p><strong>Isn’t it already a website? Most of its shows are on iPlayer.</strong> Yes, I suppose. Although the website will now feature a Tumblr-ish page called The Daily Drop and another section called The Best Of, which will host original programmes.</p> <p><strong>So they’re changing the website. </strong>Yes. And they’ve “announced a range of comedy, drama and documentary commissions and formats featuring new talent, new writers and new directors”.</p> <p><strong>Which all channels do all the time.</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>So the actual new dawn in this case is being taken off TV?</strong> Yes. Although Kavanagh doesn’t see it as a question of being “taken off”. It’s more about being “freed from the constraints of”. For instance, they can now mix up blogs and websites and videos as they please. “Because we’re freed from the schedule, we can use whatever format and platform is most appropriate,” he says.</p> <p><strong>Except TV. </strong>Yes, except TV obviously. Although all BBC3 originals will later be repeated on BBC1 or BBC2.</p> <p><strong>So it’s going to be a website where some of BBC1 and BBC2’s lesser programmes get uploaded early?</strong> I suppose you could look at it that way if you’re determined to be negative. But we’re entering a new era for media, in case you hadn’t noticed. <a href=\"www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34932688\" title=\"\">Getting the right balance is tricky for the BBC</a>, like it

<p><strong>Age:</strong> 66.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Concerned.</p> <p><strong>Who he?</strong> A medical professor. Principal of the Cancer Vaccine Institute. Specialist in cancer immunology and HIV/Aids research.</p> <p><strong>Good for him! Is he in the news with a treatment breakthrough? Is there something to uplift us all for once rather than send us yet further into the deepening slough of despond?</strong> Umm …</p> <p><strong>Go on. </strong>He says the NHS is on its knees and “could collapse completely” because of immigrants from the EU that we are legally obliged to treat.</p> <p><strong>Did he perhaps say this while drunk at a private dinner party? </strong>No, it’s part of a speech he will deliver at a conference entitled “The Good Life After Brexit”.</p> <p><strong>Oh. This depresses me. </strong>He is a member of Ukip.</p> <p><strong>This depresses me more. </strong>He stood as its general election candidate last year in Sutton and Cheam.</p> <p><strong>But I expect doctors to be liberal! By which I mean intelligent! By which I mean liberal! </strong>We expect much. And sometimes we are disappointed.</p> <p><strong>Is he right, though? When a cancer expert says things, I sort of think maybe they are right? </strong>They are often right if they are saying things about cancer. About the cost of immigrants to Britain’s health services, not so much.</p> <p><strong>How so? </strong>Well, there’s the 2013 research that showed traffic – and money – flows many ways.</p> <p><strong>For example? </strong>Eighteen British hospitals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/24/medical-tourism-generates-millions-nhs-health\" title=\"\">made £42m from people coming here for treatment on 2010</a>. Health tourists in total spent about £219m on shopping, eating, transport and accommodation while they were here. And while an estimated 52,000 came here for treatment, about 63,000 Brits went abroad. To say nothing, of course, of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/26/nhs-foreign-nationals-immigration-health-service\" title=\"\">11% of NHS staff and 26% of doctors who are non-British</a>.</p> <p><strong>So the picture is more complicated than the not-quite-member of Sutton and Cheam suggests? </strong>Just a bit, yes. It would take a global initiative to accurately measure international patient mobility.</p> <p><strong>Until then, we just count the cost of incomers – unless they’re staff we’ve siphoned out of other, poorer countries – and ignore the rest? </strong>It turns out you shouldn’t always do what your doctor tells you.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> Physician, listen to thyself.</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> Empirical research is for diseases, not thoughts!</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11241929","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-10T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2453077","internalRevision":"89","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Professor Angus Dalgleish is one of the country’s leading cancer specialists – and his diagnosis for the NHS is terminal<br />","allowUgc":"false","lang":"en","headline":"Is this doctor (and Ukip candidate) right that EU migrants will destroy the NHS?","byline":"Pass notes","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2016-02-09T11:40:40Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/140.jpg","liveBloggingNow":"false","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cancer expert, europhobe, and Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam 2015, Angus Dalgleish\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Non-empirical … Angus Dalgleish, renowned cancer expert, committed europhobe and unsuccessful Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam, 2015. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ggqj","wordcount":"380","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56b9c9f8e4b07a94592e8b1a","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-14T11:13:00Z","standfirst":"Professor Angus Dalgleish is one of the country’s leading cancer specialists – and his diagnosis for the NHS is terminal","creationDate":"2016-02-09T11:14:00Z","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-02-09T22:00:52Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"502453077"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2016/feb/09/ukip-cancer-europe-angus-dalgleish-brexit","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/politics/shortcuts/2016/feb/09/ukip-cancer-europe-angus-dalgleish-brexit","sectionName":"Politics","elements":[{"id":"30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760/324_478_3611_2165/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© 2015 Bloomberg Finance LP.","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/30ec92423f64c90eeaab349865b4a2f8d5ee1760","suppliersReference":"UK UKIP FARAGE","altText":"Cancer expert, europhobe, and Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam 2015, Angus Dalgleish","caption":"Non-empirical … Angus Dalgleish, renowned cancer expert, committed europhobe and unsuccessful Ukip candidate for Sutton and Cheam, 2015.
