I got this shirt for my 12th birthday maybe a week before the 1993-94 season started and at that time Wimbledon didn't have a shirt sponsor. It must have been in that week that the club announced a sponsorship deal with LBC Radio and therefore started the season with LBC's logo on the shirts. To this day, and including that whole season, I have never seen anyone wearing this shirt without the sponsor. It was purchased from New Malden Sports, one of the very few places that sold Wimbledon shirts. From memory, Ribero only made the shirt in two sizes, the smallest being \"regular\", so, 20 years on, it still fits. Get in! <em>dgb123</em>",

It had wooden floorboards: proper old-school. The shirt was made in the 1930s by Umbro. This shirt had been used for a time as a window display (hence the fading in certain places) and then sat for years in a drawer in the back of the shop. It is beautifully soft and very nicely made. It's really comfortable to wear and is my most treasured memento of my childhood supporting West Brom, with Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham, Bryan Robson etc. I was a season-ticket holder from 1977 until 1981, the last truly glorious time at the Hawthorns. Having this genuine 1930s shirt made me realise that so many of those \"heritage\" shirts, which became trendy in the 1980s, were really rather poor efforts - lacking the authenticity, detail and feel of the originals. <em>RoboScribe2000</em>",

This is the home shirt worn during the shock run to the 1992 FA Cup final (but not in the final itself; Liverpool won the toss so Sunderland wore their white, blue, and green away ensemble instead). I'm proud to say that it still fits (can John Byrne or Don Goodman say that I wonder?) and the 100% polyester material is in pretty good nick, although the hummel chevrons on the collar have curled a little thanks to over-washing. The much-loved and much-missed ship badge is in better condition than others on some of my later shirts, and the sponsor's rather simplistic logo (Vaux Breweries - pronounced 'Vorks', and not, as I've heard on occasion, 'Vo') is as bold today as it was 22 years ago. <em>HardcorePrawn</em>",

The kids' version of the shirt didn't have the Holsten logo on it, so I went for a rather oversized adult shirt, with, of course, Klinsmann on the back. He was our star signing and was a joy to watch. The game was postponed because the pitch was waterlogged, so I had to wait a bit longer to see him play. It was a blessing in disguise, however, because we waited at the players' entrance and got a few autographs: Gary Mabbutt, Sol Campbell, Teddy Sheringham. Jurgen Klinsmann sadly never appeared, but I was hooked. Eighteen years later, and making the trip up the Victoria Line to Seven Sisters is still every bit as exciting. COYS! <em>Tom Newman</em>",

Made by the South American brand Topper, the shirts were characterised by sunshine cotton-blend jerseys that got darker with sweat, forest green trim and paired azul-blue shorts with little stripes. The 1982 version perhaps remains the purist’s pick, but I’d always been a fan of the 1986 model. In 2009 I was finally able to buy it from an ebay seller located in Malaysia. Sounds shady, but I know a 100% genuine Topper jersey when I see one. The shirt came with Zico’s No10 on the back; since commercially sold kits were never personalised in those days I suspect it originated from the CBF kit room, and may have been prepared for the legend himself. Brazil ended their relationship with Topper in 1991. Despite winning two more World Cups in the ensuing years, they’ve never looked as good since. <em>jamesviola79</em>",
