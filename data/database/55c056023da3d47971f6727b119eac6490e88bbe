        "headline":"US shutdown drags into second day as Republicans eye fresh debt ceiling crisis",
        "body":"<p>The shutdown of the US federal government dragged into a second day on Wednesday amid concerns that the crisis will bleed into a hazardous confrontation with hardline Republicans in two weeks time over the country's borrowing requirement.</p><p>Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary, has said the US will start running out of cash unless the debt limit, set by Congress, is raised by 17 October. However in a repeat of the current standoff over the federal budget, the conservative wing of the Republican party is threatening to exploit its leverage over raising the debt ceiling to unpick Obama's healthcare reforms.</p><p>Economists warn that such a confrontation could have far more severe consequences than the current government shutdown, which has resulted in 800,000 federal employees being forced to stay at home without pay. A failure by the US to meet its debt payments could lead to a default and trigger a wider economic crisis that would be felt across the world. </p><p>The brinksmanship is being led by an influential group of radical Republicans in the House of Representatives, who are using every available technique to attack the Affordable Care Act. The law broadens access to healthcare, passed both houses of Congress three years ago and survived a presidential election. Barack Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House on Tuesday, accused the cadre of \"holding the economy to hostage\" over their ideological opposition to the law.</p><p>A key part of the legislation, known as Obamacare, came into force on Tuesday, coinciding with the start of the first shutdown in almost two decades.  The shutdown has closed national parks, museums and monuments, and reduced many government departments and agencies to a threadbare staff. The White House announced the cancellation of Obama's forthcoming visits to Malaysia and Philippines because staff had not had time to prepare for it.</p><p>The president is still scheduled to leave the US on Saturday, keeping to the first leg of what will now be a truncated tour, with summit meetings in Indonesia and Brunei. The shortened trip is a blow to the administration, which is seeking to build economic ties in Asia, and underscores the severity of the crisis in Washington.</p><p>But the decision to cancel the last two stops of the tour also ensures Obama will return to Washington in the run-up to a probable showdown over the debt ceiling.</p><p>Senior figures in both parties appear to be coalescing around the view that there is little point in resolving the stalemate over the budget without also dealing with the impending confrontation over the debt limit. \"This is now all together,\" said the second most senior Democratic senator, Dick Durbin.</p><p>Paul Ryan, the Republican house budget committee chairman, put it in more stark terms: \"We think the debt limit is the forcing mechanism. That's what we think will bring the two parties together.\" </p><p>The White House previously said it would refuse to negotiate over the debt ceiling, saying Republicans should not be allowed to use the threat of a global economic crisis to advance their narrow ideological agenda against healthcare.</p><p>On Wednesday, Republicans in the House were expected to revive a motion to ease the more politically embarrassing impacts of the shutdown, in the latest of a series of tit-for-tat exchanges on Capitol Hill designed to deflect blame for the crisis and manage the public relations fallout. </p><p>Republicans are claiming that their Democratic counterparts are responsible for the shutdown, highlighting their refusal to negotiate. But polls show that the public is largely holding the Republican party responsible for a closure of large portions of the government which, should it last long enough, will start to be felt far outside of Washington, as government bureaucracy slows to a halt.</p><p>Already the tax-collection agency, the Internal Revenue Service, has suspended audits and most staff at Nasa have been furloughed. Some major government websites and Twitter feeds have been inactive since Tuesday.</p><p>Using special procedural rules on Tuesday night, the GOP tried to fast-track a measure that would provide piecemeal relief from the shutdown, freeing up funding to pay for national parks, veterans services and the local government in Washington DC, which could run out of cash in two weeks, bringing the capital city to a standstill. </p><p>Republicans failed to get the two-thirds majority required under the rules, but indicated they would resume the efforts on Wednesday, using a more conventional route that would only require a straight majority. In return, Democrats in the House were reportedly considering their own procedural measures that would force a vote on a clean spending bill – stripped of initiatives to unpick Obamacare – and reveal the depth of the rift in one the Republican side.</p><p>Congressman Peter King, on the moderate wing of House Republicans, told MSNBC that increasing numbers of his colleagues were growing tired with a Tea Party contingent that were seeking to \"hijack the party\". </p><p>He said Republican lawmakers would meet on Wednesday to try to find a way through the impasse, and suggested as many as a hundred were now weary of the strong-arm tactics advocated by the leading Tea Party senator, Ted Cruz. However in recent days King has overstated the size of potential rebellions by Republican moderates and underestimated the strength of the stranglehold held over the party's House leadership by its hardline members.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418854972|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|1dc407dfad505dfe4a288919cb96fac4cbbe5afd -->",

        "headline":"US shutdown: a guide for non-Americans",
        "body":"<h2>Please explain what just happened</h2><p>The US government has begun shutting its non-essential services. Hundreds of thousands of workers are waking up to the news that they are on unpaid leave, and they don't know how long it will last. The shutdown, triggered at midnight Washington time, will bring a range of services to a standstill across the world's largest economy.</p><h2>Why?</h2><p>The Federal government had no choice. The US financial year ended on 30 September, and politicians on Capitol Hill have failed to agree a new budget for the 2013-2014 financial year. Even a 'stopgap' funding deal proved beyond them. Without a budget deal approved by both parts of Congress, the House of Representative and the Senate, there's no legal agreement to pay non-essential staff.</p><h2>Weren't they supposed to fix this last night?</h2><p>They tried. A series of proposals rattled between the two sides on Monday night until midnight struck without a deal.</p><h2>Why couldn't they agree a deal?</h2><p>Under the US constitution, the president cannot unilaterally bring in legislation. And despite weeks of talks, Republicans continue to include cuts and delays to Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act in the budget legislation they sent up to the Senate.</p><p>The House of Representatives is controlled by the Republican Party, whose Tea Party movement remain deeply opposed to Obamacare. They tried to use the budget as leverage to crowbar changes to the Act. The Senate, which is under the control of Obama's Democrats, has stood firm.</p><h2>Will the shutdown mean the entire US government grinds to a halt?</h2><p>No, it's not an anarchist's (or libertarian's?) dream. Essential services, such as social security and Medicare payments, will continue. <br />The US military service will keep operating, and Obama signed emergency legislation on Monday night to keep paying staff. But hundreds of thousands of workers at non-essential services, from Pentagon employees to rangers in national parks, will be told to take an unpaid holiday.</p><h2>So what happens how?</h2><p>US politicians are meeting again in Washington on Tuesday. Before Monday's session broke up, the lower house proposed a 'bipartisan committee' to consider a way forward. The Senate is expected to reject this proposal, sticking to its position that Obamacare cannot be unravelled. Federal staff will remain unpaid until a budget is agreed. A 'stopgap' funding plan is an option, but Obama appeared wary of that option, arguing that would simply guarantee a repeated fight in a few weeks' time.</p><h2>How much damage will it cause?</h2><p>If people aren't getting paid, they won't spend as much in the shops. They may be unable to meet essential financial commitments, such as mortgages and credit card payments.</p><p>Analysts at IHS Global Insight have calculated that it will knock $300m a day off US economic output (total US nominal GDP, or output, was around $16 trillion last year).</p><p>The key issue is how long it lasts. Moody's Analytics reckons that a two-week shutdown would cut 0.3% off US GDP, while a month-long outage would knock a whole 1.4% off growth.</p><h2>When did this last happen?</h2><p>It's the first shutdown since 1995-1996, when Bill Clinton and the House of Representatives (and its speaker, Newt Gingrich) also failed to agree on a budget to fund federal services. That row ran for 28 days (over two stages).<br />But it was a more regular event in the 1980s, usually for a few days at a time. In total, the US government has partially shut down on 17 occasions before today.</p><h2>Why doesn't it happen in other countries?</h2><p>The shutdown situation is a product of the US democratic system. The president is both head of state and head of the federal government, without a guaranteed majority in either of the legislative bodies where new laws are debated and voted upon (because presidents, congressmen and women and senators are elected separately). The president can't simply ram laws through Capitol Hill.</p><p>In Britain, for example, tax and spending policies are outlined in the budget, presented to parliament by the chancellor of the exchequer. These changes are brought into law in a finance bill in the House of Commons. That's in effect a confidence vote in the government, and even the most fractious backbench MP would balk at rebelling on it.</p><p>Finance bills are also one area where the elected House of Commons has the upper hand over the unelected House of Lords. The Lords have no power to reject a money bill; they can only delay it for a month.</p><h2>How does the US shutdown row tie in with the debt ceiling battle?</h2><p>They are separate issues, but the shutdown is raising fears over the debt ceiling.</p><p>America has a legal limit on its borrowing of $16.7tn dollars, and it's likely to hit that point in mid-October.</p><p>If a deal isn't reached, then America would run out of borrowing room, meaning the world's biggest economy would default on its debts. Both problems need solving – and a shutdown is now eating into valuable time to fix the debt ceiling.</p><h2>Why can't they just raise the debt ceiling?</h2><p>Again, legislation is needed. Republicans are again trying to link the plan to Obamacare – arguing that the healthcare reforms are unaffordable.</p><h2>How are the markets reacting?</h2><p>So far, there's no panic. Investors are calculating that the shutdown will be short. But prepare for nervousness as that debt ceiling deadline gets closer.<br />The dollar, though, is being hit – dropping half a cent against major currencies.</p><p><em>This article originally confused the two chambers of Congress.

        "body":"<p>In September 2007 Gerrit Six <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-09-18-belgium-ebay_n.htm\" title=\"\">put Belgium on eBay</a>. It was day 100 of his country's attempt to form a government and an exasperated Six suggested selling it for parts. He offered free delivery but made it clear the country was secondhand and anyone who bought it would be saddled with $300bn in national debt. EBay eventually took the ad down, but not before the bidding reached €10m. A government wasn't formed for another three months. A few years later Belgium went 589 days without a government.</p><p>At the time the German paper, Die Tageszeitung, described Belgium, home to the headquarters of Nato and the EU with a per capita income of $38,100, as the \"most successful 'failed state' of all time\". Now the US is giving it a run for its money.</p><p>Not in terms of longevity – at the time of writing the American federal government has been closed for almost a week – but in terms of dysfunctionality. Belgium's stalemate was shaped by the challenges of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/14/belgian-elections-language-explosive-issue\" title=\"\">linguistic divide</a> that reflects an economic imbalance. In other words, it was about something.</p><p>The US government shutdown has been prompted by the party that recently lost an election trying to overturn a law it doesn't like. Having failed to stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/us-politics-congress\" title=\"\">healthcare reform</a> in the legislature, the supreme court and during the presidential election, House Republicans are now refusing to pass a budget until the reforms are delayed. This is their compromise position. They originally wanted it scrapped. It's less a shutdown than a shakedown.</p><p>Predictably, Obama is adamant that the Grand Old Party should not extort him out of his most prized legislation. Moreover, negotiating under these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent in which the nation can be held hostage to overturn laws that have been democratically settled.</p><p>Even most of those who oppose healthcare reform do not believe shutting down the government is a winning strategy.  <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/health.htm\" title=\"\">Polls show a huge majority of Americans disapprove of the shutdown</a> and far more blame the Republicans than the Democrats,  even though neither party comes out looking particularly accomplished. In practical terms the protest is largely futile. A key provision of the healthcare reforms kicked in the day before the shutdown and will continue whether the federal government is working or not. So Republican plan A is to close down the government until reforms are delayed, even though their demands have been rejected and the reforms are under way. There is no plan B, beyond belligerence.</p><p><a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750\" title=\"\">\"We're not going to be disrespected,\"</a> insisted Republican Congressman Marlin Stutzman last week. \"We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is.\"</p><p>If this continues for another few days, the damage will be limited. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/09/politics/government-shutdown-impact/\" title=\"\">So far, the shutdown barely affects most peoples' daily lives</a>. National parks and monuments are closed, some government websites are down and some regulatory bodies aren't working. But by 17 October Congress must agree to raise the debt ceiling so that the US can pay its bills. Republicans have used this as a bargaining chip before. If this standoff over the budget were to bleed into talks about the debt ceiling then the US <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/how-debt-ceiling-could-do-more-harm-than-the-impasse-in-congress.html\" title=\"\">risks defaulting, with ramifications for the global economy</a>. At that point you wouldn't be able to give the country away on eBay.</p><p>There are three main reasons the country has reached this position. First, the US is more polarised politically than in recent memory. There are <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/17/partisan-polarization-in-congress-and-among-public-is-greater-than-ever/\" title=\"\">fewer self-described moderates</a> and far more conservatives and liberals among Republicans and Democrats respectively than there were in 2000 – the year the nation was evenly split between George Bush and Al Gore. The divide is not just ideological but geographical. In his book, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/18/books/review/Stossel-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">The Big Sort</a>, Bill Bishop explains that in 1976 roughly a quarter of Americans lived in counties where the presidential victor won by 20 points or more; by 2008, that figure was up to a half.</p><p>Second, if that weren't enough, the electoral constituencies have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/18/politics/gerrymandering/index.html\" title=\"\">so shamelessly gerrymandered</a> that consequences for acting in an extreme manner are rare. Electoral boundaries, in most areas, are drawn not by independent commissions but local politicians. Their aim is not to create congressional districts but safe seats for their party. Consequently, precious few congressmen or women fear losing an election so long as they keep their base happy. During the government shutdown of 1995-96 a third of all Republican members came from districts won by Democratic president Bill Clinton; today only 7% come from districts won by Obama. This means that for most of them to keep their jobs they must appeal not to the mainstream but to the margins.</p><p>Finally, as a result, the roots of this shutdown lie far more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/23/john-boehner-tea-party-stooge\" title=\"\">in an internal dispute within the Republican party</a> than they do in a battle between Democrats and Republicans. On one side are the dwindling number of moderate Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/04/magazine/04graham-t.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimespolitics&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">those in the party establishment who see the Tea Party as an electoral liability</a> and fear the party has been overtaken by extremists who mistake acting out for strategy and opposing everything Obama does for opposition. On the other side are the Tea Party hardliners who believe the GOP establishment has compromised too often and given away too much. Branding negotiation a weakness in itself, they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-obamacare-circus\" title=\"\">not in Congress to make legislation but to make a noise</a>.</p><p></p><p>Since Republicans took over the House in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\" title=\"\">the latter have been running the show</a>, forcing the country from one self-imposed crisis to another with gay abandon, shameless guile and clueless zeal.</p><p>For while the economic fallout from this particular shutdown may be limited so far, the damage to America's credibility is huge and enduring. Belgium doesn't claim to be the leader of the free world, insist on its exceptionalism or have its currency (now the euro) as the world's reserve. The day before the shutdown, as the Italian government teetered towards apparent collapse <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/world/europe/intraparty-divisions-imperil-berlusconis-long-hold-on-power.html\" title=\"\">the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Italian politics has a turbulent, baroque flair even when little is at stake\". To the rest of the world American politics looks pretty similar. Only there's a great deal at stake.</p><p>It's not obvious how these trends can be effectively checked. It is, however, clear that until they are the American political class will look less like the  elders of the shining city on the hill they claim to be and rather more like kids in a kindergarten playground waiting for an adult to intervene.</p><p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a><em> </em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419191190|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|cf17973c5c43080395173abbb2cf8311072b75b6 -->",

        "headline":"If America is the world's greatest power, why the infantile politics?",
        "body":"<p>A perfectly normal looking couple come to sit opposite you on the train. They seem pleasant enough and you fall into conversation, but you soon note that the man is not making a lot of sense and foam is showing at the corners of his mouth. At every turn, he contradicts his partner or, more weirdly, himself, and you realise that inside he is seething with violent and paranoid fears. You conclude that this character is going to do serious harm to himself, and may hurt other passengers in the process, so you leave and find a seat in another carriage.</p><p>That's our experience of living with the American right – the Tea Party activists who  have brought the world's largest economy to the brink of catastrophe to make one last stand against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The world is powerless to persuade or intervene and we are at the mercy of what seems truly irrational behaviour.</p><p>This is certainly some kind of high point in the Tea Party's mission to disrupt, but it cannot simply be written off as delinquency. The movement presents the symptoms of a prolonged infantile spasm, at the same time as a coherent belief that central government and especially Obamacare are inimical to the liberty of the individual and the freedom of individual states to determine their future.</p><p>Liberals will describe this as a failure of consensus politics that has been driven by the lowest suspicion and prejudice available in American society, manipulated by big business, pandered to by lax or demagogic media companies, such as Fox News, and ridden by ambitious politicians who promise a fantasy land that they cannot deliver.</p><p>That's mostly my view, yet I have to concede that it ignores the deep suspicion of centralised power in America that goes back to the founding fathers and is an essential part of national culture. The checks and balances designed by the authors of the constitution seem archaic in a world that demands swift executive action, but we shouldn't forget that even though Obamacare has been democratically scrutinised and passed by Congress, the restraints are being applied by the Tea Party or TPers – in the name of liberty.</p><p>There is still a minority – 18-20 – of Republicans in the Senate who oppose the government shutdown and recoil from a default, which would mean the government would stop paying its bills when it reaches its debt limit on or after 17 October, and so cause a greater international crisis than anything we have seen in the last five years. It's obviously suicidal, but, for the moment, Tea Party representatives, such as Ted Cruz, the junior Republican senator for Texas who made a 21-hour filibustering speech attacking everything about the White House except Mrs Obama's vegetable garden, are calling the shots.</p><p>But the strategy, if that is the word, is bound to fail, because President Obama cannot resile on the key reform of his administration and, at some point, the Tea Party has to swerve or risk the anger of the majority of the American people and so jeopardise the Republican party's chances at the next presidential election.</p><p>The movement has placed itself in a position where it cannot win and that is going to be very damaging to its Republican host, which has already been greatly distorted by the invasive Tper micro-organism. As the <em>Economist</em> points out, Republican members of Congress have become more fearful of being challenged by their own extremists than losing at a general election. \"Many pander to extremists on their own side rather than forging sensible alliances with the other,\" says the<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21587211-land-free-starting-look-ungovernable-enough-enough-no-way-run-country\" title=\"\"> magazine's leader</a>.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, writing about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/21/american-gun-out-control-porter\" title=\"\">gun control in the US</a>, I applied the ironic technique of treating America with the same condescension that America speaks about other nations. But those tropes would be pointless for the Tea Party, for there are few movements anywhere in the world that are so unrealistic or have such a startling lack of rigour. Satire and irony are useless when it comes to a movement that is pro-life on abortion but pro-death in the matter of executing people or the 32,000 yearly toll caused by privately owned firearms. Tea Party Republicans pepper their speeches with the words \"freedom\" and \"liberty\", but do nothing to oppose the government surveillance programmes that infringe the rights of all Americans. They rail against the power of big government, but never the malignancy of big business.</p><p>They are all over the map. Their policies are like the diet of high fructose corn syrup that Tpers often favour – appetising, temporarily satisfying but ultimately a health hazard.</p><p></p><p></p><p>We have our own political boobies, in Ukip and the Conservative party, (Jacob Rees-Mogg applauded the US government shutdown) but we are rarely exposed to the dazzling fanaticism of a man such as Cruz. He was elected last November but has already become a national figure and is being touted as a possible presidential candidate in 2016. Princeton and Harvard educated, with a Cuban father, he looks quite a bit like a young version of Senator Joe McCarthy. And indeed, shortly after arriving in Washington, his prosecutorial line of questioning of Chuck Hagel, Obama's nominee for defence secretary, with its references to possible ties to foreign enemies, reminded people of McCarthy. \"Are you or have you ever been…\"</p><p>I recommend his filmed interviews, especially with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EangNYS0K0\" title=\"\">Evan Smith of the <em>Texas Tribune</em></a>, because you will not see a more polished zealot. This is a man who agreed that social security was a Ponzi scheme on the grounds that it paid investors from their own money or the money invested by others. He regards many of his colleagues as \"squishy Republicans\" and repeats this refrain: \"The federal government is engaged on a war on jobs and what is at stake is individual liberty and the constitution\", which makes absolutely no sense, given the hundreds of thousands of government employees now on unpaid leave because of the shutdown.</p><p>If you found yourself on a train with Cruz, you would be struck by his intelligence and confident manner, and initially you might buy his line that the constitution needs to be redrafted to beef up the 9th and 10th amendments, which he says would enhance individual liberties and the states' powers. But very soon you'd see none of it adds up and that his suspicion of government is far greater than his love of liberty.</p><p>The constitution may need to be rewritten, but only to give the executive the power to govern the modern American state and bring order to the country's finances. For in all this no one mentions the elephantine figure in the room – America's debt, last estimated to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24365018\" title=\"\">$16,699tn</a>.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419131197|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|0eea769bb0ef92abe04d990f04e8d54b7d89e5cb -->",

        "headline":"After this budget chaos is Uncle Sam ready for assisted suicide?",
        "body":"<p>I am of the pro-American generation. To us America was the future. Europe was nowhere. We read, saw, heard, visited America. We studied and worked there. Some of us even married Americans. We were affiliates of the tribe. We bought into the exceptionalist legend.</p><p>America can sorely test that loyalty. We were taught that the federal constitution must take the rough with&nbsp;the smooth. It was the forge on which American diversity was beaten into unity. It was how a continent which&nbsp;might have fragmented into a myriad states – black, white, Hispanic, oriental, whatever – has remained one. That wise American historian, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Arthur Schlesinger</a>, used to say that its constitution waltzes democracy to the cliff-edge of disaster, peers into the&nbsp;abyss, but always pulls back.</p><p>This week it has danced to that edge. It beggars belief that somewhere which tediously calls itself the \"most powerful nation on Earth\" cannot beat a few AK-47s and has now failed the <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whelk_stall\" title=\"\">whelk stall test</a>. (This may come as no surprise to anyone who visited Baghdad 10 years ago.) America's executive is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/01/us-government-shutdown-takes-effect-workers\" title=\"\">hamstrung by its legislature</a>. Its ruling class cannot pay its bills. Uncle Sam, always portrayed as a benign paternalist, looks ripe for the workhouse or assisted suicide.</p><p>Nor is that all. Pro-Americans argue that the role of global policeman is better exercised by a free democracy than by a communist ideologue or authoritarian imperialist. But who is America policing? Europe, Russia, China and India can look after themselves. Al-Qaida, America's current enemy of choice, is nasty but a menace chiefly to Muslim countries. It poses no existential threat to the west, and remains a nuisance to it only because western interventionists encourage it to be so.</p><p>Nor is this policeman any longer the freedom-loving \"bobby on the beat\". The moral morass into which the United States was led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/osamabinladen\" title=\"\">Osama bin Laden</a> remains intractable. George Bush demanded the power to decide for&nbsp;himself whom to arrest, jail, fight and kill by merely declaring \"war on terror\". Barack Obama meets his generals each week to determine which distant \"bad guys\" are to be assassinated without trial, largely to appease the makers of drone technology.</p><p>America's 21st-century army lost contact with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions\" title=\"\">Geneva conventions</a> and degenerated into prisoner abuse and torture. Its internet industries collude with secret agencies to intrude on private citizens, guilty or innocent. Moral superiority has been debased by the paranoia of \"they who are not with us are against us\", and \"the law-abiding have nothing to fear\". America refuses to defer to supranationalism, to the United Nations or international courts.</p><p>Back home, US democracy seems to be malfunctioning, lurching towards corporatist oligarchy. Presidential elections are fought only in a dozen \"swing states\". The late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/feb/14/ronald-dworkin\" title=\"\">Ronald Dworkin</a> warned that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission\" title=\"\">the supreme court's \"Citizens United\" case</a>, which refused to&nbsp;curb campaign spending, would enable big money to \"buy out\" democracy. Meanwhile the House of Representatives, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/us-government-shutdown-house-delay-obamacare\" title=\"\">author of this week's chaos</a>, hardly honours its name, more gerrymandered, bribed and corrupted than any chamber in the free world.</p><p>The catalogue of woe seems endless, and America's friends find too much truth in the portrayal not to be alarmed by it. But it is time to return to Schlesinger's constitutional optimism. The famous system of \"checks and balances\" is messy but clearly robust. As long as the patient feels pain there is life in the body, and whatever else may seem wrong there is no doubting the existence of check and balance.</p><p>Visitors to the US can be easily shocked by its political polarisation. Just as many Americans are questioning their \"role in the world\", so many worry over the aggression of their domestic debate. The old badinage of Democrat and Republican has become a tribal scream, a running battle of well-heeled hatred. The <a href=\"http://voteview.com/polarized_america.htm\" title=\"\">McCarty-Poole-Rosenthal</a> measure of party polarisation – the \"flight to the extremes\" described in their book, Polarized America – has the two parties more divided ideologically than since the Great Depression.</p><p>So we pull back for a moment for some sense of proportion. Social psychologist <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Jonathan Haidt</a> has studied the question, \"Why do good people disagree?\", and concluded (in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/07/righteous-mind-jonathan-haidt-review\" title=\"\">The Righteous Mind</a>) we overrate the rational in politics. Education, tribe, belief, family, security, are what matter most in determining our political outlook. This applies even among those of similar backgrounds.</p><p>We do strongly disagree, and thank goodness. Democracies are inevitably polarised. There is a copious literature on the need of the media to separate argument, to squeeze the moderate middle ground. There is nothing peculiar to the US in this. The quickest way to be ejected from a BBC studio is to remark that there is a case to be made on both sides.</p><p>I doubt if any of this is new, any more than there is novelty in great powers behaving badly, or in large bureaucracies growing corrupt. Political parties are the stuff of democracy. Gladstone and Disraeli hated each other. Britain's criminal justice system makes a cult of bipolarisation. A row in a TV studio is preferable to the chicanery, riots and broken heads of <a href=\"http://www.adnax.com/views/viewsoflondoncharacters02.htm\" title=\"\">Hogarth's London</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall\" title=\"\">Tammany Hall's New York</a>.</p><p></p><p>The best way to make democracy work is to keep the argument simple and transparent. Better have its antagonists shouting at each other than nodding and winking. To the outside world there may be something frightening in seeing the US constitution at work, with two bruisers knocking hell out of each other. But that constitution remains a wonder of the modern world. Its imperfection channels the tensions and rivalries of a huge country into one collective, an enterprise achieved nowhere else on Earth.</p><p>The US constitution is umbrella to a multitude of policies as well as opinions. What is fascinating is its capacity for disagreement and self-correction. It <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23891202\" title=\"\">lets Colorado legalise pot</a>, Florida run brutal prisons, Massachusetts put two-thirds of its youth through college, and Texas pursue \"judicial killing\". Its securocrats may go wild, but they are brought to book far more ruthlessly than in Britain. America's government may be leaden and its soldiers crass, but its scientists are the world's most brilliant, its innovators the most daring and its artists, certainly its film-makers, the most talented. What we have seen this week is a democracy imperfect but alive.</p><p>America is not broken. It is merely having one of its periodic nervous breakdowns, probably not before time. As it tiptoes to the edge of the cliff, its friends may look on in horror. But it will&nbsp;tiptoe back, for sure.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418771961|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|ac22e3dea9d0bc067eb605e0a8f2b6d9fe0090a5 -->",

        "headline":"The US healthcare paradox: we like the Affordable Care Act but fear Obamacare",
        "body":"<p>President Obama's healthcare law is hated and loved by some so much that they are willing to shut down the government over it. I'm not sure I've ever seen so much passion over an issue about which so few (myself included) know as much as we should. </p><p>I wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/obamacare-healthcare-reform-americans-want\">about this divide</a> when Obamacare was in front of the US supreme court. Americans were opposed to \"Obamacare\", or the Affordable Care Act, yet they were in favor of many of its provisions. Not surprisingly, Americans lacked knowledge of what exactly the law did. </p><p>So, as the political fight has intensified, on the eve of implementation of one of the ACA's key provisions, the creation of new health insurance pools, how much has changed? Does the noisy debate on the ACA mean Americans are better-informed than before about Obamacare? Here are five ways Americans' opinions about Obamacare have and have not evolved over the past year.</p><p><strong>1. Americans have grown more negative in their views</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/us-health-bill#!showpoints=no&amp;estimate=custom\">HuffPollster chart</a> tells the story fairly well. It includes polls that ask about Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). </p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418679265'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/30/1380571737011/Obamacaregraph_460.jpg' alt='Obamacare approval' width='460' height='308' class='gu-image'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Last June, the split was about 47% opposed to, and 40% in favor of, Obamacare. That gap narrowed, after the supreme court upheld the law's constitutionality. The difference between those for and against the law dropped to only 2pt by the election. </p><p>Since the election, however, US public opinion has changed drastically: 52% of Americans now oppose Obamacare – that's tied at the record high. A little less than 38% are in favor of it, according to the HuffPollster aggregate.</p><p><strong>2. The Obamacare v the Affordable Care Act difference still exists, though may be overblown</strong></p><p>A few weeks ago, a <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/101064954\">CNBC poll</a> purported to show major differences when asked about the law in different manners: 46% were against Obamacare, while only 37% were opposed to the ACA. Importantly, support for the healthcare law also dropped from 29% to 22%. What's happening is that Americans have heard a lot about \"Obamacare\", but not much about the ACA. The key is the difference between those who favor and those who oppose for each question, which is about 15pt.</p><p>Most of the polls that show the best numbers for Obamacare (that is, the margin of opposition at 10pt or less) don't mention Obama's name. These include the <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-september-2013/\">Kaiser</a> and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html\">ABC/Washington Post</a> surveys. A <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2013/09/17/fox-news-poll-68-percent-concerned-about-their-health-care-under-new-law/\">Fox News</a> poll found the gap was slightly wider, with the margin between favorable and unfavorable towards Obamacare at 26pt, and just 16pt for the ACA. Some, such as the <a href=\"http://poll.uconn.edu/2013/09/25/as-obamacare-enrollment-begins-most-americans-have-unfavorable-view-of-healthcare-law/\">UConn/Hartford Courant</a> poll, use similar wording and find the largest gaps. </p><p>The bottom line is that many Americans oppose Obamacare no matter the wording. But Obama's name probably makes them even less likely to like it.</p><p><strong>3. There is a percentage of Americans who oppose the law for <em>not going far enough</em>, though this, too, is likely overblown</strong></p><p>Democrats like to point out that even as a majority opposes Obamacare, a certain percentage of Americans think it's because the law is \"not liberal enough\". A new <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/27/poll-obamacare-vs-affordable-care-act/\">CNN poll</a> puts that percentage at 11%. When you add those who favor Obamacare to those who regard it as \"not liberal enough\", you have a near-majority. </p><p>The problem with this finding is that I don't believe that Americans necessarily know what \"too liberal\" means in this context. My evidence for that is that the group with the highest percentage of those who say they are against the law because it is \"too liberal\" are, in fact, Republicans.</p><p>The actual percentage who don't like Obamacare because it's not liberal enough is probably closer to 7%, if not lower. That's the percentage Kaiser found when they asked if Obamacare went \"far enough\" in <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-september-2013/\">changing the healthcare system</a>. I caution, however, that some of that may be those who want radical <em>conservative</em> change – such as yearning for government to get completely out of healthcare. </p><p><strong>4. Americans continue to like the individual provisions, except for the individual mandate</strong></p><p>While only 37% of Americans viewed the ACA favorably in a <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/march-2013-tracking-poll/\">March 2013 Kaiser poll</a>, most liked what the healthcare bill is scheduled to do. Over 55%, and up to 88%, of Americans regard the following facets of Obamacare at least somewhat favorably: tax credits to small businesses to buy insurance, closing the Medicare \"doughnut hole\", creating insurance exchanges, giving rebates to customers of insurance customers that spend too much on administrative costs, and the employer mandate. Even Republicans like all of them except the Medicaid expansion, increase in Medicare tax, employer mandate, and individual mandate. </p><p>Indeed, the only requirement of Obamacare most people didn't like was the mandate for all people to join it. </p><p><strong>5. Americans still don't seem to know what Obamacare means for them</strong></p><p>Given the discordance between Americans' feelings on the individual parts of Obamacare and the law as a whole, it's not that surprising that a striking 41% of Americans don't feel they have enough information about the ACA, per the UConn/Hartford survey. Only 19% say they are very familiar with the law. </p><p>The individual provision questions strike the same chord. More than a third of people are unaware of the health insurance exchanges, subsidy assistance to individuals, or the Medicaid expansion. The latter two provisions of the law have actually seen a decrease in the percentage of people who knew these policies were in the bill, since it first passed. The only part of Obamacare that Americans seem to know really well is the individual mandate, which has also seen the largest percentage-point increase in awareness.</p><p>More worryingly, more people than not thought that Obamacare includes a public option, undocumented immigrant insurance, \"death panels\", and cuts to Medicare. The Affordable Care Act contains none of these. </p><p>The fact is most of Obamacare is liked by the public. The issue is that the provision that is not liked is the best-known.</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Americans are confused on Obamacare</strong></p><p>There are lots of confused and confusing data here, and it's difficult to say anything definitive about how Americans feel about the healthcare law signed by President Obama in 2010. As I found more than a year ago, they don't like the law overall, even while they approve many of its measures. </p><p>Some Democrats may say that this points in their favor, but the same dynamic of a differential between the backing people will give for a broad proposition as opposed to their support for individual policies could be said to operate in the case of gun control. Thus <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/09/11/what_colorados_recall_results_mean_for_dems_119913.html\">two Colorado state senators were recently recalled</a> over a gun control law whose individual provisions many said they liked.</p><p>Overall, Americans clearly don't know enough about Obamacare. Of course, they know just as little about the Affordable Care Act – but to the extent that they are less hostile to a law that doesn't bear President Obama's name, it does appear that the embrace of the term \"Obamacare\" by Democrats and the White House was a tactic that has not worked out.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418671558|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|aad425aa2d3fab82f9c1ce14aeb70f7c38d5828c -->",

The euro has risen to $1.357, the highest level since early February.</p><p>However, international stock markets were largely unmoved by the crisis – French and German shares, for example, were up around 0.5% – with most investors expecting the shutdown to be short-lived, and the impact largely confined to the US.</p><p>Some analysts said investors may also be reasoning that the crisis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/sep/19/federal-reserve-tapering-decision-confused-the-markets\" title=\"\">could delay the so-called \"tapering\" of the Federal Reserve's recession-busting policy of quantitative easing</a>, which helps inflate share prices by pumping cheap money into financial markets.</p><p>Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at Daily FX, said: \"The somewhat counter-intuitive response seems to reflect investors' continued pre-occupation with the direction of US monetary policy. Filtered through this prism, the shutdown and its negative implications for US growth are seen as delaying a move to 'taper' QE asset purchases, which seems to be driving a swell in risk appetite.\"</p><h2>So does that mean it's just a little local difficulty for the Americans?</h2><p>Yes and no. The direct economic hit may be relatively small: analysts at the ratings agency Moody's suggest a week-long outage could cut a relatively manageable 0.3% off GDP. But a serious knock to confidence could rattle consumers and investors at a crucial time.</p><p>The US recovery remains fragile, as the Fed stressed last month when it decided to continue buying $85bn (£52bn)-a-month worth of bonds, instead of \"tapering\" QE.</p><p>A major wobble, throwing the spotlight back on to the health of the US public finances, is the last thing the nascent upturn needs; and it could also exacerbate markets' anxiety in the run-up to the potentially fraught debate over raising the government's budget ceiling in mid-October.</p><h2>How will the UK be affected?</h2><p>If the shutdown is short-lived, probably very little; if it is prolonged, then the uptick in sterling could continue, and a stronger pound is the last thing George Osborne wants as he tries to rebalance the economy towards exports, so that Britain can \"pay its way in the world\".</p><p>There is also a risk that as investors turn their minds to the dangers of debt-burdened developed economies struggling to generate a sustainable upturn, they start to scrutinise the policies of other such states – including the UK.</p><p>George Osborne's grim pledge in his Conservative party conference speech that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/30/george-osborne-spending-plan-pain\" title=\"\">austerity will continue until 2020</a> may partly have been aimed at reminding international markets that the UK system is different to America's, and he has no intention of being diverted from his deficit-cutting course.</p><h2>What about the rest of the world?</h2><p>Any prolonged shutdown would rapidly start to hit US consumer spending, as hundreds of thousands of public sector workers are furloughed; and that will crimp America's demand for imports from the rest of the world.</p><p>At the margins, weaker investor confidence, and the dollar depreciation that has so far been the main financial impact of the shutdown, could also slow the flood of capital into the US that was one of the key trends in international markets over the summer.</p><p>The switch from riskier markets to the perceived safety of America drove up exchange rates and bond yields in many emerging economies, forcing central banks in several countries, including India and Brazil, to take emergency action.</p><p>A renewed sense of crisis in the US is likely to stem that flow, particularly after the Fed had already raised questions about the health of the US economy when it declined to \"taper\" QE in September.</p><h2>What will China think?</h2><p>Beijing's attitude is the key to one of the more subtle potential implications of this latest budgetary wrangle.</p><p>China holds a mountain of US assets, mostly Treasury bonds, effectively IOUs from Washington – the by-product of running huge trade surpluses over the past decade and a deliberate policy to keep the Chinese currency, the yuan, cheap.</p><p>However, Chinese politicians have repeatedly expressed concern over recent years about the growing risks of this large exposure to the US, as Washington has appeared increasingly unable to bring tax-and-spending policy under control. When the US was stripped of its AAA credit rating by Standard &amp; Poors in August 2011, after a previous partisan wrangle over raising the government's debt ceiling – not a problem suffered in autocratic single-party states – China reacted with fury. Xinhua, the official news agency, said: \"The days when the debt-ridden Uncle Sam could leisurely squander unlimited overseas borrowing appear to be numbered. To cure its addiction to debts, the US has to re-establish the common sense principle that one should live within its means.\"</p><p>Since then China has deliberately moved towards making the yuan more convertible on international markets, which would allow it to appreciate, and reduce the need to pile up potentially risky US debts – a policy that in the long term could remove the biggest buyer of US debt from the markets, potentially making it far more costly for America to borrow.</p><p>Simon Derrick, of BNY Mellon, suggested the lack of outraged comment over the current budget impasse may suggest \"the Chinese government has already made its mind up about what it needs to do and sees little point in complaining any further\".</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418725540|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|c026304182b32ad1a6a75217b44113ef57ad317f -->",

        "headline":"US shutdown: gunslinging and standoffs straight out of Hollywood",
        "body":"<p>The great US government shutdown of 2013 began, said the Iowa senator Tom Harkin, \"like a scene from the Hollywood western High Noon\". There was the Democrat sheriff Barack Obama, squared off against a gang of southern gunslingers, both sides determined not to give an inch and prepared to blow each other's brains out to get what they came for.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of Washington acted as if it had seen this movie before. The metaphorical tumbleweed blowing down the corridors of Capitol Hill reflected not a fear of being caught in the crossfire, but a cynical war-weariness that left many lawmakers on the sidelines until it was too late. After three years of similar standoffs over the federal budget that were resolved at the last minute, no one could quite believe that this one would finish with shots fired.</p><p>For several days leading up to Monday night's deadline for passing new federal spending authorisation, the familiar clash between Republican and Democrat leaders was characterised not by dramatic tension but over-rehearsed exchanges of rhetoric. The House speaker, John Boehner, would insist that  he had \"no interest in shutting down the government\", then launch another salvo of impossible demands at the Democrats that risked doing just that. No matter how many times the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said he would not negotiate in the face of such threats, Republicans would try again to attach riders to the spending authorisation aimed at repealing the vexed healthcare legislation known as Obamacare.</p><p>So convinced were both sides that the other was bluffing that the White House is said not to have made serious preparations to deal with a possible shutdown until the last 48 hours. A bizarre all-night speech by Senator Ted Cruz last Thursday might have looked like an old-fashioned filibuster designed to force the agenda, but was actually just for show once the Senate timetable had long since been set in train. Wall Street barely noticed what was going on until Monday morning, when the Dow Jones index fell sharply and the penny dropped that Congress might not cut a deal this time.</p><p>With hindsight, the fact that both sides had come to the brink so many times before was part of the problem, not a reason for complacency. The  <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/dec/28/fiscal-cliff-obama-talks-budget\" title=\"\">\"fiscal cliff\" crisis in December 2012</a> resulted in a messy compromise that weakened Boehner's position within his own party and emboldened hardliners. Likewise, the anger among Democrats that started when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/09/government-shutdown-obama-boehner-deal\" title=\"\">Obama averted a shutdown in 2011 </a>by cutting government spending only fuelled a sense of injustice in his own party. The name-calling that followed – Reid claimed on Monday that House Republicans had \"lost their minds\" – will make peace and reconciliation that much harder.</p><p>Despite the slow buildup, these mounting emotions resulted in a final nine hours that could well have been scripted by Hollywood. The many reporters camped out in the warren of Capitol Hill corridors began to realise that they were in for a long night when the door to a private meeting of House Republicans opened briefly on Monday afternoon to let one of them go to the bathroom. Out slipped a roar of applause, as the majority party loudly cheered plans to make a fresh series of demands over Obamacare that they must have known Democrats would reject.</p><p>So bitter had the fight become that Senator David Vitter successfully pushed an amendment targeting lawmakers' own staff members – depriving them of standard employee health insurance subsidies worth thousands of dollars just to prove a political point. Amid stacks of pizza boxes and rumours of heavy drinking, both chambers settled in for a night of votes that were no longer designed to avert a shutdown, but to decide which side would get the blame for causing it.</p><p>Shuttling along the third floor corridor that links the two public galleries, it was almost possible to sense the political momentum being passed back and forth between House and Senate as each side tried not to end up holding the bill when midnight struck. House votes took longer to set up, allowing an hour or two of angry denunciations on the floor. At one point the minority whip Steny Hoyer shouted after a departing Boehner to accuse him of bringing \"shame on the House\". Then the spending resolution would be pinged back to the upper house where Democrat grandees such as Chuck Schumer were more withering with their scorn. \"I sort of feel sorry for [Boehner],\" he said before helping swiftly to  kill off two House proposals in quick succession with brutal majority votes lasting less than half an hour each.</p><p>And just when a shutdown looked most inevitable, a glimmer of hope would emerge. The Republican security hawk Peter King emerged as an unlikely moderate champion in the House when he threatened to vote with Democrats to kill off the Vitter amendment. Allies claimed he had 25 rebels with him that would block both a procedural motion and Boehner's last big legislative push. In the end the Republican whip Kevin McCarthy prevailed, urging his caucus to stand united. King persuaded only five colleagues to vote with him – and four of them were actually conservatives demanding that the leadership toughen up the language.</p><p>A similar false dawn occurred just before midnight when Republicans announced that they would pause hostilities to discuss formal peace talks, or a \"conference\" in the jargon. Perhaps Boehner would allow a simple vote on the funding resolution after all, mused hopeful onlookers. But up popped a laconic Republican aide in the press gallery to reassure reporters that this was no climbdown; simply another step in the long-drawn process of apportioning in blame. \"I have both breakfast and lunch packed in a bag already,\" she warned reporters hoping for an early exit. By the time Reid called a halt and announced that the Senate would refuse to \"play games\" by taking part in these conference talks, the White House already had its statement ready to go informing government officials to prepare for shutdown.</p><p>There were lighter moments, most noticeably during Cruz's 23-hour pseudo-filibuster which fell an hour short of the all-time Senate record set by the anti-civil rights senator Strom Thurmond in the 1950s. At one point Cruz filled the time by reading a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/dr-seuss\" title=\"\">Dr Seuss</a> book to his young children watching at home. Rand Paul, who held a shorter filibuster against drone strikes last year, revealed that he had persuaded Cruz to swap his cowboy boots for tennis shoes to cope with the need to stand up for so long. Senate staff members openly speculated as to whether Cruz had opted for a catheter or adult diaper to cope with the other physical consequences of such marathon speaking feats.</p><p>But acknowledging the human frailties of Congress may be scant consolation for the millions of Americans now facing the consequences of their headlong rush towards shutdown. Though essential government services will continue for now, 800,000 other public employees will be told to stay at home, many without pay, causing untold disruption to everything from national parks to the Nasa's space programme. The long-simmering resentment and bitterness that drove politicians to the brink will make it mighty hard to find a way back.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418718031|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|a6b090a01ad21a0120dd2b98dad31d479716e426 -->",

        "headline":"US debt-ceiling debate reflects a troubling constitutional power struggle",
        "body":"<p>Perhaps investors are becoming inured to the United States' annual debt-ceiling debacle, now playing out for the third year in a row. But, as the short-term antics become more routine, the risks of long-term dysfunction become more apparent – a point underscored by the shutdown of the federal government.</p><p></p><p>President Barack Obama is right to complain of blackmail. The US Congress cannot expect to use the threat of default – that is, a weapon of mass financial destruction – as a normal means of extracting concessions. Unfortunately, because Obama himself has established a history of making concessions in the face of congressional brinkmanship, the debt-ceiling debate has morphed into more than just a short-term political fight.</p><p></p><p>Increasingly, the battle over the US government's debt ceiling reflects a deeper constitutional power struggle between the president and Congress. This struggle, if left unresolved, could profoundly weaken the government's ability to make significant economic decisions in the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a breakdown in political civility would hardly make the US unique; all too many countries suffer some degree of political dysfunction. It would take some doing to match (or exceed) Italy's record of governmental paralysis. But if Congress continues to hijack US economic policy, it bodes ill for the economy's otherwise bright long-term prospects.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, the rest of the world has seemingly unbounded confidence – reflected in very low borrowing rates – in America's capacity to put its house (of representatives) in order. No one can imagine that a country with so many unique economic advantages would risk such a damaging self-inflicted wound as default would cause.</p><p></p><p>But this time could be different. Obama needs to force his Republican opponents to blink, and there is no guarantee that they will. In the past, it was Obama who blinked, knowing that even if a catastrophic debt default was largely caused by congressional Republicans, he would be likely to absorb some of the blame in the next election. Now that re-election is behind him, Obama could be inclined to take more risks, with an eye towards securing his economic legacy.</p><p></p><p>What will that legacy be? Despite the federal government's destructive impulses, the US economy is showing great resilience and looks set to become stronger. Of course, Obama would love to see this trend continue, as would almost everyone else. Unfortunately, a US debt default, even a technical one, would have unforeseeable consequences that could threaten the recovery.</p><p></p><p>Consider what happened when the Federal Reserve misplayed its hand with premature talk of \"tapering\" its long-term asset purchases. After months of market volatility, combined with a reassessment of the politics and the economic fundamentals, the Fed backed down. But serious damage was done, especially in emerging economies. If the mere suggestion of monetary tightening roils international markets to such an extent, what would a US debt default do to the global economy?</p><p></p><p>Much of the press coverage has focused on various short-term dislocations from counterproductive sequestration measures, but the real risk is more profound. Yes, the dollar would remain the world's main reserve currency even after a gratuitous bout of default; there is simply no good alternative yet – certainly not today's euro. But even if the US keeps its reserve-currency franchise, its value could be deeply compromised.</p><p></p><p>The privilege of issuing the global reserve currency confers enormous advantages on the US, lowering not just the interest rates that the US government pays, but reducing all interest rates that Americans pay. Most calculations show that the advantage to the US is in excess of $100bn per year.</p><p></p><p>There was a time, during the 1800s, when the United Kingdom enjoyed this \"exorbitant privilege\" (as Valéry Giscard d'Estaing once famously called it when he served as the French president Charles de Gaulle's finance minister). But, as foreign capital markets developed, much of the UK's advantage faded, and it had almost disappeared entirely by the start of the first world war.</p><p></p><p>The same, of course, will ultimately happen to the dollar, especially as Asian capital markets grow and deepen. Even if the dollar long remains king, it will not always be such a powerful monarch. But an unforced debt default now could dramatically accelerate the process, costing Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in higher interest payments on public and private debt over the coming decades.</p><p></p><p>Ironically, the debt-ceiling fight is not really about debt. The Republicans are hardly debt hawks when they control things. The last Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, and his vice-presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, campaigned in 2012 on a programme that would likely have added trillions of dollars to the US debt over the next 10 years, owing to tax cuts and increased defence spending. Rather, the debt-ceiling debate is about the size and reach of government.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the US should worry about its soaring public debt – and about the rising pension and healthcare costs that are fuelling it. Despite baseless politically motivated claims to the contrary, the academic research still overwhelmingly suggests that very high debt is a drag on long-term growth.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Americans should worry just as much about the quality of education and infrastructure – not to mention the natural environment – that they are leaving to future generations. But, above all, they need to leave a legacy of civil political decision-making. That essential feature of effective government is now at risk.</p><p></p><p>• <em>Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist of the IMF, is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University</em></p><p></p><p>Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2013.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">www.project-syndicate.org</a></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418869191|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|fa339b0b9b687883d617c1529af9b082942a235a -->",

        "body":"<p>For US political obsessives, the shutdown of the US government induces a double deja vu. Republicans refusing to budge on the budget; a Democratic president stubbornly defending his programme; the federal government having to go into deep hibernation because it cannot pay its bills – all of it is oddly familiar. Viewers of the West Wing have seen it all before, thanks to the episode they called <a href=\"http://westwing.wikia.com/wiki/Shutdown\" title=\"\">Shutdown</a>.</p><p>But for some of us, that episode itself – with Leo, Josh and Toby pacing around a skeletally staffed White House – brought back memories, for it was based, like so much else of the West Wing, on the real-life events of the Clinton administration, including the two notorious government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. As it happens, I was this paper's Washington correspondent at the time – and I remember them well.</p><p>The shutdowns lasted no more than 28 days, but they had a lasting and, in one case dramatically unforeseen, impact on US politics. They damaged the reputation of one American leader – and set in train a series of events that might have ended up costing Bill Clinton the presidency.</p><p>The first impact was on the Republican party. In 1995, it was riding high: landslide victories in the 1994 congressional elections had given it control of the House and Senate. The new House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, interpreted his win as a demand from voters to roll back the state. A humbled Clinton was forced to declare: \"The era of big government is over.\"</p><p>But when the Republicans cut off funding and shut down the federal machine things changed. Suddenly the US public realised how much they needed their supposedly hated government and its despised bureaucrats. Emblematic were <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2011/0407/Government-shutdown-101-What-does-it-mean-for-veterans\" title=\"\">the military veterans</a> who were now unable to get their benefit cheques. By the time the shutdowns were over, the Republican revolution was stalled – and \"government\" was seen in a gentler light.</p><p>That damaged Gingrich, especially when he let slip that he had forced a shutdown partly because he was affronted that Clinton had seated him at the back of Air Force One on a long return flight to Israel for the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin. The New York Post branded him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/25/newt-cry-baby-gingrich\" title=\"\">a cry baby</a> and Gingrich's decline had begun.</p><p>Clinton emerged a winner. But the seeds of future trouble had been sown. During the 1995 shutdown, unpaid interns had taken on tasks normally performed by staff who'd had to be sent home. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/6narritii.htm\" title=\"\">One of those interns</a> brought the president pizza and the two got chatting. Her name? Monica Lewinsky.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418750736|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|77f4e113786db43831f4aafbddc79361ca7742a2 -->",

        "body":"<p>As the US shutdown enters its fourth day, more than 700,000 federal workers are still at home without pay, Barack Obama has scrapped his long-planned trip to Asia, and the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite national park are shuttered up. These effects were predicted from previous shutdowns – but what are some of the unforeseen effects on the economy?</p><p></p><h2>Jobs data cancelled</h2><p>Friday should have been a red-letter day for economists and investors, who were keenly awaiting the latest US jobs numbers. The non-farm payrolls report, a snapshot of the health of the world's biggest economy, is hotly anticipated around the world, but has now been postponed.</p><p></p><p>Economists polled by Reuters think the US created 180,000 new jobs in September – before the shutdown began draining confidence out of the economy – but everyone will have to wait longer to know for sure.</p><p></p><p>CMC markets analyst Michael Hewson said: \"Concerns about the US economy are growing, making it much less likely that we will see the start of any Fed tapering this year. After all, with no data to analyse, as well as adjustments in the coming months to compensate for the disruption, it will be much harder for the central bank to arrive at any meaningful conclusions as to the state of the US economy, as well as the extent of any damage the shutdown has done to it.\"</p><p></p><h2>Wall Street reform delayed (again)</h2><p>The shutdown is bad news for attempts to reform the US financial system, as implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act gets kicked deeper into the long grass. Dodd-Frank, an ambitious attempt to overhaul the US financial system in the wake of the crisis, was passed three years ago, but implementation has been snail-like, with <a href=\"http:/http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/19/obama-dodd-frank-regulation-act\" title=\"\">more than 60% of deadlines missed</a>. Now, as the Washington Post reports, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has said <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/10/02/21-surprising-effects-of-the-government-shutdown-you-havent-heard-about/\" title=\"\">it won't work on implementation during the shutdown.</a></p><p></p><h2>American debt more risky</h2><p>Investors are getting increasingly antsy that the shutdown could trigger a US debt default, if the government fails to hike its debt limit by a 17 October deadline.</p><p>Following the US treasury's stark warning that a debt default would have catastrophic effects on the American economy, as bad as or worse then the 2008 financial crisis, the costs of insuring against such an event rose on Thursday. The yield on short-term US treasury debt was up, a sign that investors consider them less safe.</p><p>As our live blogger Graeme Wearden <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/04/us-shutdown-deadlock-hits-stock-markets-live#block-524e9314e4b0be95974ca184\" title=\"\">points out in Friday's business live blog</a>: \"The cost of insuring US debt against default has inched up to a new two-year high. Data from Markit shows that a one-year credit default swap (which would pay out if the US were to default on a 12-month bond) has risen by seven basis points to 58bps (Reuters flags up). That's the highest rate since the last time America came close to hitting its debt ceiling … However, 58bps is still a very cheap price to pay insurance on a sovereign default. In practice, it means it costs $58,000 to insure $10m of US 12-month debt, up from $51,000 yesterday.\"</p><p></p><h2>Helicopter engineers sent home</h2><p>United Technologies, a supplier of helicopters and engines to the US military, has told nearly 2,000 workers to stay at home on Monday. If the shutdown continues into next week, that number could double and the maker of Black Hawk helicopters is warning that <a href=\"http://www.utc.com/News/Archive/2013/United+Technologies+Announces+Government+Shutdown+Impact?Page=1&amp;channel=/News\" title=\"\">more than 5,000 of its workers could be sent home </a>if the political stalemate drags into next month.</p><p></p><h2>Longer queues at the borders</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa\" title=\"\">British</a> and German governments have warned their citizens to expect longer waiting times at the US border and delays in getting visas. Although consular services are unaffected, the state department has said they would only remain open as long as \"there are sufficient fees to support operations\", <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/29/20745618-a-government-shutdown-what-could-it-look-like?lite\" title=\"\">NBC</a> reported.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419059224|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|0e13eacdddf594ab938d9e3ad49e6edce8073479 -->",

        "headline":"Will the government shutdown hurt your investment portfolio?",
        "body":"<p>If you're following the headlines, you'll know that the prospect of a longer-than-expected government shutdown is making financial markets uneasy at best and turbulent at worst.</p><p>Without a crystal ball, it's hard to predict what kind of toll the shutdown will take on investments.</p><p>That's why you'll need to tear your attention away from the Washington melodrama and pay keen attention to what companies say about earnings and outlook when the third-quarter \"reporting season\" kicks into full gear next week. The market chatter surrounding those announcements will be full of the usual Wall Street jargon about beats, misses, guidance and visibility.</p><p>Here's what you need to know: the 2013 stock market rally has pushed the S&amp;P 500 index up 18.1% so far, even though corporate profits are growing at less than a third of that pace. If corporate profits are really flagging, the consequences for individual stocks – or the market as a whole – could be … uncomfortable.</p><p>That makes this earnings season a great opportunity to examine your investments. Here's a primer.</p><p><strong>Beat or miss?</strong></p><p>In any earnings season, the key question is whether a company pulled off an earnings \"beat\" or delivered a \"miss\".</p><p>In plain English, that boils down to whether the company's profits for the quarter were better than analysts anticipated, or whether  they fell short of the mark.</p><p>Companies usually manage this delicate dance by hinting their earnings might be lower, so that the markets are pleasantly surprised when they do better. That's a \"beat\".</p><p>Over the last four quarters, two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 companies have beaten expectations, notes Greg Harrison, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters and one of a handful of folks on Wall Street whose task it is to monitor this information.</p><p>But not all \"beats\" are created equal. \"If a company reports a smaller loss than expected, that is technically a beat, but it's hardly a good thing,\" says Harrison. </p><p><strong>Positive surprises</strong></p><p>A good \"positive surprise\" is one that represents a big gain over last year's results, Harrison says. </p><p>Of late, he's noted that these positive surprises have been slightly smaller, in percentage terms, than they have been historically. They're also coming only after analysts have lowered their expectations in the weeks and months leading up to the quarterly announcement.</p><p>Sometimes companies attempt to use a positive surprise – even if it's below the original forecast – as a deliberate strategy to generate a big 'pop' in their stock price. But when many companies do this, it's less likely that gamesmanship is to blame; that surprise might not be so positive.</p><p>It may be a sign worth worrying about: that companies' or analysts' initial forecasts were too optimistic, overestimating the ability to turn in good profits.</p><p>Already, the outlook isn't great, as measured by corporate \"pre-announcements\", or early warnings by companies that their earnings won't measure up. \"It's very negative; the second-most negative rate we have seen in the last ten years,\" says Harrison.</p><p><strong>Why earnings have to grow</strong></p><p>That's significant because economists predicted early this year that earnings growth would be sluggish in the first six months of 2013, but that they would rebound in the second half. Things should be picking up by now.</p><p>If earnings growth stalls at its current level, however, investors could get skittish. Currently, Thomson Reuters predicts that third-quarter profits will grow 4.6% over last year's levels. Odds are that the actual figure will fall short of forecasts made back in January.</p><p><strong>What to watch for</strong></p><p>It's hard to trade around an individual company's earnings report, and most veterans suggest you leave that to the pros.</p><p>This quarter, you'll want to keep a particularly keen eye on how earnings releases compare to analysts' estimates as well as to any guidance that companies offer up in their press releases.</p><p><strong>Are things changing?</strong></p><p>It's more important than ever to keep an eye open for hints that companies are worried. Throughout a weak economic recovery, companies have managed to turn in strong results. If they're not doing well, it's a sign that the economy might get even worse. That's especially true in light of the shutdown, the tenuous economic recovery and the mediocre earnings growth at many companies so far this year.</p><p>\"It's harder than usual to get a sense of what will happen to earnings in the next quarter,\" says Harrison.</p><p>And watch that portfolio. Without clarity, or an obvious sign to justify the market's confidence in an earnings boost, the party may be ending. Some of the market's big gains may be in jeopardy.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418986040|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|ae34efc9653aa25f548fbf01a7e72cf37c82fcbe -->",

This last year, they finally got a launch date: 12 October. They hired an outfitter, bought plane tickets, arranged for shuttles, food, equipment. Katy had been working out everyday to get ready to steer her raft through the biggest rapids in the country:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>I just have to believe Congress will figure a way through their budget mess.</p></blockquote><p>But Congress wasn't able to figure a way through their budget mess, and on Tuesday morning – the 123rd birthday of Yosemite – all 401 of the United States' national parks and monuments, along with millions of acres managed by other federal agencies, furloughed their employees and closed their gates. End result: no visits to the World War II Memorial, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island. No walk throughs at the Golden Gate national recreation area, or hiking the trails in Yellowstone's 2m-acre wilderness. It means no rafting the Grand Canyon, or boating the Everglades. </p><p>The Park Service estimates that on a typical October day, more than 700,000 visitors come through its parks and monuments, many of them after planning their trip for years. Janice had planned to get married on the rim of Crater Lake ever since she was 15. Thirty-seven now, she and her fiancé just moved their wedding to their backyard, afraid the parks will still be closed by mid October – \"We just couldn't take the chance.\"</p><p>And as the visitors vanish, so does their money. By some estimates, local towns surrounding the parks and monuments stand to lose over $30m for each day the parks remain closed. That's a huge hit to the outfitters, tourist guides, mechanics, gas station attendants, ice cream vendors, teeshirt printers, artists, hotel owners, maids, booksellers, caterers, and waitresses. On and on the ripples go, and where it stops …</p><p>Another large ripple of this government shutdown are the 20,000 furloughed Park Service employees. Another still, the concession staff who check you in at the lodges, clean your room, cook your meals, lead your mule down the narrow paths to the Colorado river, and all manner of other work. These are generally lower-paying, private-sector jobs, and not many of the employees will be able to hang around waiting for work.</p><p>Which leads me to conclude one thing. The people who say, \"It's no big deal if the government closes for a while\" – or, as Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann candidly claimed, \"We are just giddy about it\" – need to understand government is not just some rotten tooth that needs extraction. Government is sinew and fiber, intertwined with our country's body. Extracting it has repercussions. Big ones. </p><p>The good news is that when parks close, people notice. In 1995, a huge hew-and-cry broke out when people realized they no longer had access to \"their parks\". Governor Fyfe Simington of Arizona even sent the Arizona national guard out to try to keep the Grand Canyon open. </p><p>And now, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/02/wwii-memorial-veterans-political-pawns\">cry is erupting over the closure of the World War II memorial</a>. Perhaps, once Bachmann and her ilk get done being all giddy about the government closure, they will remember they were elected to make this country better, not worse.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418975856|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|536116e19dcf23b693eca869abf74ae737d1245e -->",

        "headline":"Americans blame Republicans most for the government shutdown",
        "body":"<p>Many analysts and pundits are trying to figure out who the public is blaming for the shutdown. All the pre-shutdown <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/budget.htm\">polling indicated</a> that people were more likely to hold <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> accountable than <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/democrats\">Democrats</a>, but it also shows a majority of Americans think <em>both sides</em> are doing a bad job. Put another way: no side is winning, one side is just losing by less.</p><p>More Americans disapprove than approve of the job being done by all three actors in the dispute over the federal budget. President Obama comes out \"ahead\" in the <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/budget.htm\">ABC News/Washington Post poll</a> with a -9pt approval rating. Both parties in Congress are much lower. Democrats in Congress manage to maintain a net approval of -22pt, while Republicans in Congress fall to a -37pt approval rating. These are all awful.</p><p>CNN/ORC tries to get at the question slightly differently, yet their data yield a similar result. When given the opportunity, Americans don't like either side. Of Americans who would blame either President Obama, or Republicans in Congress, or both, in the event of a shutdown, 62% blame Republicans. President Obama is on slightly better ground, but still 52% afford him some blame.</p><p>This extends to the overall political atmosphere in Washington, DC these days. Just a quarter of Americans believe the country is heading in the right direction per a <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/right.htm\">recent Bloomberg poll</a> – the lowest recorded by Bloomberg's pollster since the company's first poll in 2009. With both parties holding sway in at least part of a branch of elected government, it's no wonder that Americans seem at a loss for which side to chastise. Now, with the shutdown, both parties are spiraling to new lows in the minds of the public.</p><p>A new <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/dem.htm\">CNN/ORC poll</a> puts the net favorability rating of the Democratic party at -9pt: its lowest since CNN started asking the question in 2006. Republicans, too, are at <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/rep.htm\">their lowest level</a> since 2006 as well, with -30pt favorability. A large portion of the difference between the parties' favorability is that Tea Party supporters are less likely to hold a favorable view of Republicans than Tea Party opponents are of Democrats.</p><p>The numbers are much worse for members of Congress. A new Quinnipiac survey has the Democrats in Congress sporting a -28pt approval rating. Republicans are even worse, at a -57pt net approval rating. Again, much of the difference between the two parties' ratings is that much of the conservative base doesn't think that congressional Republicans are <em>conservative enough</em>.</p><p>Putting together the disapprovals of both sides, it leads to a congressional net approval rating of -77pt in the latest <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/CongJob1.htm\">CNN survey</a>. That's down 19pt since the beginning of the month, and it's the worst CNN has recorded since 2006.</p><p>The executive branch is in a somewhat better position, though only because the White House's disapprovals don't stink quite as much. President Obama has a -9pt net approval rating <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/obama_job2.htm#CNN\">per CNN</a>. That's tied with his worst levels during the debt ceiling debate in 2011, and marks a continuation of his year-long decline. </p><p>So, our hypothetical voters are left with a choice between undesirables. It's possible that these unwanted choices become even more intolerable over the course of the shutdown, though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/24/republicans-government-shutdown-obama\">history suggests otherwise</a>.</p><p>Even if the shutdown proves not to move public opinion significantly, the current atmosphere is far from sunny. Now, does this mean that voters will fight back and elect third-party or independent candidates? Almost certainly not. The United States is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger's_law\">two-party system</a>. There have been other instances where Americans weren't happy with one or both parties, yet the structure held.</p><p>The fact is, we have a choice between Democrats and Republicans. Voters don't like either side, but this distaste will likely continue to manifest itself only in their opinions, and not in their underlying voting habits.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418895098|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|c081eeff0db1ad276e3392f6fb9188a6f851e71f -->",

        "headline":"US shutdown: what will happen and who will it affect?",
        "body":"<p><strong>How is the shutdown affecting  the US economy?</strong></p><p>The most direct impact is that 800,000 federal workers, at agencies as diverse as Nasa and the US Treasury, have been \"furloughed\" – in other words, sent home without pay. Since the pay of public sector workers counts as government spending in official calculations of the size of the economy, every dollar of earnings forgone will feed into third-quarter GDP.</p><p>Goldman Sachs has estimated that each day of shutdown means $400m (£250m) knocked off economic output in lost pay alone. In total, it says, economic growth will be cut by 0.2% points by a week-long shutdown. Some of that would be made up in later quarters if workers were given backpay to make up what they've lost, but that would require legislation.</p><p>The longer the closure goes on, however, the more likely it will do wider economic damage, as those sidelined public sector workers tighten their belts, companies which rely on federal contracts become more nervous  and consumers fret about the risks of a prolonged budget crisis. Danny Gabay, of City consultancy Fathom, said: \"The only certainty is that the US economy currently does not have the luxury of just 'taking time off'.\"</p><p></p><p><strong>Have the markets panicked?</strong></p><p>Not exactly. Initially, Wall Street reacted quite calmly, as investors calculated that even a brief shutdown could prompt the Federal Reserve to postpone any decision to start phasing out its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing scheme. Since markets love the cheap money the Fed pumps out through QE, they saw a postponement of so-called \"tapering\" as good news.</p><p>By Friday, however, when the shutdown had proved to be more than a 24-hour flash in the pan, investors had begun fretting about the deadline of 17 October, by which time Congress must agree an increase in the government's debt ceiling or Washington may start to default on some of its debts. That had seemed unthinkable, but the poisonous political standoff over the shutdown made it seem like a real possibility. Perhaps not surprisingly, the yield, or interest rate, on short-term government bonds jumped: a signal that investors had begun pricing in a tiny risk of default. Jack Lew, Barack Obama's treasury secretary, warned in an article that \"if the US cannot pay its bills in full and on time, each and every American will be affected\".</p><p></p><p><strong>How about the rest of the world?</strong></p><p>Again, it depends how long the crisis lasts. A few days of unpaid gardening leave for 800,000 employees in a total workforce of more than 155 million is unlikely to have a devastating effect on consumer spending, or on America's demand for imports from foreign producers, but if some form of default cannot be avoided it could spark financial chaos, which would ripple out through world markets, including London.</p><p></p><p><strong>How does this look to America's creditors?</strong></p><p>It's a fair guess they are not impressed. After the last debt ceiling debacle in 2011, which cost the US its AAA credit rating, China, which holds more than $1tn in IOUs from Washington, urged America to \"cure its addiction to debt\", and \"re-establish the commonsense principle that one should live within one's means\". It has since been taking more rapid steps towards floating the yuan, which would remove the need for Beijing to pile up such vast reserves of American assets as it strives to keep its currency cheap. City analysts say that is a deliberate policy. Simon Derrick, of BNY Mellon, said: \"The only way to avoid lending more money to the US is to stop accumulating reserves in the first place. This seems to be the real significance of current events.\"</p><p>In the longer term, the absence of a keen buyer for US bonds in China could push up the cost of borrowing for America significantly.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419146819|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|feafd454d4aa3d47a6b222a84325a44d3063722b -->",

        "headline":"US employers slashing worker hours to avoid Obamacare insurance mandate",
        "body":"<p>Avita Samuels has worked at the Mall of America in Minneapolis for the last four years, juggling a sales job with her studies in political science and law at the University of Minnesota. The 24-year-old has been the top sales associate for the last three years and works between 29 and 35 hours a week. But over the past few months, she said, she has watched as friends working in stores around her have their hours and benefits slashed – and she's worried that she will be next.</p><p>Forever 21, the clothing store, told staff last month in a memo leaked to the press that it planned to cut hours and reclassify some full-time workers as part- time. The move, which the company denied had anything to do with President Barack Obama's health reforms, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), will nevertheless help it avoid a mandate under the legislation requiring companies with 50 or more employees to offer those working 30 hours a week or more health insurance. Earlier this month, Seaworld, which operates 11 entertainment parks across the US, capped hours for part time workers at 28, down from 32, <a href=\"http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/os-seaworld-part-time-workers-hours-20130909,0,6129525.story\">according to the Orlando Sentinel</a>.</p><p>Other retailers, such as Trader Joe's and Home Depot have said they will no longer provide medical coverage for part-time employees, and will shift them instead to the public healthcare exchanges which open Tuesday, 1 October. Some employers have said their health costs will rise as a result of various provisions of the ACA, which takes full effect in 2015, when larger companies have to provide health benefits to full time workers or pay a $2,000 per-person fine.</p><p>The trend has caused fears among low-paid workers living on the breadline that they will be hit twice – by having their hours and thus earnings cut and by having to pay more for healthcare. Based on what she said is happening in the stores around her, Samuels is concerned she too will have her hours cut and with it her eligibility for company healthcare under the ACA.</p><p>\"It's a really scary situation,\" said Samuels, who earns $9.25 an hour and is trying to reduce a student loan debt of close to $50,000. She currently receives subsidised healthcare through her university, but it runs out next year, when she had hoped her employer healthcare would kick in.</p><p>\"Technically, I should be eligible,\" she said. \"But at least 20 stores around me have cut hours. I live paycheck to paycheck. I have credit card debts. It's a balancing act. I'm afraid I won't be able to afford healthcare.\"</p><p>As one of the nation's lowest-paid workers, with little job security, Samuels is not alone in her fears that she may be worse off when the ACA takes full effect.</p><p>Following a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/13/hourly-worker-benefits-cut-callout\">callout to hourly workers</a> who had experienced recent changes in hours or health benefits, the Guardian was contacted by employees and their families. Two of them said they were so concerned about additional costs of healthcare, they were considering not buying insurance at all.</p><p>Typing Samuel's average earnings of $15,000 a year and her state into the <a href=\"http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=mn&amp;zip=5545&amp;income-type=dollars&amp;income=15000&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=1&amp;adult-count=1&amp;adults[0][age]=21&amp;adults[0][tobacco]=0&amp;child-count=0&amp;child-tobacco=0\">subsidy calculator</a> on the Kaiser Family Foundation website, reveals that, if her employer did not offer healthcare and she were to enter a healthcare exchange, she would be eligible for government subsidy and would pay $300 a year towards the $1,449 cost of a plan. Samuels, who is already struggling financially, said this will represent a massive additional burden should her hours be cut by her employer.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://www.ifebp.org/Resources/Research/empsponsoredhcimpact13.htm\">survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans</a> published last month, found that 15% of large employers (50 or more employees) and 20% of smaller employers had plans to adjust hours so that fewer employees qualify for full-time medical insurance under the ACA.</p><p>Kavita Patel, a fellow in economic studies at the Brooking Institution who worked on healthcare reform in the White House, said: \"The big question everyone is asking is: 'Will it increase the premiums?' If you are being dropped by your employer and you are going into the exchanges, it depends on how much much money you are making. In New York, for instance, the rate in the exchange is cheaper than the group markets.\"</p><p>The Kaiser Family Foundation published a <a href=\"http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/an-early-look-at-premiums-and-insurer-participation-in-health-insurance-marketplaces-2014/\">report </a>earlier this month which worked out the cost of premiums in 17 states plus DC.</p><p>To hourly workers, many of whom are living below the poverty line, a small increase in healthcare costs can represent the final straw for their already stretched family budgets.</p><p>The wife of a Trader Joe's part-time worker who contacted the Guardian in response to a callout said her husband was so concerned about potential cost increases, he was considering not buying healthcare insurance at all. </p><p>The mother of two, who did not want her name published, said: \"My husband is debating getting insurance which scares me as the job is physical so there is always a risk of on site injuries that require medical attention. We are expecting to pay more out of pocket. We are working on putting aside some now so we can afford coverage next year.</p><p>\"I am worried there will be months when we will have to choose paying health insurance or paying a bill. Neither is a good option with two children to think of.\"</p><p>People without health coverage in 2014 may have to pay a fine of up to $95 per person and 100% of their healthcare costs.</p><p>She told the Guardian that she and her children had been covered by her husband's company, Trader Joe's, until he was informed in August that, as a part-time worker of 30 hours or less, his healthcare benefits would no longer be paid when the ACA comes into effect. An internal memo by Trader Joe's announced that each affected employee would be given $500 and said it hoped that \"many of you should be able to obtain healthcare coverage at very little if any net cost to you\".</p><p>A college student, she said her research had shown that the cost of an alternative plan would be greater than the $500 they will receive. Her husband previously paid $99 for coverage, she said.</p><p>She said she felt let down. \"Finding out that we were losing health benefits seems (coupled with the previous reduction in contributions to retirement) like the company has reached a size/level will it no longer makes sense to put employees first. This makes me very sad.\"</p><p>Unions and worker's organisation say that, at a time of growing concerns over the level of minimum wage earned by the nation's lowest paid workers, it is the same workers who are being worst hit by the changes, ahead of the ACA.</p><p>David Wehde, organising director of Working America, an affiliate of AFL-CIO with three and a half million members, said: \"What we are hearing from our workers is a lot of frustration, particularly lower wage workers in retail or service jobs.\"</p><p>However, Wahde said there is \"huge scepticism\" of the claims made by some employers that they had been forced to make changes in benefits because of the costs of the ACA.</p><p>\"Our workers are frustrated, saying that their employers don't have to do it this way, but they are just using the ACA as an excuse\" said Wehde. \"It is not winning workers' trust.\"</p><p>Janna Pea, the deputy communications director of the Retail Wholesale and Department Stores Union, said the shift some employers were taking towards part time workers was an unfortunate side effect of the ACA.</p><p>Pea said: \"We are hearing from our members who are concerned about what is happening with their companies. Not only are they looking at having their healthcare coverage cut they are also looking at less hours.\"</p><p>\"You have a trend where employers are saying they have no obligation to do anything for anybody who works less than 30 hours a week. Part of the act created incentives for employers to take away benefits from employees. It is an unfortunate side effect. The act ignores part time workers.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418678780|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|17edcc97d7ce9607acd64d70541649dc1a360c1e -->",

        "body":"<p>The US government has gone into shutdown after the failure to approve funding for the next financial year. Nonessential services will be closed and 800,000 federal employees will not be allowed to work – but while this is the first shutdown of the 21st century, it is far from unprecedented. Here is what has happened in the past:</p><h2>1996 – Clinton v Republicans</h2><p>There have been 18 <a href=\"http://images.businessweek.com/extras/11/02/ShutdownFedGovt95.906.doc.pdf\" title=\"shutdown pdf\">shutdowns since 1976 (pdf)</a>, but none for 17 years until Monday's midnight deadline to extend Congressional spending authority passed with no agreement. The last occasion was when Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled House halted services for a total of 21 days. It began in November 1995, a temporary spending bill was enacted, but then the shutdown restarted in mid-December and ran into 1996. The first shutdown resulted in 800,000 workers eventually getting paid for staying home and the second led to 280,000 workers left idle for three weeks. The Republicans took a drubbing in the polls and ended up accepting most of Clinton's conditions, making the president the adjudged winner of the tussle, even if the image of government as a whole suffered. A historic footnote is that the second day of the initial shutdown – 15 November 1995 – was when Monica Lewinsky said she began a sexual relationship with Clinton.</p><h2>1981-1990 – short shutdowns</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418736562'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380615664543/Ronald-Reagan-Waving-002.jpg' alt='Ronald Reagan Waving' width='140' height='215' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Reagan: Phil Huber/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>During Ronald Reagan's two terms he regularly argued with congressional Democrats to the brink of shutdown. The first occasion was in November 1981, nine months after he entered office. With Congress having approved emergency spending to keep the government running, Reagan wielded his first veto, making a stand against \"budget-busting policies\". Federal workers were streaming out of offices in Washington and across the nation but it lasted only hours as Congress approved a three-week spending extension that was more to the president's liking. The estimated cost of the shutdown was more than $80m. Workers were sent home for half a day twice more during his presidency. George Bush used the tactic once, during the budget wrangling that punctured his \"no new taxes\" pledge, leading to a partial shutdown over the 1990 Columbus Day weekend.</p><h2>1980 – Carter and his attorney general</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418736564'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380616206445/Jimmy-Carter-002.jpg' alt='Jimmy Carter' width='140' height='215' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Carter: Dirck Halstead/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>When Jimmy Carter asked his attorney general for legal advice, Benjamin Civiletti told the president that government employees could not work for free or with the expectation that they would be paid at some undefined point in the future, despite a \"look-the-other-way\" system having worked for decades. Civiletti went further, declaring that any agency chief who broke the law would be prosecuted. When five days later funding for the Federal Trade Commission expired amid a congressional disagreement over limiting the agency's powers, the FTC halted operations, cancelling court dates and meetings and sending 1,600 workers packing, apparently the first agency ever closed by a budget dispute. Embarrassed, Congress made a quick fix and the FTC reopened the next day. The estimated cost of the brouhaha was $700,000.</p><p>Carter, forever stymied by his own party in Congress, ordered the whole government to be ready to shut down when the budget year ended on 1 October 1980, in case the deadline for appropriations bills was missed. It almost happened. Funding for many agencies did expire, but just for a few hours, and nobody was sent home. Civiletti later clarified that in a government-wide shutdown, the military, air traffic control, prisons and other work that protects human safety or property would continue. So would things such as social security benefits, which Congress has financed indefinitely.</p><h2>Earlier 1900s – a time before full shutdowns</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418736563'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/7/20/1374333823208/henry-ford-010.jpg' alt='henry ford' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Henry Ford in the early 1900s. Photograph: Superstock/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Congress routinely failed to pass most of each year's dozen or so appropriations bills on time, with agencies sometimes going a full year without a budget. Usually it would be smoothed over with a short-term money approval, called a continuing resolution. Even when these got delayed due to wrangling, government agencies did not shut down. Agency chiefs might delay workers' pay and put items such as travel and new contracts on hold but they assumed Congress did not want them to turn off the lights and go home. Eventually a spending bill would be passed that retroactively papered over the funding gap.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418710740|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|df4857098bbeffa5adb518e0f209169fde85ee78 -->",

        "body":"<p>About 94% of the employees of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been sent on leave of absence as part of the US government shutdown.</p><p>Nearly all of the agency's 16,205 employees across the country, with oversight of air quality, industrial waste, water and sewage treatment plants, have powered down their computers, updated their voicemail, filled in their last timesheets, and left buildings as part of the shutdown.</p><p>Only 1,069 essential staff – such as emergency personnel who deal with  events posing an \"imminent threat to human life\" such as chemical spills or rail derailments– remained on duty. A few workers also stayed behind to feed lab animals, and water test plants.</p><p>EPA officials said the shutdown would disrupt monitoring of air and water quality.</p><p>It could also set back the agency's efforts to advance Barack Obama's climate change agenda.</p><p>Employees are barred from checking government email, using government-issued cellphones during the furlough, or catching up on any of their work for the duration of the shutdown.</p><p>\"It stinks,\" said John O'Grady, a union representative at the EPA's Chicago office. \"No one is going to be out inspecting water discharges, or wet lands. Nobody is going to be out inspecting waste water treatment plants, drinking water treatment plants, or landfills – nothing. None of that is going to be done. The employees are absolutely devastated.\"</p><p>He said most employees at the EPA had already lost about six days' pay due to leave since last April, and pay scales have been frozen since 2010.</p><p>The EPA is a prime target for the Republicans in Congress, who precipitated the government shutdown, because of its moves to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.</p><p>EPA officials had warned earlier that a shutdown could hurt Obama's climate change agenda. The agency was about to roll out new rules for promoting the use of biofuels, and tougher penalties against polluters.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/20/epa-limit-us-coal-plant-pollution\" title=\"\">EPA was also working to set the first limits on carbon pollution from power plants</a> – the pillar of Obama's climate change agenda. Those rules are still on course for release in June 2014 – but some Republicans on Tuesday still cheered the prospect of a shuttered EPA.</p><p>\"There is some good news out of the shutdown, the EPA can't issue new regulations,\" Marsha Blackburn, a member of Congress from Tennessee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/385047819301552130\" title=\"\">said on Twitter</a>.</p><p>But EPA officials said there would be growing risk to public health if the shutdown lasted beyond a few days.</p><p>\"It's like most of the other agencies. In the short term, the impact may not be terribly big, but over the long term, there is a cost to the work not getting done,\" said Jonathan Schweitzer, an environmental engineer at the agency and a veteran of the 1990s shutdown.</p><p>During the last shutdown, his team was forced to call off a planned inspection at a sewage treatment plant in the Chicago area. \"During that time the treatment plant violated its discharge limits,\" he said. \"In the long term if we can't review permits and pre-treatment programmes, then states and municipalities will likely tend to slack off if nobody is keeping after them as far as their job is concerned protecting the waterways.\"</p><p>Other environmental agencies are being affected by the shutdown – but only Nasa, the lead US government agency for climate science research, is taking a bigger hit than the EPA.</p><p>Just 3% of workers at Nasa remained on the job after Tuesday's shutdown. Nasa's website and Twitter feed, like those at other agencies, were also down.</p><p>But mission control for the six US astronauts at the international space station remained open, the agency said.</p><p>About half of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been sent home without pay – mainly those dealing with climate change and oceans.</p><p>Hurricane spotters will stay on the job – the season runs through 30 November – but tornado watchers have been sent on leave, <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/government-shutdown-affects-weather-climate-programs-16553\" title=\"\">Climate Central reported</a>.</p><p>Yosemite and other national parks and monuments were shut down, as was the panda cam at Washington's National zoo, as 81% of workers at the interior department were furloughed.</p><p>The Department of Energy (DoE) also sent 69% of its workers home, closing down research and energy efficiency programmes. Workers in charge of nuclear materials remained on the job, and so have staff at some of the DoE research labs for now.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418872030|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|9829249b0a98e3f8938975e3d2790eadeb51e750 -->",

        "headline":"Federal employees suddenly put out of work with no prospect of return date",
        "body":"<p>Hundreds of thousands of federal government employees across the United States were sent home on Tuesday, with little idea of when they would return to work or whether they would be paid.</p><p>The budget standoff between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, which led to the first partial shutdown of the US government in two decades, had very real consequences for workers around the country. The most common estimates say 800,000 employees would be sent home.</p><p>One of the worst affected government agencies in Washington was the US Department of Labor. Off the department's 16,000 workers, only around 3,000 have been deemed \"essential\" and therefore exempted from the shutdown. Thousands of workers filled the sidewalks from 11am onwards, after they had been instructed to go home.</p><p>The irony of employees of the Labor Department being laid off without pay was not lost on many of those who started streaming out of the doors on Tuesday. \"I work for the Department of Labor and they won't let me work,\" said one office worker who emerged carrying shoes she normally stores at the office. \"That's kinda sad.\"</p><p>Inside, two Labor Department chiefs – David Michaels, an assistant secretary, and his deputy, Jordan Barab – had just finished visiting every office to speak personally with staff. Barab did so despite being on crutches. The two men assured staff that they were important and apologised for the situation, according to several employees who came out immediately afterwards.</p><p>Like other government employees, Labor Department workers had been instructed to return to work on Tuesday to learn their fate. On arrival, they attended meetings by department supervisors, who told them whether or not they were needed for work. Then all that was left was to turn on out-of-office alerts on their emails and voicemail messages on their desk phones, turn off their computers at the socket and complete their timesheets.  </p><p>Department employees were told to state that they had worked just four hours on Tuesday, and then add \"UF\" – code for furloughed – on the timesheets. \"There was no sense when we might come back,\"  said Lisa Long, 45, a safety engineer. \"People were demoralised and maybe even a little shocked that it was actually happening.\"</p><p>The impact of the shutdown is not only being felt by the hundreds of thousands of employees who suddenly find themselves out of work; the consequences ripple out further. On Tuesday, the hot-dog trucks that usually stationed outside the rear entrance of the Francis Perkins Building building were gone. Nearly all of the restaurants that cater for office-workers were closed. </p><p>Employees in the Labor building include some well-paid senior officials, as well as others on annual salaries as low as $25,000. \"These people need paychecks, they gotta eat,\" said Monique Tribbett, a 45-year-old IT contractor. \"I'm trying to get people to protest. Not just people in the department but, you know, all these other people who are affected. If we all went, right now, to the steps of the Capitol building and protested then they might start listening to us, but people don't want to stand together. I feel like I'm on my own.\" </p><p>It was a similar story across the US. In New York, Miriam Allen was summoned into her office in the Jacob Javits federal building for two hours on Tuesday to \"close up [her] work station\". She said: \"I put a voicemail on the telephone and put an out-of-office on the computer. I watered the plants, I cleaned the refrigerator, and I got my personal effects.\"</p><p>Allen, who is three years from retirement, works on homeless assistance programs for the Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development. She and her colleagues had watched a webcast on Monday in which the department's secretary, Shaun Donovan, warned that if a budget was not passed by midnight they would have to come into work \"for at least one hour and no longer than four to settle our affairs\".</p><p>Allen said she was going to go back to her home in Queens – \"thankfully I paid my mortgage yesterday\" – and await news about returning to work.</p><p>\"I feel that my government has failed me as a taxpayer and as a federal employee. I feel that Congress should be totally abolished,\" she said. \"I don't blame the president at all. But the entire legislative branch is just dysfunctional.\"</p><p>In Texas, a federal employee who works in learning and education said that the shutdown had a marked effect on morale. The woman, who did not want her name to be published, said: \"Morale is low and faith in our management and leaders has faded. I am sick and frustrated with our elected officials. That their entire goal is to not run the country, but to stop 'the other side' from accomplishing anything is ludicrious and pathetic.\"</p><p>She warned that the consequences of the furlough extend beyond the federal workers themselves: \"Today, I am cleaning house and will pick up my kids from school today instead of paying our after-school care provider. She, too, will feel the loss of income.\"</p><p>An employee of the Department of Defense Education Activity, the civilian outreach arm of the defense department, told the Guardian of the despondent mood in her office. \"I was sent home today along with thousands of other Defense Civilians in our community. The mood was somber in my office, depressing in the post office – which closed before I could get my package out – and downright miserable over the dinner table. </p><p>\"My family and our financial hit is not more important than giving citizens access to basic health care ... but I could just punch the lawmakers who decided to marry my salary with a law that has already done its rounds in Congress and public debate.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418778559|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|3b22307c0a25b4e35fcdc2d6775db2bee816ad0c -->",

        "body":"<p>The 92 elderly war veterans who had travelled to Washington from the gulf coast of Mississippi were not going to let a manufactured political row in the United States Congress prevent them from paying tribute to their comrades.</p><p>They had come thousands of miles in four tour buses, many in wheelchairs, most of them frail, and all of them determined not to be held back by the barriers that closed off the World War II memorial.</p><p>Who let them past the barriers was unclear. <a href=\"http://www.stripes.com/news/wwii-veterans-storm-d-c-memorial-closed-by-government-shutdown-1.244447\">The Stars and Stripes reporter</a> said a congressman distracted a park police officer while other lawmakers and their staff moved the barricades aside. A cheer went up, and the men surged forward in an act of civil disobedience that captured growing public anger towards a dysfunctional Congress.</p><p>Like all federal monuments, national parks and museums across the US, the World War II memorial was closed on Tuesday, shuttered by the partial closure of government services that stemmed from the failure of Congress to pass a budget resolution by midnight on Monday that would have ensured their continued funding.</p><p>The breaching of the memorial barriers was a symbolic gesture. But for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, the government shutdown, blamed by President Obama on a hardline group of Republicans determined to wreck his healthcare reforms by \"holding the country to ransom\", is much more than a cheap stunt.</p><p>\"We don't know how long this is going to last and we've got no idea how we are gonna pay the bills,\" said Terry Baber, 55, an electrician, who admitted to be \"pretty ticked off\" as he emerged from the American history museum. Like all Smithsonian institutions in Washington, the museum will be closed for the duration of the shutdown. \"I've got a son in college and I've got to pay his room and board. We still have to eat. We still need fuel for our cars,\" he told the Guardian.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418952926'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380660494089/da9072ae-a863-4e11-b7f3-48b249015e08-460x276.jpeg' alt='Tourists look into the closed Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, a victim of the federal government shutdown.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tourists look into the closed Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, a victim of the federal government shutdown. Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>By mid-morning, downtown Washington DC had the throng of a busy lunchtime rush, as furloughed workers from all the major government buildings came out onto the streets after closing down their offices. Everywhere from obscure government agencies to the White House was operating on a slimmed-down staff, with all so-called \"non-excepted\" employees ordered to return home after turning up to work on Tuesday morning.</p><p>One woman, a chemist at the US environmental agency, was standing by the side of the road with five cardboard boxes filled with office plants. \"If we have to be gone for a month, I don't want to return to find them dead,\" she said. Like thousands of other workers, the woman, in her 50s, said she had been told to record a fresh voicemail message on her office phone, place out-of-office alert on her email, turn off her computer, and go home.</p><p>Furloughed employees were asked to sign copies of a letter from their human resources departments and ordered not to used any government equipment - including BlackBerrys - during the shutdown. Checking emails or making calls would be a disciplinary offence, they were were told. </p><p>The mayor of DC, Vincent Gray, declared all city staff as \"essential\" workers, a legally contentious measure. But it at least kept the city moving, and guarded America's capital from some of the more unpleasant consequences of the last shutdown in the mid-1990s, when trash was not collected and piled up on the street.</p><p>Across Washington's National Mall, and outside all of the main public monuments, bewildered-looking tourists had to resort viewing attractions from a distance - and taking photographs from outside. <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/e7RPOdBDpL/\">At the Lincoln memorial</a>, barricades were erected, and signs pinned to railings announcing \"Because of the federal government shutdown, all national parks are closed\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418952927'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380632450048/8c956944-9228-4f5f-9225-dd4266e72b5a-460x276.jpeg' alt='Lincoln memorial sealed off' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The Lincoln Memorial is sealed off from visitors in Washington as the US government began a partial shutdown on Tuesday. Photograph: Jason Re</figcaption></figure><p>The lights at the memorial quite literally went out, leaving the huge edifice of Abraham Lincoln in a dark shadow. Robert Smith, 56, who has manned a stall selling pins and badges to raise funds for veterans beside the memorial for the last 26 years, recalled the last shutdown, under President Clinton in 1996.</p><p>\"It wasn't as bad as this,\" he said. \"They weren't stopping buses coming through as they are now. All of us who do business round here are pretty upset.\"</p><p>Steve Cockerton, 58, from Colchester in the UK, was at the start of a three-day visit to Washington to see the monuments and museums, all of which are now closed. He only discovered there would be very little he could actually see when he read a copy of the Washington Post this morning.  \"I don't know much about American politics but it seems a little extreme to me – almost punitive,\" Cockerton, a social worker, said. </p><p>While visitors seemed perplexed at how the capital of the richest country on earth could grind to a halt, American tourists were seemingly more understanding. \"This is about the US constitution – we've had to compromise right from the very beginning,\" said Linda Skoien, 63, from Wisconsin. \"Even that man sitting there understood that,\" she added, pointing toward Lincoln.</p><p>Her friend also said she understood that \"this is how government functions from time to time\", but was more matter of fact. \"I grew up on a farm,\" she said. \"If something needs doing, you just get it done.\"</p><p>At the US Capitol, trash started to pile up in understaffed cafeterias, and the few remaining visitors were sent scurrying to find open security entrances.</p><p>Lawmakers, meanwhile, blamed each other for the crisis. A group of prominet House Republicans, led my majority leader Eric Cantor and onetime vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan, held a theatrical press conference in front of a row of empty chairs intended to represent missing Senate Democrats, who earlier rejected calls for formal talks while the GOP continues to hold Obamacare \"to ransom\".</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418952928'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380660294944/26090623-832a-470b-8b0d-8d74fe06e0b1-460x276.jpeg' alt='President Barack Obama  speaks in the ROse Garden of the White House alongside citizens who will benefit from the Affordable Care Act.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>President Barack Obama  speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House alongside citizens who will benefit from the Affordable Care Act. Photograph: Christy Bowe/Corbis</figcaption></figure><p>President Obama held a press conference in the equally theatrical White House Rose Garden to warn that the first shutdown in 17 years threatened lasting damage to the fragile US economy. \"As long as I am president I will not give in to reckless demands by the Republican party to deny health insurance to the millions of Americans that cannot afford it, he said.</p><p>With neither side showing any sign of backing down, the shutdown could continue until 17 October when Republicans hope that a separate deadline to renew government borrowing authority will bend the will of their opponents. </p><p>In the meantime, members of Congress will continue to be paid, unlike the federal workers locked out of their offices around the US. At 11am on Tuesday, Lori Stanislaus walked out of the Jacob K Javits federal building in lower Manhattan, New York, not knowing when she would return.  \"I don't know if I'm going to get paid,\" she said. \"We got a letter to give our creditors to show we're furloughed federal employees and please be flexible with us in paying our bills.\"</p><p>Stanislaus, 51, works as a human resources officer across three different federal agencies. She has been in the job 11 years and has never been furloughed before. \"It's a scary thing,\" she said. \"My husband is unemployed. I am the sole breadwinner for a family of five. So, yeah, I'd say on a scale of one to ten how scary is it? 12.\"</p><p>But Stanislaus had a clear idea of who to blame for the shutdown. \"The Tea Party assholes that put Obamacare on an appropriations bill need to be shot in the head. The Affordable Care Act is a law already. It's like some last-ditch effort to try to undo what has already been done.\"</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Adam Gabbatt in New York</em></p><p>• This article was amended on 3 October 2013 to correct the spelling of Paul Ryan's name, from Paul Ran.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418778073|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|49b2020fbc6f07c863a9436822d45f2f04f59617 -->",

        "headline":"US shutdown: Republicans threaten to take debt limit fight to the brink",
        "body":"<p>The White House has ruled out using a legal veto to force Congress to extend the US debt limit as conservative Republicans threaten to take what the Treasury described as a potentially catastrophic economic standoff to the brink of a 17 October deadline.</p><p>President Obama had been encouraged by senior Democrats to call the bluff of hardline Republicans who want to add a debt limit refusal to an existing spending impasse that has already shut down much of the federal government.</p><p>Some Democrats argue that powers granted under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which was introduced to control southern states after the civil war, would allow the president to unilaterally borrow money if there was such a threat to the credit-worthiness of the US.</p><p>\"Using the 14th would show the Republicans he means business,\" one former aide to Bill Clinton told the Guardian last week.</p><p>But the White House ruled out the option on Thursday, ending days of Washington debate about whether this obscure legal authority might provide a way out for Obama – at least from one half of Republicans' fiscal pincer movement. \"The administration does not believe the 14th amendment gives power to the president to ignore the debt ceiling,\" said spokesman Jay Carney.</p><p>\"The fact that there is significant controversy around the president's authority to act unilaterally means that it would not be a credible alternative to Congress raising the debt ceiling and would not be taken seriously by the market.\"</p><p>With options dwindling for forcing Republicans to drop their fight, Obama faces a protracted battle linking both spending and borrowing authority in a combined budget standoff.</p><p>Some conservative lawmakers are even questioning administration insistences that Congress must increase the debt limit by 17 October.</p><p>Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, one of several Republicans who first urged speaker John Boehner to link the budget with their demands to scrap healthcare reform, said the government shutdown may change the debt deadline by slowing down spending. \"I don't know if the drop dead date on the debt limit is going to be 17 October because the government is not spending any money now,\" he told the Guardian. \"This might get pushed back a little bit further.\"</p><p>Sensenbrenner also argued that public sympathy was shifting towards Republicans as the government shutdown wore on. \"What I'm hearing from the public, mostly from phone calls that we get here and in my Wisconsin office, is that for a while Republicans were getting blamed for stonewalling but after Sunday – when we sent five proposals over to the Senate – the pendulum is starting to swing the other direction,\" he said.</p><p>\"Where the public is at now is a lot different than in previous debt ceiling fights including August 2011. People are concerned about the debt because the debt has really ballooned and the president has got to be much more specific and convincing than just saying we've got to raise it so the government can pay its bills.\"</p><p>Earlier on Thursday, the US Treasury insisted that the shutdown would not affect its estimate of when the government would run out of cash, and warned that the US was heading toward a catastrophic event that could plunge the country into financial crisis.</p><p>A default would be unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic,\" Treasury said in a report. \"The negative spillovers could reverberate around the world, and there might be a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse,\" the report said.</p><p>A row over the debt ceiling in 2011 led to a historic downgrade of the US's debt and panic on stock markets worldwide. \"As we saw two years ago, prolonged uncertainty over whether our nation will pay its bills in full and on time hurts our economy,\" Lew said.</p><p>\"Postponing a debt ceiling increase to the very last minute is exactly what our economy does not need – a self-inflicted wound harming families and businesses. Our nation has worked hard to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, and Congress must act now to lift the debt ceiling before that recovery is put in jeopardy.\"</p><p>The report came as US investors appeared to be getting increasingly nervous about the impact of the government shutdown and the upcoming debt ceiling debate. The Dow was down more than 160 points in morning trading and has closed down eight of the last 10 trading days.</p><p>The Treasury report said that the last row over the debt ceiling, which was resolved at the 11th hour, had persistent, negative consequences on the wider economy. \"The financial markets stress that developed in August of 2011 persisted for many months. Then, as now, the economic expansion was vulnerable to adverse shocks,\" Treasury said.</p><p>Even the possibility of a default could decrease household wealth, increase borrowing costs and shake business confidence, the report said. \"In the event of a default, the US economy could be plunged into a recession worse than any seen since the great depression.\"  </p><p>The US dollar and Treasury securities are at the center of the international finance system. In the catastrophic event that a debt limit impasse were to lead to a default on Treasury securities, financial markets could be shaken to their core as was seen in late 2008,\" the Treasury said. </p><p>The Treasury reached its borrowing limit in May and has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to fund payments ever since. Treasury secretary Jack Lew expects to exhaust those measures by 17 October and the congressional budget office expects the nation could start defaulting on obligations by 22 October unless swift action is taken.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419013509|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|60d29635fa4089d9e5151921bbccbf85add9c13b -->",

        "headline":"Government shutdown: which agencies are next in line to close?",
        "body":"<p>We're nearly a week into US government's partial shutdown, which has seen the closure of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/29/us-government-shutdown-services-affected\"> numerous federal services</a> and the furlough of \"non-essential\" employees. Congress appears no closer to reaching an agreement, as still-functioning agencies deplete the surplus funds allowing them to operate.</p><p>The shutdown has put FDA's food inspectors on furlough, as well as most of Nasa, and it's caused the Department of Veterans Affairs already severe backlog of disability claims to get worse. Though some agencies are still operating as usual, the backup funds keeping them going could run out as early as next week.</p><h2><strong>Education</strong></h2><p>The Head Start pre-school program for 967,000 children from low-income families closed on shutdown day. Some states providing contingency funding to keep the programs in place, but five programs have closed so far, affecting more than 5,000 children. The program to close in Georgia is the largest known to have closed.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/10/03/by-tomorrow-5000-children-will-have-lost-head-start-since-the-shutdown-began/\">According to the Washington Post</a>, 23 Head Start programs were up for grant renewals the day the government shut down, including the five that closed.</p><p>Public schools will remain open, even though the Education Department is suspending most of its operations.</p><h2><strong>Domestic violence programs</strong></h2><p>Rape crisis programs and domestic violence shelters could start closing as early as Monday after the Office of Justice Programs stops disbursing funds on Friday. Each of these programs is reliant on federal funding to a different degree, and the amount of reserve funds can change on a county-by-county and state-by-state basis.</p><p>Julie Bornhoeft, a director at Weave, Sacramento's agency for victims of violence and sexual assault, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/10/04/2732211/domestic-violence-shutdown/\">told Think Progress</a> that its funding is diversified enough to provide some stability. However, Bornhoeft said: \"For an organization that is predominantly funded through federal grants or federally derived grants, even temporary disruption in cash flow will be detrimental.\"</p><h2><strong>The courts</strong></h2><p>The supreme court will hear its first arguments of the year on Monday, as scheduled. Judges are scheduled to hear six cases next week, including one on political campaign donation limits. The court's building will remain open to the public as normal and boasts one of <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov/\">the few functioning government websites</a>. These measures are only guaranteed through October 11, when an update will be provided if the government is still shut down.</p><p>Federal courts, however, only have funds to last through 15 October. Courts will then have to start furloughing employees, but US courts administrative office director <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-01/u-s-seeks-delay-of-civil-cases-as-government-shutdown-begins.html\">Judge John Bates said before the shutdown</a> that courts would still be able to handle most cases.</p><h2><strong>Veterans services</strong></h2><p>Most Department of Veterans Affairs services continue because the government pays for its health programs a year in advance. But the agency warned Congress in September that if the government shuts down for more than two or three weeks it will deplete its resources used to make compensation and pension payments. This limit was not included in a field guide to the shutdown for veterans, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/09/27/va-all-veterans-benefit-payments-will-be-disrupted-if-a-shutdown-goes-beyond-two-weeks/\">according to The Washington Post</a>. </p><h2><strong>Food programs</strong></h2><p>Funding for the WIC program, which provides low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children up to the age of five with food, has been cut short. The USDA initially said states have funds that could sustain the program for weeks, and multiple states confirmed on Thursday that surplus funds were being used to cover their programs through October. <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/rulesforengagement/2013/10/what_is_actually_happening_with_food_stamps_during_the_shutdown.html\">The agency told EdWeek</a> that the funds may not last past October.</p><p>The Snap food stamps program is funded through October and has $2bn in contingency funds available after that.</p><h2><strong>Patent and trademark office</strong></h2><p>The Commerce Department is responsible for issuing patents and trademark registration, and is operating as usual on reserve fees from last year. The <a href=\"http://www.uspto.gov/news/2013ops.jsp\">agency said it expects to operate normally</a> for approximately four weeks, but is assessing how it will operate after that time. The office will close if it runs out of reserve funds, while keeping a small staff on hand to accept new applications.</p><h2><strong>Immigration services</strong></h2><p>US Citizenship and Immigration Services runs on user fees and is still able to handle applications and keep appointments at local offices. Its e-verify program, which checks the immigration or citizenship status of new employees, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/everify-offline-shutdown-employers-hiring\">went offline with the shutdown</a>, but the government waived that requirement until the shutdown ends.</p><h2><strong>Amtrak</strong></h2><p>The country's dominant passenger rail service gets a considerable portion of its funding from the US government, though it's managed by a for-profit company. These funds are allocated by the Transportation Department to the company quarterly and through reimbursements. It may also lose out on ticket revenue because Washington DC is its second-biggest market.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-04/amtrak-at-risk-in-extended-u-s-shutdown.html\">Analysts told Bloomberg News</a> that Amtrak has enough money to last for the next few weeks, but after that period it's unclear whether the company would be able to function normally.</p><h2><strong>Public health</strong></h2><p>The National Institutes of Health is not accepting new patients for clinical trials, though those already enrolled in these programs will continue to receive care. An <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/shutdown-sequestration-cuts-zap-scientists-and-researchers/2013/10/02/bdfb0896-2ab6-11e3-b139-029811dbb57f_story.html\">NIH spokesman told the Washington Post</a> that the agency's closure could affect about 200 people who would normally be admitted for clinical trials, per week. A small group of NIH employees are monitoring experiments, since most were furloughed.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention furloughed workers that investigate disease outbreaks, and the annual influenza program, which tracks the disease and helps people get flu shots, was shut down.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419116647|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|769434cf2f2a9326029e49091adbb4ee74103fa4 -->",

He seemed irked that the US equity market, relying on a record of strong performance after previous shutdowns, had been positioning for a rally rather than collapsing in a way that would pressure his Republican opponents.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lewis adds later:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A key question is whether financial markets will go on believing in a twelfth-hour resolution of the fiscal conflict in Congress, or whether, at some point ahead of the debt ceiling deadline, they will start to take Mr Obama's warnings of impending chaos seriously. There can be no doubt that much might be at stake. The US Treasury is claiming that it could not prioritise federal debt service payments over other outlays, though that attitude may well be no more than part of the Administration's negotiating position. Servicing the debt as a priority certainly seems a more practical solution, if the Treasury really wanted to avoid default, than the more fanciful suggestions of invoking the Fourteenth Amendment or issuing a trillion-dollar coin. The truth seems to be that the US Treasury does not want to open up an avenue of escape from the impasse that would take pressure off the Republican leadership.</p> <p>The intransigence of the parties in this dispute, if it is maintained, could lead markets to begin to attach some weight to the possibility that a default might occur. After all, a default would have devastating consequences, foremost in the derivative and money markets but spreading to all global financial markets.</p> <p>The situation offers an interesting exercise in game theory.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T13:39:11.756+01:00\">at 1.39pm BST</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-524ea55ce4b0c4d027486a37\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T12:53:45.498+01:00\">12.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Looks like <strong>Wall Street</strong>&nbsp;may claw back some of yesterday's losses when trading starts in a little over 90 minutes time.</p> <p>The futures markets suggest the Dow Jones index will crawl higher by about 30 points, or 0.2%.</p> <p>Most European stock markets are now a little higher, as traders digest <a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/boehner-said-to-be-flexible-on-debt-ceiling-vote-2013-10-03?dist=beforebell%20%20\"><strong>those reports that House Speaker John Boehner is prepared, if needed, to work with Democrats to end the deadlock</strong></a> (by&nbsp;proposing budget legislation that doesn't have the support of a majority of House Republicans).</p> <p>As Brenda Kelly of IG puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The underlying sentiment seems to be marginally hopeful of a resolution from the US government.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-524ea3d4e4b0c4d027486a36\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-10-04T12:21:44.762+01:00\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-77990849-f4e2-4743-9d3e-73d008450ed9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380885613809/f719420f-5d76-47f6-bf14-e13eade055c7-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho (L) intervenes during the biweekly debate with his presence at the Parliament, accompanied by the Vice Prime Minister Paulo Portas (C) and by the Minister of Finance Maria Luis Albuquerque (R), in Lisbon, Portugal, 04 October 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho in parliament today.

        "body":"<p>Republicans will stage piecemeal budget votes over the weekend offering symbolic funding to additional public services, as Republicans and Democrats accused the other of deliberately dragging out the wider government shutdown into a second week.</p><p>The GOP-dominated House of Representatives will attempt to re-open the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and child nutrition and development programmes, as well as pledging to provide back pay for other furloughed federal workers.</p><p>Democrats are likely to reject the stopgap measures, however, which they regard as gimmicks aimed at shifting blame for the shutdown away from Republicans holding the president to ransom over his healthcare reforms.</p><p>Similar piecemeal votes affecting national parks and monuments, veterans services and the District of Columbia have already been blocked in the Senate, which is calling for a \"clean\" vote to continue all government funding.</p><p>As the two sides looked further apart than ever at the end of the first shutdown week, the debate shifted instead to allegations that both sides are seeking to prolong the stalemate for political advantage.</p><p>Republicans seized on <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303492504579113781436540284.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTTopStories\">off-the-record quotes in the Wall Street Journal</a> which appear to show the White House settling in for a long fight.</p><p>It claimed a senior administration official had said: \"We are winning … It doesn't really matter to us [how long the shutdown lasts] because what matters is the end result.\"</p><p>Though unclear whether such a remark really reflects the view of the Obama administration, the quote was jumped on by House speaker John Boehner in a press conference setting out Republican tactics.</p><p>\"This morning I get out the Wall Street Journal out and it says: 'We don't care how long it lasts because we [the Democrats] are winning',\" said Boehner. \"This isn't some damn game. All we are asking for is to sit down and have a discussion.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/386138683071401984\">White House spokesman Jay Carney dismissed the allegation</a> that it wanted a shutdown as \"absurd\" on Friday, repeating calls from Obama for the Republicans to allow a \"clean\" budget vote in the House that would probably see a majority voting to end the shutdown.</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/04/gop-hot-mic-were-gonna-win-this-with-spin/\">Democrats seized on a candid conversation between Republican senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul</a>, who were recorded discussing their tactics to keep blaming the shutdown on the president.</p><p>\"I don't think they poll-tested 'we won't negotiate',\" Paul told McConnell. \"I think it's awful for them to say that over and over. I know we don't want to be here but we are going to win this.\"</p><p>The continued war of words between both sides dashed overnight hopes that Republican leaders might be preparing a partial climbdown.</p><p>Boehner, in particular, rejected any notion that he had ruled out voting against an increase in the debt limit.</p><p>\"I don't believe we should default on our debt, but after 55 years of spending more than what you bring in, something ought to be addressed,\" he said. \"I think the American people expect that if we are going to raise the amount that we borrow, we ought to do something about our spending problem.\"</p><p>Optimism had previously grown that Republicans were tiring of the fight when Boehner was reported on Thursday to have told moderates in his own party that he would work with Democrats if necessary to avoid a debt limit breach and possibly even pass continuing spending resolution.</p><p><a href=\"ttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/shutdown-votes-for-a-clean-cr/chart/?sdw\">Unofficial Washington estimates suggest</a> around 25 moderate Republicans would back a vote on a \"clean\" funding resolution, which would be enough to pass if supported by Democrats, but this group still appears smaller and less determined than the hardline Tea Party supporters driving Boehner toward confrontation.</p><p>An eventual solution to the crisis is still likely to come in the form of a deal with Republican moderates, but all the time the party leadership believes it is at least persuading the American public to blame both sides for the shutdown they are likely to be encouraged to keep seeking concessions from Obama.</p><p>There are also signs that some Democrats are wavering in their support for the tough line adopted by Obama and Senate leader Harry Reid, as 57 House Democrats joined Republicans to vote for the piecemeal funding measures debated earlier this week.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419104123|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|d76f6e2544aa870173f34be187881a8e77b17097 -->",

        "body":"<p>The partial shutdown of the US government, which entered its fifth day on Saturday, is a \"momentary episode\" and does not change the US commitment to Asia or elsewhere, secretary of state John Kerry said. </p><p>Kerry is acting as stand-in for President Barack Obama, who canceled a tour of Asia, including a visit to the Indonesian resort island of Bali for a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders, because of the stalemate in Washington. </p><p>\"Do not mistake this momentary episode in American politics as anything more than a moment of politics. This is an example of the robustness of our democracy,\" Kerry said. But he added that if the shutdown were prolonged or repeated, people would question the US ability to \"stay the course\".<br /> <br />Kerry said that in his meetings with foreign leaders in Bali, he had encountered an understanding of the problems in Washington. </p><p>\"In the end nothing will change with respect to the issues that bring us here, nothing will diminish our commitment to Asia, we will continue to fulfill our responsibilities and our engagement around the world and I think people are confident of that,\" he said. \"Everybody in the region understands … everyone sees this as a moment in politics, an unfortunate moment, but they see it for what it is.\"<br /> <br />The political standoff over the US budget has shut down non-essential government services and appears likely to drag on for another week or more. Another crisis looms in two weeks, when lawmakers must decide whether to increase the US government's $16.7tn debt borrowing limit. </p><p>While Kerry dismissed any long-term impact from the shutdown, he said it would however delay payments for security assistance to Israel and funding support for a US-led peacekeeping mission in the Sinai peninsula, which divides Egypt and Israel. He said the US Treasury, which oversees sanctions against Iran, had been forced to furlough nearly all of its staff during the shutdown. This, he said, was coming at a time when the US was trying to re-engage with Tehran to find a solution to a longstanding dispute over Iran's nuclear weapons program. </p><p>\"I think it's clear we cannot lose this opportunity to moments of politics, that deprive us of the opportunity to embrace larger and more important goals,\" Kerry said, of potential talks with Iran. </p><p>Obama had planned to leave on Saturday for a four-nation, week-long trip. He canceled visits to Malaysia and the Philippines earlier this week and said late on Thursday he would not attend the regional summits in Indonesia and Brunei.  Kerry dismissed suggestions that US interests in the region were weakened by Obama's absence. </p><p>He said, however, that Obama's absence undermined the president's ability to have one-on-one conversations about global affairs with leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Two of Obama's main aims would have been to discuss the Syria crisis with Putin and to hold talks on a maritime code of conduct for disputed territories in the oil- and gas-rich South China Sea.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419138220|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|b612a13629923f3f6510276852fe37d40a6313a0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Pentagon is ordering most of its approximately 400,000 furloughed civilian employees back to work. The employees have been away from work as part of the ongoing government shutdown, which is the result of a standoff between Congress and the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/republicans-debt-limit-treasury-economy?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">over healthcare laws, government spending and the debt limit</a>.</p><p>The decision to order the furloughed workers back, which was made by the defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, is based on a Pentagon legal interpretation of a law called the Pay Our Military Act. That measure was passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama shortly before the partial government shutdown began Tuesday.</p><p>Earlier this week, the National Security Agency, which operates under the jurisdiction of the Defense Department, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/10/02/heres-the-letter-telling-nsa-staff-to-go-home-for-the-government-shutdown/\">furloughed an undisclosed number of employees</a>. The Pentagon did not immediately say on Saturday exactly how many workers would return to work, and in which areas. It said \"most\" employees were being brought back.</p><p>\"I expect us to be able to significantly reduce – but not eliminate – civilian furloughs under this process,\" Hagel said. \"Employees can expect to hear more information from their managers starting this weekend.\" </p><p>Hagel also cautioned that while he would be able to bring back civilians, the \"ay Our Military Act did not allow for the Defense Department to pay for some supplies necessary for many of them to do their jobs.</p><p>\"Critical parts, or supplies, will run out, and there will be limited authority for the department to purchase more,\" Hagel said. \"If there comes a time that workers are unable to do their work, I will be forced once again to send them home.\" </p><p>On Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/05/house-representatives-pass-bill-reimburse-furlough-workers\">the House of Representatives passed a bill to retroactively reimburse 800,000 furloughed federal workers</a> for pay lost in the government shutdown. The bill, which is supported by the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Obama White House, passed unanimously, 407-0.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419148534|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|322fc8e478a172d19573d6c51db8d227d083725b -->",

        "body":"<p>The Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, on Sunday accused Congress of \"playing with fire\" as the White House and Republicans remained entrenched over the government shutdown and the extension of the debt ceiling.</p><p>Appearing on CNN's State of the Union during a tour of the Sunday talk shows, Lew said there was no option that would prevent the government from defaulting on its bills <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/republicans-debt-limit-treasury-economy\">should lawmakers refuse to vote to raise the debt ceiling before the 17 October deadline</a>. Senior Republicans, however, lined up to insist in response that they would not compromise in their attempt to dismantle or defund Obamacare, the president's signature healthcare reform.</p><p>\"There is no option that prevents us from being in default if we don't have enough cash to pay our bills,\" Lew said. Asked if President Barack Obama could bypass Congress and use other measures to raise the debt ceiling and avoid defaulting, Lew said the only available solution was through Congress.</p><p>\"The White House has spoken quite clearly to this,\" Lew said. \"The president does not have the authority to take action in that kind of a way. The president consulted with his lawyers, and that's the conclusion that he's reached.\"</p><p>The government will reach its borrowing limit on 17 October, Lew said. \"I'm telling you that on the 17th, we run out of our ability to borrow, and Congress is playing with fire.\"</p><p>Lew repeatedly said that \"50 to 100\" members of Congress\" stood in the way of a resolution to the crisis which has now shut down the federal government for five days. Such politicians, he said, referring to right-wing Republicans, had \"changed the rules of the game\".</p><p>Lew was scheduled to appear on five Sunday news shows as the Obama administration sought to force Congress to take action. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/ted-cruz-texas-maverick\">Texas senator Ted Cruz</a>, one of the most outspoken voices against Obamacare, was among the Republicans who appeared to answer him. Cruz told CNN that Republicans should seek three things in exchange for passing a debt ceiling deal.</p><p>\"We should look for some significant structural plan to reduce government spending,\" he said. \"Number two, we should avoid new taxes. And number three we should look for ways to mitigate the harms from Obamacare.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/04/americans-blame-republicans-government-shutdown\">Recent polls have shown that more people blame Republicans than blame Obama for the shutdown</a>. In a signal of the toxicity of the shutdown as a political issue, the Republican candidate for the governorship of Virginia, Ken Cuccinelli,<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/cuccinelli-shuns-cruz-limelight-97888.html?hp=t1\"> reportedly went to great lengths to avoid being seen with Cruz</a> when they both spoke at a gala in Richmond, Virginia, on Saturday night. </p><p>Cruz praised Cuccinelli as \"principled and fearless\" during his speech at Richmond convention centre. Cuccinelli did not mention Cruz during his remarks and avoided being photographed with the Tea Party favourite.</p><p>Asked by CNN's Candy Crowley if he thought he had \"damaged the Republican party brand\" – in light of reports of division over Cruz's actions, which have included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/ted-cruz-speech-fault-lines-republicans\">a 21-hour Senate speech in a fruitless attempt to stop the passage of a budget bill without any provisions to defund Obamacare</a>, Cruz said: \"Not remotely.\"</p><p>The House speaker, John Boehner, has been criticised by some as being held hostage by a relatively small group of Tea Party-backed Republican members of Congress. Some have speculated that there are enough votes in Congress between Democrats and moderate Republicans to pass a \"clean bill\" – one without stipulations on dismantling Obamacare – <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/06/john-boehner-continuing-resolution_n_4053175.html\">if Boehner would bring it to the floor</a>. Lew repeated this idea on CNN and on NBC's Meet the Press.</p><p>On Sunday, however, Boehner attempted to shift the blame, insisting there were not enough votes in the House. Speaking on ABC's This Week, he said: \"There are not votes in the House to pass a clean CR.\" Boehner added that the House would not pass a bill raising the debt ceiling without a provision related to Obamacare.</p><p>\"We are not going to pass a clean debt limit [bill],\" Boehner said. \"The votes are not in the House … We are not going down that path.\"</p><p>The Kentucky senator Rand Paul, appearing on Meet the Press, completed the Republicans' united front. \"We've been putting out clean CRs all week,\" he said, referring to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/republicans-piecemeal-budget-votes-democrats\">the piecemeal legislation House Republicans have put forward to fund individual strands of government</a>, which on Saturday included a bill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/05/house-representatives-pass-bill-reimburse-furlough-workers\">to assure furloughed federal employees of the reimbursement of lost pay</a>.</p><p>Paul said no one was \"winning\" from the shutdown and said House members had been \"wanting to fund government\" – apart from Obamacare. Asked why Republicans in the Congress had shut down the government over a bill that had passed both Houses, been signed into law by the president and then been upheld by the supreme court, Paul said it was \"Congress's job to oversee spending\".</p><p>\"It's not their obligation once something is law to never change it,\" he said. \"It's a silly argument for Democrats to say: 'Oh the law's been passed, we can never change it.'\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419187550|2013-10-07T10:21:28Z|f7533cf681a6e81fd2f156b28fd3d718c8d12104 -->",
