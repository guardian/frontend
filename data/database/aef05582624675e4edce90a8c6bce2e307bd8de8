        "trailText":"Director Danny Boyle reveals plans for London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, including village cricket, maypoles and rain<br />",
        "headline":"Olympic opening ceremony will recreate countryside with real animals",
        "body":"<p>A village cricket team, 12 horses, 10 chickens, 70 sheep, a model of Glastonbury Tor, two mosh pits, and the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world are among the sights that will greet the world when the curtain comes up on the London Olympics, it has been revealed.</p><p>The surreal vista of a \"green and pleasant land\", with giant maypoles representing the symbols of the four nations of the UK around which children will dance, is the scene for the opening sequence of Danny Boyle's £27m opening ceremony extravaganza.</p><p>The director has ignored the age-old maxim about never working with children or animals. The opening scene features real grass, real ploughs, real soil and – said Boyle – real clouds that would supply \"rain\" if there was none in order to ensure an authentically British atmosphere. With no Glastonbury festival this year, the event will be evoked with a replica of Glastonbury Tor and mosh pits at either end of the arena.</p><p>One of those pits will have a Last Night of the Proms theme and the other a festival atmosphere, with around 100 young people in each.</p><p>While the show will open with a rural pastoral vision that evokes William Blake and Jerusalem, it is expected to evolve to take on a more urban hue. Boyle said he would not reveal how the \"puzzle fits together\" and he refused to confirm any of the acts taking part, although Sir Paul McCartney has already confirmed his involvement and the likes of Take That and The Who are also expected to feature.</p><p>But the director underlined that it was not a musical show, but a narrative set to music. The electronic group Underworld have already recorded two lengthy tracks at Abbey Road to score the action. The closing ceremony will be a more traditional celebration of British music.</p><p>Boyle had already revealed that the three-hour opening ceremony would be titled Isles of Wonder, a title based on a speech by Caliban in Shakespeare's The Tempest that will be referenced throughout the four ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Stephen Daldry, the Billy Elliot director who is overseeing all four ceremonies, said the ceremony was Boyle's \"singular vision\" rather than being developed by committee. In all, the ceremonies will cost £81m – a figure that doubled from the original budget.</p><p>If the jubilee weekend was a festival of pageantry and heritage, it already appears that Boyle's opening ceremony will be a more playful and anarchic treatment of British culture.</p><p>\"You're bound to fail, that's built in. But you hope that on the journey, you hope people will find enough in it to feel that it is representative of us,\" said Boyle.</p><p>He said there would be British humour and that the country's history would be represented but \"not in a box-ticking way\", and the show would reflect \"parts of our heritage but looking forward as well\".</p><p>A troupe of NHS nurses will appear in one sequence, but Boyle said the show would not be overtly political.</p><p>\"This is a festival of celebration of an Olympic ideal. But it's not a naive show. We're trying to show the best of us, but we're also trying to show many different things about our country. The growth of cities is an extraordinary phenomenon that is clearly linked to the growth of the Olympic Games.\"</p><p>The cast and crew, which will number 10,000 once volunteers are taken into account, have one more weekend of rehearsals in Dagenham before moving into the stadium – where the replica of Glastonbury Tor and the giant bell are already in position. There have already been 157 rehearsals.</p><p>The BBC confirmed that it would supply two short films to the opening ceremony and Boyle said it would differ from previous Games in being more cinematic in tone, rather than relying on scale alone.</p><p>\"We're trying to make you feel like you're watching a live film being made,\" said the Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting director. \"It feels like when you're planning a big sequence in a film. We're trying to make it feel like a live recording of a film that all happens on one evening. We're trying to shoot it in a very visceral way.</p><p>One of the major challenges will be keeping the athletes, who will parade around a circuit designed to evoke the M25 or London's north circular road, moving.</p><p>\"There is an hour of culture, then there is the parade of athletes and the lighting of the cauldron and the fireworks. In between that, there is the protocol – the speeches and the raising of the flags. All of that is preceded by the arrival of the head of state,\"</p><p>Boyle said the giant bell, hanging at one end of the stadium, sounded \"absolutely amazing\". It will ring to begin the show.</p><p>\"You will feel different when you're in there and you hear it ring. When you hear it it's very sweet. It's ancient, so it reminds you of the past. It's also timeless, so it evokes the future. That was how communities notified each other something important was about to happen,\" he said.</p><p>Boyle also teased that there would be \"real clouds\" over the stadium.</p><p>\"They will be real clouds that will be hanging over the stadium. Work that out if you can. We know we're an island culture and an island climate. One of these clouds will provide rain on the evening, just in case it doesn't rain.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391466427|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|365459a6be06985de82dec624b3358b3175dfa41 -->",

        "headline":"Teófilo Stevenson obituary",
        "body":"<p>Boxing holds a special place in the hearts of Cubans, and after Fidel Castro banned professional sports in the early 1960s, the country quickly became a dominant power in the amateur rings. Their biggest star was the heavyweight Teófilo Stevenson, who has died after suffering from heart disease aged 60. Stevenson was the second boxer, after the Hungarian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/oct/18/guardianobituaries.boxing\" title=\"\">László Papp</a>, and the first heavyweight, to become a three-time Olympic gold medallist. (His fellow Cuban heavyweight Félix Savón has since accomplished the same feat.)</p><p>Stevenson famously turned down a potential million-dollar payday for a fight against Muhammad Ali, which would have been billed as an epic confrontation between American democracy and Soviet-style communism. \"What is a million dollars,\" asked Stevenson, \"compared to the love of eight million Cubans?\" The match would have been intriguing; tall, handsome and formidable, with a seemingly unmarked face, Stevenson was the amateur Ali. But he was rarely tested by the three-round amateur bouts.</p><p>I was at the Montreal Forum in 1976 when Stevenson won his second Olympic gold medal. His opponent, the Romanian Mircea Simon, was respectful of Stevenson's dominance and edged warily around the ring for two rounds, landing the occasional long-range jab, to the delight of his corner. In the third and final round, he tried to land a punch. Stevenson deployed a powerful right-handed counter, and SSimon's corner threw the towel into the ring immediately.</p><p>Stevenson was born in Cuba's eastern Las Tunas province. His father was an immigrant from Saint Vincent; his mother was a first-generation Cuban whose parents had come from Saint Kitts. Big for his age, and otherwise seemingly unfocused, he began sparring seriously at nine and by his early teens, coached by John Herrera, had won his first junior title.</p><p>Soon he was training in Havana under the Soviet coach Andrei Chervonenko, who began teaching him the style perfected in eastern Europe to take advantage of amateur scoring, which counted all punches landed equally. Combined with the more professional style he had already learned, Stevenson quickly established himself. He lost in the national finals at 17 and won bronze at the Pan American Games in 1971, after losing to the highly touted American Duane Bobick.</p><p>At the 1972 Munich Olympics, Stevenson and Bobick met in the quarter-finals, in what was probably the greatest fight of Stevenson's career. The fight went into the decisive third round, and he won after putting Bobick down three times. Stevenson then easily won his semi-final, and he took the gold when Romania's Ion Alexe withdrew due to injury. This began Stevenson's unprecedented run of domination in the amateur ranks. He won the 1974 World Championships before a wildly partisan crowd in Havana and the 1975 Pan American Games in Mexico City before his Olympic victory in Montreal. These were heady times for Cuban sport –  Stevenson and the athlete Alberto  Juantorena were arguably the biggest stars of the 1976 Olympics.</p><p>Stevenson's only losses during this time came in dual meets with the Soviets, in 1973 and 1976, to <a href=\"http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=9323&amp;more=1\" title=\"\">Igor Vysotsky</a>, but he won further World, Pan American and Olympic titles, the latter achieved in Moscow in 1980. His streak ended at the 1982 World Championships, with a loss to Italy's Francesco Damiani, but he would likely have won a fourth Olympic gold had Cuba not boycotted the 1984 Games in Los Angeles; Stevenson had beaten Tyrell Biggs, who won the Olympic gold, in a Cuba-US dual meet before the Games.</p><p>Stevenson won the 1986 World title at super-heavyweight, but retired in 1988 after another Cuban boycott – this time of the Seoul Olympics – cost him another chance for a fourth gold. He ended his career with 302 wins and only 22 losses. Stevenson then lived in relative luxury in Havana. He became a coach with the national team, and rose to the vice-presidency of the national boxing federation. It was while travelling with the national team from a match against the US in 1999 that he was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/24/sports/plus-boxing-stevenson-of-cuba-arrested-in-miami.html\" title=\"\">arrested at Miami airport</a>, accused of headbutting an airline employee. Released on bail, he returned to Havana, and never faced trial, but said that he had been provoked by Cuban exiles in Miami, because he was an internationally successful Cuban sports figure.</p><p>In January this year, Stevenson was hospitalised with a blood clot. He was gladdened by the outpouring of support he received from around the globe – \"even from Miami,\" he said.</p><p>He is survived by two children.</p><p><em> </em>• Teófilo Stevenson, boxer, born 29 March 1952; died 11 June 2012</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391484336|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|c9e0cb3de800e7ccaa779a215fc8722b16ea48c0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Scottish fencer Keith Cook appealed on Monday against his exclusion from the squad for London 2012 – claiming British Fencing had failed to follow their written Olympic selection policy and procedures.</p><p>Cook, the 2010 British champion and five-times Commonwealth Games medallist, was not named in the seven-strong group for the individual events, with five of the team chosen on a discretionary basis under the Host Nation places rules.</p><p>It is understood he has also missed out on the team event squad, who are set to be announced on Tuesday morning.</p><p>The 31-year-old, who opted out of British Fencing's \"Olympic Pathway\" two years ago for family reasons, was told in correspondence from British Fencing officials that while he was included in general discussions for selection, because the performance manager Alex Newton had not been given contact details as set out in Section&nbsp;13 of the selection policy document, he was not informed that he had not been selected and the deadline for any appeal had passed.</p><p>The chief executive, Piers Martin, explained in an email to Cook that because the Section&nbsp;13 information was not received British Fencing \"did not consider that you wanted to be considered for selection\".</p><p>Cook, ranked 95 in the world and still in the British top six having battled against recent injury, believes proper procedure was not followed.</p><p>\"I saw all these things going on in the press with people lodging appeals and I am like 'how do they know they have not been selected? What have I missed here?' Cook said. \"It was getting closer to the Olympics and I was thinking 'this is not right'.</p><p>\"I emailed the performance manager and asked to be let known what was going on because I had not received any information. I got one back saying it was to do with not giving your email address and phone number – and I said 'you must be joking'.</p><p>\"I have had constant emails, text messages and phone calls from the performance manager, I was part of the team who have been there for six years. They have got my phone number. I said 'no way are you going to do it on a technicality like that'.</p><p>\"Basically they have broken their own process. The process is that everybody is supposed to have the emails about rankings and also they are supposed to say 'have you got anything else you want to add to your case for Olympic selection?'</p><p>\"I can't argue about who they have picked because it is discretionary places, but they did not give me a chance and did not follow the process of Olympic selection.\"</p><p>British Fencing maintains its selection process is transparent and robust. The communications director, David King, said in a statement: \"British Fencing strongly denies any bias or inappropriate action in the non-selection of Keith Cook for a discretionary Home Nation place at the London 2012 Olympics.</p><p>\"British Fencing has fully supported Mr Cook in his Olympic ambitions, selecting him for every international competition where he met the qualifying standard and choosing him to participate in the Olympic test event in November.</p><p>\"Like the other 25 athletes in contention for an Olympic spot, Mr Cook would have been fully aware of what was required to achieve consideration.</p><p>\"At the time of selection Mr Cook was in 19th position across all athletes and weapons for eight host nation places. He was the sixth highest-rated men's foilist with a world ranking of 94.</p><p>\"We certainly understand the disappointment that any athlete feels when devoting one's life to training and working to achieve a goal like this and coming short.</p><p>\"While we regret that Mr Cook has felt it necessary to make these statements, British Fencing will continue to support Mr Cook's future ambitions.\"</p><p>There was some controversy surrounding the individual squad announcement at the start of June, with only two of the seven fencers having qualified by right.</p><p>King, though, added: \"We have made what we think are the best decisions, both for 2012 and 2016. We have a good squad and it is time for everyone to get behind them and let's go forward.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391450755|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|0e9c0b766a79ba502a3ecc7ec29aed79f54cc9b0 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Queen's presence at the opening ceremony will not be the only royal appearance at this summer's Olympics, after Zara Phillips won her battle to appear at London 2012 as part of the British equestrian team.</p><p>British Olympic Association officials have confirmed that the Queen's granddaughter would compete in Greenwich Park this summer, following in the footsteps of her mother and father.</p><p>Her hopes had hung in the balance since the retirement last year of her longstanding mount Toytown, but she is believed to have been chosen for one of five places in the British eventing team riding High Kingdom. The other members of the team are expected to be William Fox-Pitt, Mary King, Tina Cook and Piggy French, who won last year's test event in Greenwich.</p><p>Phillips' chances of making the Games had been virtually written off following the retirement of Toytown last year, but she boosted her selection chances when she came third at Bramham Horse Trials on High Kingdom.</p><p>Phillips won the 2006 world championships on Toytown, and was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year the following December. However, injuries to the horse in 2004 and 2008 meant that she never competed in an Olympic Games.</p><p>The news will doubtless please many of those with tickets to watch the eventing in Greenwich Park, as well as Olympic sponsor Samsung. Along with David Beckham, who is expected to make the Team GB football squad, she acts as an ambassador for the electronics brand.</p><p>Her new mount, which she has ridden sporadically throughout her career, is not considered to be in the same class as Toytown. But after finishing third at Bramham, she spoke of High Kingdom's rapid improvement and that, combined with her experience as a rider in major competitions, is likely to have tipped the balance in her favour.</p><p>Phillips, who is married to former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, said: \"It's awesome to be given this opportunity.</p><p>\"I am really excited and can't wait to kick on and get him there. Hopefully, we will make it this time.\"</p><p>Phillips's mother, Princess Anne, competed in the 1976 Olympic Games as a member of the British team in Montreal on the Queen's horse Goodwill. As a representative on the International Olympic Committee, she was a vocal advocate of the campaign to bring the Games to London. Phillips's father, Captain Mark Phillips, won a gold medal in 1972 and a silver in 1988.</p><p>A BOA spokesman said: \"I can't comment on who has been selected until the team has been officially announced later this week.\"</p><p>Phillips will take one of five slots on the eventing team in a sport expected to deliver medals for Team GB.</p><p>Part of the rationale for holding the equestrian events in central London in Greenwich Park as opposed to a venue further from the athletes' village is to appeal to spectators and TV viewers who have not considered watching it before.</p><p>The presence of the 13th in line to the throne in eventing competition is only likely to add to the interest and anticipation around an event that was among the first to sell out when tickets went on sale last year.</p><p>• This article was amended on 12 June 2012 to make clear that it was Zara Phillips's father, not Princess Anne's, who won Olympic medals in 1972 and 1988.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391447200|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|4c1ea8ff00cd531aabf853bbec6f2de04446b976 -->",

        "headline":"The Olympics are exposing Britain as a self-obsessed nation",
        "body":"<p>Patriotism becomes daft when you expect other countries to share your national pride. America nearly got away with it in the age of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/moonlandings/\" title=\"\">moon landings</a>, when children of my generation accepted it as fair enough for the stars and stripes to hang out there in space. But it has been <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ccmphtml/colaadv.html\" title=\"\">a long time since even the land of Coke could teach the world to sing</a>. Why should the entire world be expected to embrace the British self-love that appears to be at the heart of the Olympics opening ceremony? Are we offering ourselves as the new America, a land so marvellous it can export its self-image?</p><p>A billion people around the planet are expected to witness the £27m ceremony conceived by film director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle</a> to start the Games. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">In details announced today</a>, it emerges that he will turn the stadium into a vast model of an ideal and somewhat mythic British countryside. Complete with landmarks like Glastonbury Tor and entitled Green and Pleasant, the spectacle will treat the world to a romantic vision of our national landscape. Real farmyard animals will be grazing; in total there will be 70 sheep, 12 horses, three cows, two goats, 10 chickens, 10 ducks, nine geese and three sheepdogs. There will also be clouds with fake rain in case the night is clear. \"If it doesn't rain, we have created our own,\" said Boyle at the announcement, pointing to four huge clouds hanging from wires over a model of the stadium.</p><p>Look, I am not a huge athletics fan. Sometimes I watch the Olympics on TV, sometimes I don't. Is it the done thing to obsess about one's own national identity quite so overtly in the opening ceremony? By the sound of it, though, Boyle's spectacle will be far from complacent: with references to the aftermath of the industrial revolution and a cast that includes NHS nurses, it does sound as though he is offering an alternative, radical style of patriotism, not to mention laughing at national traits and the soggy climate. But radical navel-gazing is navel-gazing nonetheless.</p><p>There seems to be a unfortunate blur between this summer's jubilee and the Olympics. It is a culmination of a boom in self-regard that has made modern Britain ever more inward-looking. Waving flags for the jubilee was logical: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2154671/Queens-Diamond-Jubilee-Crowd-500-000-flag-waving-royalists-cheered-sang-danced-night-Britain-showed-world-party.html\" title=\"\">the Queen is nothing if not British</a>. But the Olympics? Surely, the Games are international.</p><p>The British Museum in London currently has <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2012/winning_at_the_ancient_games.aspx\" title=\"\">a modest display of 12 objects recalling the ancient Greek Olympics</a>. The highlight – which no one who visits London this summer should miss – is the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/laurendill/422021748/\" title=\"\">Motya Charioteer</a>, one of the masterpieces of ancient Greek art. Contemplating this sensuous statue of an athlete in a clinging robe, I could not help wishing the British Museum would put on a full-scale show about the history of the Olympics to celebrate us hosting the world's greatest sporting event. Instead, its big exhibition for the Olympic summer, in the same flag-waving mood as Boyle's sceptred-isle landscape, will be about <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/shakespeare_staging_the_world.aspx\" title=\"\">Shakespeare</a>. I am looking forward to it. But then I am British.</p><p>Is Britain playing host to the world this summer – or to itself? Why on Earth is the romantic Little England of Boyle's opener the appropriate way to begin a festival celebrating the human planet?</p><p>There's something very 1930s about all this. When we remember the Depression, we see the vicious hyper-nationalism of Hitler and Mussolini as nightmares never to be repeated – yet democratic countries too became inward-looking and self-obsessed in that age of austerity. <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/john-piper-1774\" title=\"\">British artists harped on about the landscape</a>. <a href=\"http://www.pgwodehousesociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Novelists feasted on British eccentricity</a>. Now, in this new age of austerity, imaginations are once more preoccupied with homegrown qualities and known landscapes. Isn't the Olympics meant to be bigger and more generous than that?</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391483299|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|64e2d4c74a4061e6c87bd7d7c08b2b3afdf80a6b -->",

        "headline":"London 2012 opening ceremony promises spectacle and surprises",
        "body":"<p>What is an Olympic opening ceremony? Something between a pageant, a procession, a theatre show, a concert and a film. It contains diplomacy, politics, flag-waving (literally), sport and art. None of these are easy bedfellows, but one feels that in Danny Boyle's confident hands, the London Games curtain-raiser has a strong chance of melding those disparate elements into something intimate as well as spectacular, edgy as well as celebratory, funny as well as grand. It may even be moving.</p><p>If the bucolic vision of rolling hills, a cricket match, 70 sheep, horses, ducks, cows and actual ploughing that Boyle has unveiled seems a little English and pastoral, rather than British and urban, I predict that surprises will be in store. From this opening scene – intended to invoke a &quot;mythic landscape&quot;, presumably on to which the actor Mark Rylance will appear to proclaim that &quot;the isle is full of noises&quot; – a &quot;thematic narrative&quot; will evolve, Boyle said, devised with the writer Frank Cottrell Boyce. According to the ceremonies' executive producer, Stephen Daldry, the narrative will invoke &quot;who we were, who we are and what we will be&quot;. Both Boyle and Daldry used the word visceral.</p><p>The terrifying splendour of the Beijing opening ceremony, with its massed ranks of highly disciplined participants, still looms large in the memory. Reading between the lines of Boyle's cryptic remarks (not unreasonably, he wants the detail of the event to unfold &quot;like a puzzle&quot; on the day), the British event will be small as well as big; invoke the individual as well as the collective; and have a touch of anarchy amid the tightly controlled choreography. He described the ceremony as like a film that will be shot live – crucially, using not only wide angles but also close-ups.</p><p>There may be tremendous spectacle and glamour (clouds emitting rain on demand in the event that nature fails to provide; exciting aerial work from the wire strung across the stadium), but I suspect that some moments will zero in on lone figures. At the same time, Boyle is keen to make the event feel communal and inclusive, hence the two audience-filled pits beneath the twin stages, which have been dubbed the moshpit and the posh pit: one is intended to recall the audience at Glastonbury; the other reflects the other the crowd at the Last Night of the Proms. Boyle said these people would be drawn into the action of the event: &quot;You will feel very involved.&quot;</p><p>The key to the success or failure of the ceremony is whether Boyle's integrity of vision has been allowed to remain unsullied or turns out to have been diluted by the dead hand of the committee. Boyle spoke of the many representations he had had, not just from officials but from strangers grabbing him on the tube to pass on their ideas. He had been doing a lot of listening, he said, but also noted that whatever he did he was bound to fail, to an extent: there was no way that everyone's idea of Britain could be realised.</p><p>With luck, Boyle will have clung on to the spikiness and wit that characterises his work, alongside his gift for the spectacular visual moments that were a such an enjoyable feature of Slumdog Millionaire. He admitted that some aspects of British humour might be lost on overseas viewers, but said: &quot;I hope it will reveal how peculiar and contrary we are – and how there's also, I hope, a warmth about us.&quot; If he manages that, he will have pulled off the job.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391485732|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|8f62166c1cb6b4013cfb12aab35616262e854826 -->",

        "body":"<p>Danny Boyle has revealed his vision for the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, and it sounds both ambitious and surreal. Starting with a pastoral \"green and pleasant land\" featuring a village cricket team alongside a working farm and rural vistas, the extravaganza is expected to develop into a more urban vision, reflecting the development of the nation. </p><p>Boyle, whose vision is inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest, impishly claims the ceremony will also feature real clouds that would supply \"rain\" if there was none in order to ensure a traditionally British atmosphere. A replica of Glastonbury Tor stands at one end of the arena, with \"mosh pits\" at either end of the arena, one reflecting a festival crowd, the other said to invoke the atmosphere of Last Night of the Proms.</p><p>We are curious to see how this will all end up. Will the ceremony be a witty and impressively epic paen to Britishness, or a mind-boggling post-modern mess?</p><p>This is where you come in. We're fascinated to see how this ends up looking, and we want to see your creative interpretations of the show. So we're setting up a special edition of The Gallery - here, as an example, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/gallery/2012/jun/05/euro-2012-predictions-the-gallery\">what our readers predicted for Euro 2012</a>. <strong>Email your photoshopped masterpieces to gallery@guardian.co.uk by midday on Wednesday 13 June</strong>, complete with a caption.

        "headline":"Olympic opening ceremony will recreate countryside with real animals",
        "body":"<p>A village cricket team, 12 horses, 10 chickens, 70 sheep, a model of Glastonbury Tor, two mosh pits, and the largest harmonically tuned bell in the world are among the sights that will greet the world when the curtain comes up on the London Olympics, it has been revealed.</p><p>The surreal vista of a \"green and pleasant land\", with giant maypoles representing the symbols of the four nations of the UK around which children will dance, is the scene for the opening sequence of Danny Boyle's £27m opening ceremony extravaganza.</p><p>The director has ignored the age-old maxim about never working with children or animals. The opening scene features real grass, real ploughs, real soil and – said Boyle – real clouds that would supply \"rain\" if there was none in order to ensure an authentically British atmosphere. With no Glastonbury festival this year, the event will be evoked with a replica of Glastonbury Tor and mosh pits at either end of the arena.</p><p>One of those pits will have a Last Night of the Proms theme and the other a festival atmosphere, with around 100 young people in each.</p><p>While the show will open with a rural pastoral vision that evokes William Blake and Jerusalem, it is expected to evolve to take on a more urban hue. Boyle said he would not reveal how the \"puzzle fits together\" and he refused to confirm any of the acts taking part, although Sir Paul McCartney has already confirmed his involvement and the likes of Take That and The Who are also expected to feature.</p><p>But the director underlined that it was not a musical show, but a narrative set to music. The electronic group Underworld have already recorded two lengthy tracks at Abbey Road to score the action. The closing ceremony will be a more traditional celebration of British music.</p><p>Boyle had already revealed that the three-hour opening ceremony would be titled Isles of Wonder, a title based on a speech by Caliban in Shakespeare's The Tempest that will be referenced throughout the four ceremonies of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p><p>Stephen Daldry, the Billy Elliot director who is overseeing all four ceremonies, said the ceremony was Boyle's \"singular vision\" rather than being developed by committee. In all, the ceremonies will cost £81m – a figure that doubled from the original budget.</p><p>If the jubilee weekend was a festival of pageantry and heritage, it already appears that Boyle's opening ceremony will be a more playful and anarchic treatment of British culture.</p><p>\"You're bound to fail, that's built in. But you hope that on the journey, you hope people will find enough in it to feel that it is representative of us,\" said Boyle.</p><p>He said there would be British humour and that the country's history would be represented but \"not in a box-ticking way\", and the show would reflect \"parts of our heritage but looking forward as well\".</p><p>A troupe of NHS nurses will appear in one sequence, but Boyle said the show would not be overtly political.</p><p>\"This is a festival of celebration of an Olympic ideal. But it's not a naive show. We're trying to show the best of us, but we're also trying to show many different things about our country. The growth of cities is an extraordinary phenomenon that is clearly linked to the growth of the Olympic Games.\"</p><p>The cast and crew, which will number 10,000 once volunteers are taken into account, have one more weekend of rehearsals in Dagenham before moving into the stadium – where the replica of Glastonbury Tor and the giant bell are already in position. There have already been 157 rehearsals.</p><p>The BBC confirmed that it would supply two short films to the opening ceremony and Boyle said it would differ from previous Games in being more cinematic in tone, rather than relying on scale alone.</p><p>\"We're trying to make you feel like you're watching a live film being made,\" said the Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting director. \"It feels like when you're planning a big sequence in a film. We're trying to make it feel like a live recording of a film that all happens on one evening. We're trying to shoot it in a very visceral way.</p><p>One of the major challenges will be keeping the athletes, who will parade around a circuit designed to evoke the M25 or London's north circular road, moving.</p><p>\"There is an hour of culture, then there is the parade of athletes and the lighting of the cauldron and the fireworks. In between that, there is the protocol – the speeches and the raising of the flags. All of that is preceded by the arrival of the head of state,\"</p><p>Boyle said the giant bell, hanging at one end of the stadium, sounded \"absolutely amazing\". It will ring to begin the show.</p><p>\"You will feel different when you're in there and you hear it ring. When you hear it it's very sweet. It's ancient, so it reminds you of the past. It's also timeless, so it evokes the future. That was how communities notified each other something important was about to happen,\" he said.</p><p>Boyle also teased that there would be \"real clouds\" over the stadium.</p><p>\"They will be real clouds that will be hanging over the stadium. Work that out if you can. We know we're an island culture and an island climate. One of these clouds will provide rain on the evening, just in case it doesn't rain.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391466427|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|365459a6be06985de82dec624b3358b3175dfa41 -->",

        "body":"<p>Tessa Jowell, the shadow minister for the Olympics, has urged the government to learn the lessons of the construction of the Olympic Park, claiming its successful completion should form the blueprint for a new model of public-private partnership.</p><p>Jowell, who was instrumental in bringing the Games to London in 2005 and sits on the London 2012 board, said she believed that the commitment to national benefit that underpinned the programme had created a higher sense of purpose that brought the best out of its employees.</p><p>The Olympic Delivery Authority was criticised by some for not doing more to employ local people, but Jowell said its commitment to investment in training had proved that major public infrastructure projects delivered by the private sector could also have social benefits.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/13/london-2012-olympics-under-budget\" title=\"\">government said this week that the Games were likely to come in more than £400m under budget</a>, although the public funding package of £9.3bn was more than three times the initial bid projection of £2.4bn.</p><p>\"The story of the Olympic construction is a success story for British business. A project twice the size of Heathrow's Terminal 5 was built in half the time and half a billion pounds under budget,\" said Jowell in a speech to the Euroconstruct industry conference.</p><p>\"It was also a success story in terms of the benefit that it brought to the nation. Seventy-five pence in every pound was spent on regeneration. Efforts were made to invest in individuals, with 3,500 training opportunities offered on site, 457 apprenticeships on offer and 11% of the jobs going to the formerly unemployed.\"</p><p>Jowell said the successful construction project, which has helped banish the ghosts of Wembley and the aborted attempt to build a stadium for the world athletics championships at Picketts Lock, held a number of lessons for future major public projects.</p><p>\"The first lesson is that a public-private partnership should seek to create a higher purpose than the bottom line. During the Olympic construction project, this allowed the management to create an ethos that went beyond the simple objectives of the construction project. The focus on regeneration and local benefit not only built better relationships with local residents, but it also created a supportive culture within the workforce that 'failure was not an option' and that everything had to be done to make the project a success,\" she said.</p><p>\"The second lesson is that the employer and trade unions need to be engaged in co-operation rather than confrontation. Over the course of the Olympic project, both sides agreed to work together in their common interests rather than lose together through entering into conflict.\"</p><p>She claimed that through investing in training and skills of those on site, the overall number of contractors required had been reduced by around 6,000 and hundreds of millions of pounds had been saved.</p><p>\"My hope is that we can learn from the experience of the Games and take a new approach to public-private working in the future. My colleagues Ed Miliband and Chuka Umunna have rightly made the case for making specified numbers of apprenticeships a pre-condition for receiving public sector contracts,\" said Jowell.</p><p>\"My hope is that we can go further, and use the experience of the Games to provide a blueprint for making public money work harder in the public interest.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391674060|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|d2f4d6020cabbc11df816a5fe7207f447516e916 -->",

        "body":"<p>The International Olympic Committee has launched an inquiry into allegations that Olympic officials and agents have been caught selling tickets for the London 2012 Games on the black market.</p><p>The IOC has held an emergency meeting of its ruling executive following an undercover newspaper investigation. It has referred the allegations to its independent ethics commission, which could lead to a review of how Olympic tickets are distributed among member countries in the future.</p><p><em>Sunday Times </em>reporters posing as envoys of a Middle Eastern ticket tout claim to have found 27 officials and agents representing 54 countries who were willing to breach the rules on selling tickets. One, from Serbia, offered 1,500 tickets for £80,000, while China's official ticket agency agreed to sell the best seats in the stadiums for up to £6,000 each, according to the newspaper. It also alleges that Spyros Capralos, the president of Greece's Olympic committee, breached regulations.</p><p>The IOC said it has moved \"quickly\" to deal with the allegations. \"After claims that several NOCs [National Olympic Committees] and ATRs [authorised ticket resellers] were reportedly willing to break the rules by offering to buy or sell tickets outside their territory, sell tickets at inflated prices, or sell tickets to unauthorised resellers, the IOC has ordered an immediate inquiry and referred the allegations to its independent ethics commission,\" it said.</p><p>\"The IOC takes these allegations very seriously and has immediately taken the first steps to investigate. Should any irregularities be proven, the organisation will deal with those involved in an appropriate manner. The NOCs are autonomous organisations, but if any of the cases are confirmed the IOC will not hesitate to impose the strongest sanctions.\"</p><p>The IOC said it will take on board any recommendations from the inquiry to improve the way tickets are allocated and sold internationally.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/391744639|2013-10-02T14:49:17Z|395c8cc3d56bf13e95b1c73f9b77b627642dcf2a -->",
