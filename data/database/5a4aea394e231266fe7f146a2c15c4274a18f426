So when the female jaguar finally emerged from the undergrowth and walked down to the river to drink, McDonald was grateful for the photo opportunity. But that was just a start. After slaking her thirst the female flopped down on the sand. Then the male appeared. After drinking and scent-marking he approached the female, who was lying in what appeared to be a pose of enticement. At least that’s what both McDonald and the male thought. She rose, growled and suddenly charged, slamming the male back as he reared up to avoid her outstretched claws. His own claws were sheathed.

With adaptations such as thick blubber and nostrils that close, polar bears are, in fact, highly aquatic. They spend most of their time hunting seals on sea ice and are capable of swimming for hours at a time. Souders took his Zodiac boat to Hudson Bay, Canada, in midsummer to rectify this bias. He scouted for three days before he spotted a bear, this young female, on sea ice about 30 miles offshore. The light was special but for a sinister reason. The midnight sun was filtered through smoke from forest fires raging farther south, a symptom of the warming Arctic – the greatest threat facing the polar bear. As more and more sea ice melts earlier and earlier each spring it becomes harder for the bears to hunt the seals they depend on",

The female spiders, which can grow to the size of a hand, create colossal conjoined webs up to 1.5m in diameter in which the tiny males gather. These are woven from extremely strong silk and are suspended up to six metres above the ground, high enough to catch passing bats and birds, though it’s flying insects that the spiders are after.

If it was snowing the result would be a mesmerising pattern of swirling steam and snowflakes, which would whirl around any macaques warming up in the pools. But capturing the moment required total luck – for Doest to be there when the wind blew and for the monkeys to be in the pool. For that luck to arrive he had to wait another year. Returning the next winter he determined to get the shot he’d been obsessing about.
