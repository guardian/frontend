With 18 miles of books, its staff talk about its past and present – and give reading recommendations","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>The Strand was born in 1927 on Fourth Avenue on what was then called “Book Row.” Book Row covered six city blocks and housed 48 bookstores. Ben Bass, an entrepreneur at heart and a reader by nature, was all of 25 years old when he began his modest used bookstore with 300 dollars of his own and 300 dollars that he borrowed from a friend. </p> <p>Ben sought to create a place where books would be loved, and book lovers could congregate. He named his bookstore after the London street where writers like Thackeray, Dickens, and Mill once gathered and interesting book publishers thrived. The Strand quickly became a Greenwich Village institution where writers went to converse, sell their books and find a hidden treasure to buy. Today, the Strand is the sole survivor of Book Row’s colorful past, boasting more than 18 miles of new, used, and rare books.<br /></p> <p><strong>What’s your favorite section in the store?</strong></p> <p>The Rare Book Room is truly a magical place, and the dollar carts are heaven for any thrifty booklover, but my favorite would have to be the children’s department, especially the classic and vintage sections. I really love an old book with some character or with a heartfelt dedication from a bygone era. <em>–Maya S, Kids Department</em></p> <p>I love the Literary Non-Fiction section the best. I was an English major in college and it is fantastic to have author biographies, memoirs, letters, essays, and critical theory all in one spot. <em>–Amanda W, Visual Merchandise</em></p> <p>I have a real soft spot for the Banned Books table on our main floor. Whenever we have school groups in the store, I always stop there and try to explain it. I’m glad we encourage readers to learn more about the fight for freedom of speech across the globe. <em>–Brianne S, Marketing Manager</em></p> <p>My favorite section is the dollar carts because of the variety of stuff out there at any given moment. I’m a firm believer that any book you’re looking for has been out there at least once, you just have to wait for it. Also, I am cheap! After that it would be photography. <em>–Jane K, Rare Books Manager</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d50f76f00c8dc7077e367d6b23cd0d744efc4891\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d50f76f00c8dc7077e367d6b23cd0d744efc4891/0_0_600_756/397.jpg\" alt=\"The Strand in its former home on Book Row in 1938\" width=\"397\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Strand in its former home on Book Row, in 1938.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My favorite section is the history section. There’s so much I don’t know about the world that I think I may get a little distracted when I shelve there because I’m writing down titles of books to read later.<em> –Cynthia G, Main Floor</em></p> <p>Fiction! I’m constantly trying to catch up on modern classics that I should’ve already read. I’m also a big fan of the music section at the Strand. There’s nothing more inspiring than a great musician’s biography.<em> –Omar A, Web Department</em></p> <p>My favorite section is probably the Modern Library wall, in the classics section on the main floor. I work in this section a lot and sometimes they drive me crazy, but I can’t stay mad at these little babies. Modern Library has been publishing classics at good prices since the early 1900s (and they’re still doing it), but my favorites that we sell are from the 1930s, 40s and 50s when he cover design was <a href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516zkhDOvtL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\">so</a> <a href=\"http://www.citynightsbooks.com/images/8000.jpg\">so</a> <a href=\"http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/450424/6093736/1268312726383/modernlib_loxpapers.jpg?token=CmabScvAnllWBwiYeO4iaWWD%2FK4%3D\">great</a>. When you pick one of these up, you know you’re looking at something someone could have found in, in the same store, decades and decades ago. <em>–Sky F, Main Floor</em></p> <p><strong>If you had infinite space what would you add?</strong></p> <p>I would add an off-the-beaten-path room that is semi-private to house the Bereavement section and a few others, as well as comfy chairs, so people can browse sensitive topics in a quieter, less trafficked area.<em> –Amanda W</em></p> <p>I would try to add some large, floor-to-ceiling windows on the second floor and set benches beside them. I’d then come to the store on my off hours to read there for hours. There is nothing like reading a book and having the sun shine on your back! <em>–Brianne S</em></p> <p>A bigger children’s section as well as more magazines and books in foreign languages. Also, not related to books, but I really wish we had a shop cat. Or two. <em>–Jane K</em></p> <p>More books! Rows and rows of books! And maybe some more seating, though it’s kind of nice to see people sitting on the wooden floors absorbed in a book. <em>–Cynthia G</em></p> <p>Besides a full-service deli in the break room, I’d love to see our already immense monographs section on the art floor expanded.<em> –Omar A</em></p> <p>If we had the space, I’d want to step up our comics game to match the books. Not that we don’t have a pretty dope comics section. But I’d really go underground with it. Buy stuff from some of those dealers. A whole section of longboxes. <em>–Uzodinma O, Shipping Department</em></p> <p>I would add an entire wing devoted to new releases from independent presses. <em>–Cassandra B, Main Floor</em></p> <p>A lounge where you can read your book and cuddle with puppies. <em>–Patrick F, Second Floor</em></p> <p>Italian Ice Stand. <em>–Joe M, Second Floor</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e4f2c2e5f2b9ce4340501b2cedf81f058f419e8\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4e4f2c2e5f2b9ce4340501b2cedf81f058f419e8/0_65_700_420/500.jpg\" alt=\"Strand-Interior\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I like the man who talks to himself discussing the changes we’ve made to the tables. Sometimes I think he knows the store better than I do.’</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What do you do better than any other bookstore?</strong></p> <p>I honestly believe we give the best recommendations. Everyone who works at Strand has a particular section they know inside-out. We also know each other’s specialty so if you don’t know a section all that well, you know who does and they get to spread their loved books to someone who is genuinely interested. <em>–Zoe K, Main Floor</em></p> <p>The Strand is part of an extinct breed of bookstores in New York City. We have the best range of used books, including recently published titles. We also have the best and most diverse art book selection in New York, and possibly in the world.<em> –Maya S</em></p> <p>What the Strand does best is find ways to get books at cheaper prices. Our owner has gone on trips to England to get super cheap British versions of books; searching out remainders from different sources; getting used books from a huge variety of places, visiting libraries, houses, and estates to get huge lots of books. <em>–Amanda W</em></p> <p>We cater to every lifestyle across the board with no exception. <em>–Omar A</em></p> <p>We’re still, I think, a prime example of a non-corporate, classic used bookstore. Dusty stacks, we still have the weird types, characters, the vibe, as well as some hard to find books I doubt you’d find anywhere else, even online. <em>–Uzodinma O</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc5a7034fbd2cf234e4872f67b7761bdbb2baeea\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dc5a7034fbd2cf234e4872f67b7761bdbb2baeea/0_0_600_394/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fred Bass, son of founder Ben Bass, with his wife Nancy in the store front in the 2000s.\" width=\"500\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fred Bass, son of founder Ben Bass, with his daughter Nancy in the store front in the 2000s.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Who’s your weirdest regular?</strong></p> <p>Who isn’t? Weirdos are what makes New York City great! One of my favorite aspects of this job is the wonderful people that you get to meet. <em>–Maya S</em></p> <p>The dogs who know where we keep the treats. I guess it’s not so much weird as adorable and amusing. –<em>Cynthia G</em></p> <p>Most of our regulars are unique. My favorites are the ones who strictly shop the bargain carts outside. There’s nothing wrong with being thrifty. <em>–Omar A</em></p> <p>The woman who comes in every week and asks for books related to Pharma and Biotech; then claims that she owns a biotech company yet only ever purchases half-priced mass markets.<em> –Sean C, Basement Manager</em></p> <p>The concentration of characters, I’d say, nowadays, is in the back, mainly the cats who come through to sell to our book buyers. The people who come in to sell run the gamut. There’s owners and dealers from other bookstores, college students, writers, university professors, homeless dudes. As you might imagine, some real raconteurs.<em> –Uzodinma O</em></p> <p>I like the man who talks to himself discussing the changes we’ve made to the tables. Sometimes I think he knows the store better than I do. <em>–Patrick F</em></p> <p><strong>What’s the craziest situation you’ve ever had to deal with in the store?</strong></p> <p>Crazy situations are stories best told in person but I will mention the drunk man who was escorted out while “Heil Hitler”-ing me. And the reality show episode that never aired. <em>–Jane K</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27cb1127572a24604f2c8a55d4d695ada1aae7f6\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/27cb1127572a24604f2c8a55d4d695ada1aae7f6/0_56_1240_744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rare, used books on display outside the store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rare, used books on display outside the store.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I first started working here Russell Brand came and did a signing. Earlier we had set up an area for him to do his signing, but when he arrived he announced to the line that he changed the location to the second floor and was now going to do a reading. It ended up working out alright, but it was chaos. <em>–Cynthia G</em></p> <p>I once had to calm two customers down who were fighting over a book. <em>–Omar A</em></p> <p>One summer there was this huge fight between a couple of employees that spilled out through the book carts on the sidewalk and onto Broadway. Middle of the afternoon, books scattered all in the street, everyone’s screaming. It’s a lot different now, but when I first started working here it was like the wild west. <em>–Uzodinma O</em></p> <p>One time a wealthy foreign customer bought half of our art monographs and I spent the day putting the books into 56 boxes so they could be shipped around the world. <em>–Patrick F</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It’s a lot different now, but when I first started working here it was like the wild west</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What’s your earliest/best memory about visiting a bookstore as a child?</strong></p> <p>I remember being ten or so and hanging out in the bookstore of whatever mall my family was shopping in. Those are the places I discovered poetry, wondered endlessly who Rebecca was and why Daphne Du Maurier wrote a book about her, and learned all about my body. Thanks, books! <em>–Jane K</em></p> <p>When I was growing up in the early 1960s there were no bookstores (or much of anything else for that matter) nearby. Instead I got books from book fairs at school. They were held in the All Purpose Room. A large room filled with tables stacked with books. They had such inviting covers. There were so many of them. My parents would only buy me one or two of them. It was tragic. There is so much promise in a roomful of unread books. <em>–Dave, Customer Service</em></p> <p>There was a local bookshop in Lancaster, CA whose name I can’t remember anymore. Hell, it’s probably closed down by now. I used to go there when I was a teenager with no cash just to sit around and read books. I read mainly Stephen King novels as I was a bit of a horror junkie at the time. I always told my dad I was looking for a job. But I wasn’t. It’s probably a mix between that innocent teenage rebellion and the welcoming atmosphere of the shop that makes this a good memory. <em>–Brian S, Rare Book Room</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6dd2c887da9e29ba5af9135d8ec10f4bfc9caf1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a6dd2c887da9e29ba5af9135d8ec10f4bfc9caf1/0_3_600_360/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fred Bass perusing books in the basement in the 1970s.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fred Bass perusing books in the basement in the 1970s.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were not any bookstores in the town I grew up in but taking out the maximum amount of books allowed per week, I think it was 12, from the local library is my fondest book-related memory from childhood. Second place is ordering scads of books from the Scholastic Book Club at school and winning a large gift basket of books after my entry in the 4th grade poetry contest won first prize. <em>–Sean C</em></p> <p>I have a kid, a son, so this is something I think a lot about. I was about my son’s age now, maybe seven or eight and the only thing my parents consistently bought me was books. Every couple of weeks. As soon as I’d finish a book they’d buy me another. We’d go to the mall and they had a B. Daltons and I want to say, a Waldenbooks. I know everyone in New York says they hate chain bookstores, but I logged in a lot of hours there just sitting on the floor reading comics and sci-fi books. <em>–Uzodinma O</em></p> <p>I would visit my brother working in the shelves and talk to him from the other side trying to freak him out. <em>–Joe M</em></p> <p><strong>If you weren’t working at a bookstore what would you be doing?</strong></p> <p>I’m a painter, so if I could paint full-time I would. But the Strand is a great place to work if you are an artist seeking inspiration. <em>–Maya S</em></p> <p>Probably teaching, which I did for a short period of time overseas. Never have I ever loved my teachers more than when I was on the other side of that desk. <em>–Jane K</em></p> <p>Writing, man, writing . . . I mean I don’t necessarily go around calling myself a writer, but my first book is, in fact, coming out at the end of the summer. <em>–Uzodinma O</em></p> <p>Dreaming of working in a bookstore! I have a second job at a year-round haunted house, so I’d just be working there more, but I’ve always wanted to work at a book store. I’m glad I get to work here. <em>–Cynthia G</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c4441e3152af66e34f833490cb9415c80b78642e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c4441e3152af66e34f833490cb9415c80b78642e/0_0_682_1024/666.jpg\" alt=\"Strand-Exterior2-682x1024\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strand-Exterior2-682x1024</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What’s been the biggest surprise about working at a bookstore?</strong></p> <p>I love how receptive customers are to my recommendations. When I did clothing retail, no one cared what I thought!<em> –Cassandra B</em></p> <p>The biggest surprise is you don’t get a lot of reading done. Instead, you make yourself into a book hoarder and make your to-read list into Mt. Everest or possibly K2 (especially since K2 it is the more dangerous mountain to climb). <em>–Zoe</em></p> <p>Working in the children’s department has opened my eyes to how amazing and strange all children are. I mean strange in the best way. <em>–Maya S</em></p> <p>(This is going to sound cheesy) I am surprised daily by the quantity and quality of the interactions I have with customers and co-workers alike. Being around so many people to talk about and share books with. Showing someone a book to help them through grief, having a customer recommend a great fun read to me, debating poetry versus prose with a co-worker. I grew up in a small rural town in Pennsylvania. No one read books but here, at this bookstore, are my people. <em>–Amanda W</em></p> <p>I am most surprised by how much I look forward to interacting with customers and helping them, chatting with them even when I can’t find the book they’re looking for. Even though we’re all about books at Strand the books wouldn’t be here without the folks to buy them! <em>–Jane K</em></p> <p>There’s always someone who is a bigger geek about any topic than you are. <em>–Omar A</em></p> <p>I’m sure for all of us it’s a little shocking to have to factor the realities of a business into something we love. <em>–Uzodinma O</em></p> <p>How much I’ve learned! Just in shelving books I’ve learned of many more authors and great works in various fields and getting to do tech for our events taught me how to work a P.A. system. <em>–Cynthia G</em></p> <h2>The Staff Shelf</h2> <p><strong>What are The Strand’s booksellers reading?</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"43ab59bc97f163351ce482b1265c835800a9b343\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/43ab59bc97f163351ce482b1265c835800a9b343/0_0_430_648/332.jpg\" alt=\"mourning-diary1\" width=\"332\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8158959-mourning-diary\">Mourning Diary</a> by Roland Barthes</strong> (2010). Amanda (visual merchandise) recommends: “Abandonitis n.- an inflamed sensitivity to/fear of abandonment; seeing it in all things (small or large); feeling completely separate, other (even with others around). This is one of the many aspects of grief that Roland Barthes captures so brutally in Mourning Diary. I have never read anything that encapsulates the suffering of grief with such directness and authenticity. Read it.”</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/days-of-abandonment.html\">The Days of Abandonment</a> by Elena Ferrante</strong> (2005). Brianne (marketing manager) recommends: “Everyone’s got <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/elena-ferrante-literary-sensation-nobody-knows\">Ferrante Fever</a> and I promise you, it’s not without warrant. My Brilliant Friend is nothing short of brilliant. Ferrante’s writing is as fierce as it is elegant, as razor sharp as it is oddly soothing. This is a book you will read in an afternoon but will stay with you for a lifetime. Ferrante displays the finest moments of female friendship, including the support, love, and wisdom yet doesn’t shy away from showing all of the bitter envy and tension that develops between close women. This is a book to share with your sisters, mothers, aunts, and above all else: your boyfriends.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"78ebe9b6dc034db1a40f8ad45e29481b300cbd27\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/78ebe9b6dc034db1a40f8ad45e29481b300cbd27/0_0_403_600/336.jpg\" alt=\"girl\" width=\"336\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/01/girl-in-a-band-a-memoir-kim-gordon-soni-indie-rock-role-modelc-youth-review\">Girl in a Band</a> by Kim Gordon</strong> (2015). Emily (events director) recommends: “<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/kim-gordon\">Kim Gordon</a> writes like she’s painting: places and people become layered to utterly specific, gripping depths and moods, such that the reader feels the need to reach out, to hold the page up and consider it like a piece of visual art. Not to mention, Kim’s book is one of the bravest, most unapologetic, and beautiful personal histories I’ve read in a long time. No character in the cast of her life, including herself, is spared the mirror.”</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/what-doctors-feel.html\">What Doctors Feel: How Emotions Affect the Practice of Medicine</a> by Danielle Ofri </strong>(2013). Cynthia (main floor) recommends: “This book is about various incidents involving sympathy or a lack thereof. I was impressed with Ofri and her admission of times where she didn’t feel enough for a patient. It’s a good insight to the emotional problems doctors experience, through the eyes of someone who wants things to improve.”</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f6999f9039e8293df38b0a65b598104697ba9ceb\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f6999f9039e8293df38b0a65b598104697ba9ceb/0_0_400_591/338.jpg\" alt=\"9780399252518 custom-924dd4d31f7bb7eb200cdc4ab20453f8fa19d7e1-s400-c85 (1)\" width=\"338\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821284-brown-girl-dreaming\">Brown Girl Dreaming</a> by Jacqueline Woodson</strong> (2014).

blur the lines between fact and fiction?","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, John le Carré has been looking for targets beyond the murky, mutual, spying of the cold war. He has directed his genuine and growing anger at more topical, straightforward, targets: a large pharmaceutical company (The Constant Gardener), extraordinary rendition (A Most Wanted Man), and Foreign Office/MI6 involvement in the work of private US military contractors (A Delicate Truth).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/20/the-night-manager-recap-episode-five-nothing-quite-as-pretty-as-napalm-at-night\">The Night Manager recap: episode five – 'nothing quite as pretty as napalm at night'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Twice in his later books, Le Carré (born David Cornwell) has acknowledged help from the human-rights charity Reprieve. He is no friend of MI6, nor of MI5, despite their attempts to forgive their former officer.</p> <p>His constant themes are corruption, money-laundering, rule-breaking and the moral equivalence between those supposedly on “our side” and the enemy. The Night Manager, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/20/the-night-manager-recap-episode-five-nothing-quite-as-pretty-as-napalm-at-night\" title=\"\">the much-discussed adaptation</a> now being shown on BBC1 on Sunday nights, is no exception. The question is how plausible it all is.</p> <p>Here are some guidelines. A very senior MI6 officer told the Chilcot inquiry that he and his colleagues were concerned about the UK joining the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, “not because we aimed to do something we knew was illegal, though, of course, by definition, all MI6 activity was illegal, but because we didn’t want to put our feet in the wrong place or get snagged.”</p> <p>The Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry heard that soon after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/chemical-ali-death-sentence-halabja-attack\" title=\"\">Saddam Hussein gassed Iraqi Kurds in Halabja</a> in 1988, a senior Foreign Office official wrote: “It could look very cynical if, so soon after expressing outrage over the Iraqi treatment of the Kurds, we adopt a more flexible approach to arms sales.”</p> <p>Whitehall did adopt a more flexible approach, but kept it quiet. MI6 was directly involved, with the CIA, in the abduction of two prominent Libyan dissidents subsequently tortured by Gaddafi’s secret police. Phoney companies are par for the course.</p> <p>So, The Night Manager may be surprisingly plausible, as brutal and deeply cynical elements in MI6 and the CIA protect Richard Roper’s illegal arms-dealing and shell companies. Ministry of Defence officials <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/18/military.ukcrime\" title=\"\">have been known to accept bribes</a>.</p> <p>Jonathan Pine’s infiltration of Roper’s outfit could certainly pass the plausibility test. Least plausible is Angela Burr. A former top MI6 officer would not get away with setting up a separate anti-arms-trader unit with links to the CIA. And would Roper’s contempt for Corky, his erstwhile front man, really blind him into trusting Pine so much, for so long?</p> <p>There are chauffeur-driven Mercedes rather than Aston Martins, and the villains – Roper and his friends – are archetypal Englishmen. There were some classic Le Carré lines in Sunday’s, penultimate, episode: “Anyone can betray anyone,” then, later, “the whole system keeps the country where we want it ... we made Richard Roper”.</p> <p>Yet Pine, helped by Roper’s girlfriend, Jed, is bringing Le Carré and Ian Fleming closer together, however much the incomparable inventor of George Smiley might not like it. No wonder Tom Hiddleston is hot favourite to be the new 007.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hm9j","wordcount":"503","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d9e5c811f8f828a44d9fa63a0638a17eb28e30fc/0_235_3600_2161/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-24T12:36:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The Sunday night adaptation of Le Carré’s arms-trading spy thriller is a TV sensation – but how far does it blur the lines between fact and fiction?</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/21/night-manager-john-le-carre-bbc-adaptation-plausible","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/mar/21/night-manager-john-le-carre-bbc-adaptation-plausible","sectionName":"Television & radio","elements":[{"id":"d9e5c811f8f828a44d9fa63a0638a17eb28e30fc","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d9e5c811f8f828a44d9fa63a0638a17eb28e30fc/0_235_3600_2161/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"WARNING: Use of this copyright image is subject to the terms of use of BBC Pictures' Digital Picture Service (BBC Pictures) as set out at www.bbcpictures.co.uk.

A bit withering, though he does go on to be generous about your adaptation. Is he right about the process, though?</strong></p> <p>He’s being witty, enjoying himself. I would say what you have to do as a screenwriter is strip the book back to find the skeleton. When you’ve found the skeleton – that’s what you trust – you reclothe. And you can reclothe [it] in ways that are different to the novel – in fact, you probably need to. If the skeleton isn’t there, you’re in trouble.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/20/the-night-manager-recap-episode-five-nothing-quite-as-pretty-as-napalm-at-night\">The Night Manager recap: episode five – 'nothing quite as pretty as napalm at night'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How was the The Night Manager’s skeleton?</strong></p> <p>Magnificent. Essentially, I would argue it’s the Faust myth, with a good angel and a bad angel whispering in his ear, and he’s not sure which one he’s more interested in, which one he trusts more, and to which he’s more attracted. Faust (obviously being Jonathan Pine) is a skeleton I can immediately trust and feel comfortable with. It’s very simple, but for me that’s why it works on screen, that central relationship between Pine and Richard Roper, with Angela Burr as the good angel in the other ear. It’s what holds the piece in a kind of tension that goes way beyond a spy novel and is something spiritual, emotional. I think Le Carré is a great, modernist writer, which is to say, in a godless world, he invokes deep, almost religious ideas of betrayal, trust, faith, and that’s why we love it. All that and you’ve got a wonderful, plotty narrative as well.</p> <p><strong>Did you feel that Le Carré was looking over your shoulder? </strong></p> <p>Once I’d met him and had the conversation, much less so. I think for any writer, when you write, you just write. Write first, worry later. It was largely an act of adoration doing this. I remember clearly watching Smiley’s People on television with my dad when I was 13 and it’s the same thing – understanding [how] a procedural espionage novel can also be a strangely emotional spiritual journey of one man. It felt like Heart of Darkness to me, even though it was just Alec Guinness meeting a bunch of people and trying to figure something out. So I wanted to do it because I’ve genuinely adored Le Carré’s work.</p> <p><strong>Would your dad be Charles Farr, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee?</strong></p> <p>You’ve got me! No, I’m joking. No relation. I think I might have had the brilliance to have a <em>nom de plume</em> if he was. He’s Martin Farr, surveyor … unless there’s something he’s not telling me.</p> <p><strong>Your big alterations, then: first turning Mr Burr into Mrs Burr. Is that because Le Carré doesn’t do substantial female characters?</strong></p> <p>Well, he does sometimes, but it so happened that this book didn’t have that Connie Sachs-type role. It was also relevant to updating it by 20 years or so. You’ve gone past 9/11, and the legacy of that in the intelligence services is simply far greater diversity of recruitment for very practical reasons, racial as well. There may still be some element of it but it’s not the old gentleman’s club any more. Women are granted high positions and it seemed anachronistic not to acknowledge that.</p> <p><strong>And shifting it forwards in time? </strong></p> <p>There’s a clear political anger in the book that attracted me, and I thought that would be blunted if we kept it in 1993/94. I had a simple instinct that it needed to be brought into our world and our day. The issue seemed to be broadly the same: exploitation of other parts of the world for western gain. It was true when I started adapting in 2013; it’s tragically more true now.</p> <p><strong>Not just gung-ho excitement, but serious commentary on the west’s conduct in the Middle East?</strong></p> <p>How serious is probably for someone else to say. Let’s be clear, it’s an espionage drama, not a discursive piece about the legacy of the Arab spring. But I certainly thought it through. It’s an area of the world I know a little bit about.</p> <p><strong>You’ve come from theatre, was it exciting writing for this kind of (massive) budget? </strong></p> <p>It was reassuring that no one said: “Oh, by the way, please adapt this novel that takes places across continents, but we have to film it in Shepperton,” or something. There was a sense that scale was possible, in fact, desirable. But I think film can be more restrictive – you know you’ve got this number of weeks to film here, whereas theatre is an imaginative space, where it’s up to you how to tell your story. The big difference is the size of the audience, and that is thrilling.</p> <p><strong>How will the second series work and how is it coming along? </strong></p> <p>Nothing to say on that, good try.</p> <p><strong>There have been a lot of rumours.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, nothing to say.</p> <p><em>The final episode of The Night Manager in on BBC1 next Sunday.

Judge and Sunday Times literary editor Andrew Holgate described McCann’s entry as a “gripping piece of meta-fiction”.</p> <p>The shortlist is completed by Canadian novelist Nicholas Ruddock’s The Phosphorescence, American writer Alix Christie’s The Dacha, and British author Jonathan Tel’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/commonwealth-short-story-prize-human-phonograph-by-jonathan-tel\">The Human Phonograph</a>, set on a Chinese nuclear base.

Interwar New York, a hair stylist in Africa, a dacha near East Berlin and a research station in China’s nuclear weapons programme – quite some breadth, in a collection of exceptionally accomplished stories.” </p> <p>The author Mark Haddon, who joined Holgate on the judging panel, said that it had been “interesting and salutary for a writer of short stories to note the breadth of often contradictory qualities that different members of the panel expected a really good short story to demonstrate”. The judging panel for the prize also includes the broadcaster and novelist Melvyn Bragg, critic Alex Clark and author Rose Tremain.</p> <p>“The lesson being: don’t expect to please every reader but whichever kind of reader you’re trying to please, make your story as near perfect as you can. Rewrite and edit, rinse and repeat,” said Haddon. “Irrespective of whether a particular story touched us, I think we all came to appreciate writers who had ironed out all those snarls and glitches which litter every writer’s early drafts and produced a final draft which felt truly finished.”</p> <p>The winner of the award will be announced on 22 April. The prize goes to a story in English of up to 6,000 words, by an author from anywhere in the world who has been published in the UK or Ireland. Previous winners include the Chinese writer Yiyun Li, and CK Stead from New Zealand.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hm94","wordcount":"484","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c8c9e5dac72a2315f82d734fa29423c272e1c54b/0_0_3000_1800/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-27T23:15:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Stories

Both rabbits and hares have a great many babies and that may be the reason why they are linked to Easter as it is seen as a season of growth and reproduction.<br /></p> <p>In general, rabbits in children’s books have little or nothing to do with Easter.

Published in 1902 it was the first of her long sequence of beautifully written and exquisitely illustrated stories about animals with human characteristics. Peter, one of a family of young rabbits, who has been expressly told by his mother not to go into Mr McGregor’s garden, does exactly that. Peter’s adventures in a place which offers great temptation but is also the scene of his father’s death, described warningly by Mrs Rabbit, “your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs McGregor.”, is one of the great adventures of children’s literature. Peter’s initial defiance, his growing terror and his final brave escape are all remarkably human; it is easy to see why The Tale of Peter Rabbit is one of the best-selling books of all time. Beatrix Potter studied rabbits closely and wrote other books about them including <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/story-of-a-fierce-bad-rabbit.html\">The Fierce Bad Rabbit</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tale-of-the-flopsy-bunnies-2.html\">The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"03941f00157ad1ee6b534c767b69010461670811\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/03941f00157ad1ee6b534c767b69010461670811/0_0_318_392/318.jpg\" alt=\"Uttley\" width=\"318\" height=\"392\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In Alison Uttley’s books about the motherly Little Grey Rabbit and her friends the animals are even nearer to humans than those created by Beatrix Potter. The series began in 1929 with <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-grey-rabbit-squirrel-the-hare-and-the-little-grey-r.html\">The Squirrel, the Hare and Little Grey Rabbi</a>t, illustrated by Margaret Tempest and Uttley continued writing about her animal characters until 1975. </p> <p>Little Grey Rabbit and her two friends live in a tidy little house on the edge of the woods and have adventures with woodland creatures including a hedgehog, a mole, a rat, a badger and an owl. Hare is the most bumptious of the characters and he is also the one who has a specific association with Easter in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hare-and-the-easter-eggs.html\">Hare and the Easter Eggs</a>. It’s a delightful story in which hare becomes entranced by all the sugary delights of Easter and especially by the wonderfulness of Easter eggs and determines to give some to all his friends. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"69b909426fa35699891223004ea8e476f2a38067\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/69b909426fa35699891223004ea8e476f2a38067/0_0_392_475/392.jpg\" alt=\"Foo Foo\" width=\"392\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Little Bunny Foo Foo, the star of a poem of the same name, is a much less mice natured creature than either Potter’s or Uttley’s. Instead, he is a nasty little creature who makes a habit of terrorising field mice. “Little Bunny Foo Foo/ Went hopping through the forest/ Scooping up the field mice/ And bopping them on the head”. Luckily, a good fairy turns up in the nick of time and Little Bunny Foo Foo has to learn some lessons. Michael Rosen’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-rabbit-foo-foo-3.html\">Little Rabbit Foo Foo</a>, illustrated by Arthur Robbins is an excellent presentation of the poem. </p> <p>Axel Scheffler has created a delightful pair of young rabbits in Pip and Posy, stars of a series of books for toddlers including <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pip-and-posy-the-super-scooter.html\">Pip and Posy: The Super Scooter</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pip-and-posy-the-scary-monster-2.html\">Pip and Posy: The Scary Monster</a> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/pip-and-posy-the-snowy-day-2.html\">Pip and Posy: The Snowy Day</a>. Although rabbitty (and mousey) to look at – except that they are wearing clothes - Pip and Posy’s activities, anxieties and delights are those of human toddlers too. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"319ad7c330ac8e3a9a4ebb17d71129ad0d3ec7ed\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/319ad7c330ac8e3a9a4ebb17d71129ad0d3ec7ed/0_0_2670_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pip and Posy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A pair of hares are the stars in Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram’s classic <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/guess-how-much-i-love-you-11.html\">Guess How Much I Love You</a>. In phrases such as “I love you right up to the moon- and back” and “I love you as high as I can hop”, Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare delight in telling each other just how much they love each other. </p> <p>The stuffed rabbit in Margery Williams’s much-loved <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/velveteen-rabbit.html\">The Velveteen Rabbit </a>wants something more than being loved: he wants to become real. Derided by the mechanical toys that he finds himself with, the Velveteen Rabbit has an aching desire to transformed and consoles himself with the wisdom he has learnt that toys <em>can</em> become real when they are loved enough. But when the boy who owns him is ill with scarlet fever, the Velveteen Rabbit, along with all the other toys, is bundled into a sack and sent off to be burnt. Luckily, the sack bursts and the Velveteen Rabbit survives, is rescued and then kissed by a fairy and becomes – real! William Nicholson’s illustrations capture the anguish of the Velveteen Rabbit in this classic story.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/feb/14/guess-how-much-i-love-you-in-pictures\">Guess how much I love you – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Who are your favourite bunnies and hares in children’s fiction?

The whiteness<br />sees with the eyes of lightning things<br />that don’t fit. It is eager.

His Collected Poems is a major achievement, enriching the habitat of contemporary letters in our own archipelago and beyond.<br /></p> <p>New Testament narratives of the discovery of Christ’s empty tomb bustle with social activity. The details vary, but in the traditionally harmonised account, a group of mourners arrives at the burial ground with spices for Christ’s body. They fail to recognise the presence of the angels and are distraught to find the body has disappeared – stolen, they infer. <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020&amp;version=KJV \">Saint John adds </a>a heart-stopping detail, when Mary Magdalene calls to a figure she believes to be the gardener and asks if he knows where the body could have been taken. He turns to her with a single word: “Mary.” She recognises his voice and exclaims, “Rabboni!” </p> <p> William Blake is concerned not with external effects but their cause. His subject, in <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1024529/the-resurrection-the-angel-rolling-watercolour-blake-william/\">The Resurrection: the angel rolling away the stone from the sepulchre</a>, is the central mystery of the resurrection narrative, a transformation the evangelists omit. He goes inside the sepulchre to try to capture the moment when God intervenes, and a corpse becomes a living man again. </p> <p> The resultant painting, executed in about 1805 in watercolour and pen and ink, is the subject of Inside the Spacious Tomb, a poem that appears in the second half of Robin Fulton’s collection. This substantial section of more recent work, subtitled Poems 1988-2010<em>,</em> is remarkably cohesive, seamlessly moving between two of the writer’s most characteristic genres, ekphrastic poetry and nature poetry. His poems about music please the eye no less than those about landscape: his elegant versification makes landscapes and artworks sing. </p> <p> Inside the Spacious Tomb has a particularly melodious beginning. The assonantal echoes in the opening lines (“white”, “wakened”, “brightness”, “faces”, “angels”) help recreate in audio Blake’s chiaroscuro effects, while the rhythm suggests the fluency of line in the painter’s depiction of light-catching cloth and flaring wings. There’s a little change of tempo, though, with “one left one right” – a brisk new march-step enhanced by the absence of commas. It reminds us of the orderliness of design in the painting, its symmetry and rigour. There are guards stationed outside the sepulchre in the gospel narrative. Blake’s angels form the interior guardianship.</p> <p> The poem’s depiction is spare and lean: geometric relationships seem central to its sharper-angled vision. In the second stanza, a blunt technical appraisal finds misalliance and faulty proportion, but places these flaws at the heart of the epiphany. It isn’t the poet or viewer alone who notes the oddities, but the “whiteness” itself (“the white glow from the wakened corpse”), which “sees with the eyes of lightning” and “is eager”. The caesuras of the fifth line of the second stanza form little jolts of excitement, anticipating a dawn unlike any other, which will “ambush the blind trees”. That image registers the supernatural fierceness and suddenness of the miracle. </p> <p> Another extraordinary event in the poem, not visual but temporal, is the abrupt compression of time (“eighteen centuries”) referred to in the tercet, after which a swift, slightly ironical transition to the mundane finds “Mr Blake” <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/william-blake/william-blakes-london/17-south-molton-street \">at home in London</a>. Blake, as we know, was hardly a stranger to angelic visions and visitations. The poem suggests that this time the angel was in the artwork. </p> <p> I suspect that word “startled” tells us that Blake, as imagined by the poet, found the shock of the resurrection he was inscribing in line and light inseparable from the shock of artistic fulfilment. Any such complexity is subtly, chastely rendered, in a poem that’s the distillation of a distillation, with a further mimetic refinement suggested by its physical presence in dark print on a white page. Inside the Spacious Tomb reminds us that creative artists, too, roll away stones, conjure lightning from darkness, and modestly assist at the resurrection of the dead.</p> <p>Happy spring holidays to all Poem of the week readers and writers!</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hm3p","wordcount":"770","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6ee721cdb199a32e80f33fb46ad0ba1480ee6bbf/0_149_2994_1797/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-27T23:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>This week’s poem has a Christian resurrection theme as it brings to life William Blake’s painting of angels rolling away the stone from Christ’s tomb</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/21/poem-of-the-week-inside-the-spacious-tomb-by-robin-fulton-macpherson","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/mar/21/poem-of-the-week-inside-the-spacious-tomb-by-robin-fulton-macpherson","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"6ee721cdb199a32e80f33fb46ad0ba1480ee6bbf","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6ee721cdb199a32e80f33fb46ad0ba1480ee6bbf/0_0_2994_4100/365.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Corbis.

Otherwise, the author of Kes thinks he has changed very little since he was a boy","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Barry Hines is a survivor of an educational system that has no time for academic runts. He was an average, working-class grammar school boy of the fifties, when clever workers’ lads could win through, and average middle-class sons could be pushed through. But to be average, socially and academically, was to be offered a glimpse of a brighter world before being ground into the unrelieved monotony of the colliery weigh office, the town hall, or any of a hundred repositories for boys too sharp to be plumbers but sharp enough to appreciate their fate.</p> <p>Football and athletics were the saving of Barry Hines. He was an England Grammar Schools footballer and an even-time sprinter, which gave him his only reasons to continue attending an establishment which, otherwise, he found an incomprehensible bore. Even so, he left at the age of 16, and became an apprentice mining surveyor, and with any luck, he might have been a colliery undermanager today. But surveying seemed to involve maths, at which Barry was very average, and since he only wanted to kick the ball and dash about, he returned to school after six months, where, to put it mildly, he played a blinder.</p> <p>He was still playing a blinder two years later, when time to go out into the world came round again; this time he had it all worked out, He went to carry on footballing and running at Loughborough College, where he would be trained as a teacher of PE, a career which offered unlimited opportunities for a lifetime of football and running.</p> <p>When he was 21, he read his first novel, and, rather late in terms of the system’s timetable, he developed. Seven years later, he thought he would like to write a small, unsensational novel about what it’s like to be a non-academic kid. He wrote it, and it became the basis of a small, unsensational film; Kes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56d77b9bbf5be2b93c3ed6dc4d702a7e98291170\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/56d77b9bbf5be2b93c3ed6dc4d702a7e98291170/0_0_1188_1781/667.jpg\" alt=\"A Kestrel for a Knave, Barry Hines.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Kestrel for a Knave, Barry Hines.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, Hines still lives in Hoyland Common where his dad was a miner, and he was a teenage football star. It’s a nondescript settlement between Barnsley and Rotherham, much like any other northern mining village - mixed gritstone and brick in a ribbon, with the colliery tip levelled after its heyday, and fields between for dogs and rabbits. And people who think little of literary success, and won’t talk a man silly with praise.</p> <p>Hines is a quiet, Yorkshire-voiced man of 31, who has two nice kids of his own, and teaches physical education to secondary children in Barnsley. He is the sort of lad I used to fight on the way home from school, out of respect: vigorous looking and a straight talker, who speaks his piece in your teeth and no messing, He recalled how he first realised that there was more to life than sport.</p> <p><strong>Read a book</strong><br />“I was in digs with a chap who took English as a second subject, and he had some books like, and one Sunday afternoon, I said, ‘Have got anything worth reading?’ because I was a bit bored, and he said, ‘Have a look at that,’ and it was Animal Farm. I think it was the first novel I’d actually read in my own time, and of my own volition. I’d actually sat down and read a book, and I was 21. Ridiculous. I can’t remember reading anything before.</p> <p>“Well, I enjoyed that book, and we had this English course at college, and I started doing a few short pieces, descriptions and that kind of thing, and I got decent marks and a bit of encouragement, so then I did one or two stories, and got them in the college magazine, and I started doing a bit of reading of my own in the library. And, I know this sounds like a cliche, but it was like a whole world opening up. I could see. Wheels started turning. I’d never heard of Ernest Hemingway, but when I read his stories I realised there was something special about this simple style, but I couldn’t understand how he got the effect. I realised there was something underneath it, and that’s how the whole thing started to unfold for me.”</p> <p>He decided that he would write seriously when he was settled, and after two years at a London comprehensive, and a further year at Loughborough, he returned home at the age of 24, married, and started writing Billy’s Last Stand, a play based on the village coalman. Hines was intrigued that the man should live an apparently unrecorded life, untroubled by forms, letters, or officialdom. He wrote with no medium in mind, and at epic length, completing the work in three months, and dispatching it to Alfred Bradley, head of Northern BBC radio drama, because “he sounded like a good bloke to send it to.” The play was eventually produced on the Third Programme in 1966, and today has just finished a run at the Royal Court’s Theatre Upstairs.</p> <p>On the strength of this success, he gave up teaching full-time, and spent five days a week writing his first novel, The Blinder, which was the story of a schoolboy footballing wizard who also happened to be brilliant academically - autobiography and wish-fulfilment combined, which started life in the unlikely guise of a Loughborough College third year thesis.</p> <p>“I produced this thing about a lad who discovered aesthetic pleasure in physical education, all very pretentious and important. I didn’t know how the hell they accepted it, because it was nothing to do with physical education, but I couldn’t stand the thought of doing the usual thesis, you know, esoteric subjects like the roll of the intercostal muscles in weightlifting and all that carry on. Anyway, the lad was very average in this thesis, so I thought I’d heighten it a bit all round, and in the novel I made him good at everything, with the result that a lot of people who read the book hate that lad. But I don’t find anything nasty about him; he was just an honest lad.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea018a3717175c18f718beff58d052c513959c62\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ea018a3717175c18f718beff58d052c513959c62/0_128_2538_1523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bradley plays Billy Casper in the film, Kes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bradley plays Billy Casper in the film, Kes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There followed a Home Service play about a football fanatic, Continental Size Six, which Hines considers to have been poor melodrama, and then Kestrel for a Knave, which Tony Garnett and Ken Leach used for the film. Hines says he simply tried to show what the life of a non-academic child amounts to - a story with no happy end. And that’s all.</p> <p>“I thought I would like to show that these kids can do something which is in fact very skilful - not the old tale about them being cobblers and joiners, but something that means they have to get books out of the library. And it’s a technical skill; they’ve actually got to read about it before they can do something like training a hawk. My brother trained a kestrel in these fields at the back, and I wanted to show that kids can do this kind of thing. They can do all kinds of things if only they’re given opportunities.”</p> <p><strong>Dead end system</strong><br />“The trouble in school is that you can do so little to help kids because you come up against this dead end of the educational system. I think a comprehensive system is the only answer for these kids, if it is carried through properly. But education reflects the system, rather than changes it. People say it’s an instrument of social change; well, if it is, it’s a bloody slow one. I think education reflects the class system, and the system has to change before education can.”</p> <p>“The function of a school is to realise the potential that all kids have, and to make them happy. To fit the curriculum to them instead of the other way round. At the moment, we just condition kids for their role in a competitive society, and the old guard insists that school is a different world with all this ‘yes sir, no sir’ stuff. It’s absurd.</p> <p>“The change will have to come through some kind of revolution, I’m talking about an educated workers’ revolution, and I feel almost embarrassed to talk about it because it sounds as if I’m jumping on a band-wagon. But I’m not; I don’t know much about Marxism, and it’s mainly a conclusion I’ve arrived at personally, through observing the way things are. The problem is, what do you do? Do you write about it, or get on with it? I mean, I wrote a book that was made into a decent film. It showed what it was like, and set the problems out, but does it actually do anything? It rallies the committed I suppose, but what is it actually doing? Sometimes I think I would like to be a full-time writer, but teaching is such a valuable job, and I feel strongly about it. So I think, well, stay in it then. Stop bloody complaining about it and get something done.”</p> <p>Hines realised a few weeks ago that he no longer opens the Guardian at the sports page first. He starts with arts, and follows with the leader. Now that he has lost the excitement of being a performer, he is concerned with other things than football. Otherwise, he thinks he has changed very little since he was a boy, and he is glad that his life continues to be unremarkable to the folk in the village.</p> <p>“I’m still Dick Hines’s lad here, and that’s all. There’s no literary talk here, and when I talk to people it’s about people, and about their work. I prefer this kind of existence; it keeps you sane; it keeps the temperature down, and makes you realise what’s important. You see, like my mother, she likes it that I’m a writer and all that, but she prefers the fact that I’m a teacher. That sort of thing brings you down to reality.”</p> <p>Barry Hines’s ambition is to go on writing and teaching. He’s working on a new novel at the moment, and there’s no sport in it. There’s a bit about teaching in it, but generally he says, it’s just about finding an honourable way of life. He doesn’t have to look too far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dfac96cf2c8745132c93358fd7b98002822b057\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0dfac96cf2c8745132c93358fd7b98002822b057/0_0_1504_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Guardian, 18 July 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"957\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian, 18 July 1970.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/20/barry-hines-obituary-a-kestrel-for-a-knave-author\"><em>Barry Hines obituary: author of A Kestrel for a Knave</em></a></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hm4g","wordcount":"1747","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/6439f89127781262d742b5a4f9ea9c4798fa2fca/0_143_3546_2128/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-24T12:15:00Z","standfirst":"<p><strong>18 July 1970</strong>: Barry Hines no longer opens the Guardian at the sports page.

He is very lonely and sad and even though he lives with his guardian (Mr. John Harrison), he doesn’t feel at home. Rusty is going through several emotions: he is confused, obliged, helpless, lonely and sad. He is confused because he is a young boy between the age of an adult and child and doesn’t know who to follow or what his future holds. He is obliged to follow the orders and rules of his guardian and dares not disobey him. He feels helpless because he knows that if he disobeys Mr. John, he will get caned. Rusty doesn’t have any real friends and he is so very lonely in his guardian’s house. </p> <p>Even though Rusty is half-Indian, John doesn’t let Rusty near the bazaar for a reason: John thinks that Indians are very dirty and this story is written just after the British had ruled over India, so he must have felt more superior! </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d98d062df1028815327860380319b0d7ff03eb6f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d98d062df1028815327860380319b0d7ff03eb6f/0_0_229_350/229.jpg\" alt=\"The Room on the Roof\" width=\"229\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>One day, Rusty decides to get some fresh air and takes a walk while his guardian was away in Delhi. After walking through the forest, he stops in front of the bazaar and his mind is arguing with his instinct. His mind is saying, <em>Don’t go! You will get into trouble</em>. But his instinct is saying, <em>Go! You have your own heart and mind. You don’t have to live under rules all the time</em>. Rusty chooses to follow his instinct and steps into the bazaar. </p> <p>He has made a good choice. Up until now, Rusty doesn’t have any hope or confidence but then he meets a kind boy named Somi and makes friends with him. Somi and his friends become Rusty’s hope and confidence, and Somi and Ranbir are really kind to Rusty. When Rusty returns home, he finds that his guardian has returned early and gets caned for going to the bazaar. The next day, he goes to play Holi with Ranbir and once again gets caned. Rusty now knows what he has to do. He starts to live his own life and runs away from his guardian’s house. Rusty finds Somi who supports him a lot. </p> <p>Slowly, from a confused boy, Rusty turns into a confident and independent young man! He gets a job teaching English to a boy named Kishen, in return for a tiny room on the roof and food. He finds a loving and fun family, his independence, and even finds his ‘first love’ in Kishen’s mother Meena. The story takes a turn, when he loses all his friends and his first love too. Now Rusty’s last source of confidence and hope has gone away and his lonely days return. Rusty spends his sad days looking out at the window and once again, plans to run away. He decides to go back to England but before doing so, he wants to say a last goodbye to his friends and finds Kishen who convinces him to change his mind about returning to the UK. Instead, the two walk away together to form their own new world and life without worrying about anything else.</p> <p> <strong>What I like about the book:</strong></p> <p>I like this book because it was written from a teenager’s perspective. The author was seventeen when he wrote this and the story was inspired by his own experiences when he lived in Dehra. He wrote this story because he too was feeling some of the emotions that Rusty was feeling in the story. And for that reason, he decided that he would never make any revisions so readers could understand how it feels to be seventeen. </p> <p>It was a great read because it has a lot of different emotions and I like the way Ruskin Bond has written it: a simple story made into such a touching and sad book. </p> <p>There were a few funny descriptions, such as when Ruskin Bond described a situation as: ‘When a butterfly landed on the missionary’s wife’s palatial bosom….’ I laughed a lot and when my mum read it, she also laughed. </p> <p>After reading Room on The Roof, I am looking forward to reading a few of Ruskin Bond’s other stories. I wonder why children of my generation don’t read more of his books. Here are some books I am interested in reading from his collection: Panther’s Moon and Other Stories, The Hidden Pool, and Rusty goes to London. </p> <p>I think the author has explained an important message in this book. Rusty’s guardian seems to be a little racist, who chooses to live in India but not mix with the people there. I think if people live in a country, they should mix with the people and appreciate their culture. </p> <p>The lesson in this story for me is to remain open as Rusty was and to follow my instincts. If Rusty had not becomes friends with the people of the bazaar he would never have had all the wonderful experiences in the story. </p> <p>Ruskin Bond reminds me of Roald Dahl because they both use interesting language and really funny phrases to describe their characters and their stories. They both write simple but wonderful stories. Even though, Roald Dahl is more fantastical and Ruskin Bond’s stories feel like memoirs but presented as a story. </p> <p> I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK A 9 OUT OF 10 RATING!</p> <h2><strong>Want to tell the

It seemed to me at the time that most children’s picture books were set in a mythical idyllic or fantasy countryside which was nothing like the experience of most contemporary children. I grew up in a flat in south London and spent a lot of time looking out of the window waiting for my mum to come home from work.

Norbury","headline":"Rain: Four Walks in English Weather by Melissa Harrison – review","trailText":"A guided tour of wet English landscapes offers extraordinary insights of the natural world","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/M_Z_Harrison\" title=\"\">Melissa Harrison</a> is having a prolific year. <em>Rain: Four Walks in English Weather</em> is the third book bearing her name to have surfaced already in 2016. February saw the paperback publication of her much-lauded second novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/01/at-hawthorn-time-melissa-harrison-review-fiction-nature-writing\" title=\"\"><em>At Hawthorn Time</em></a>, shortlisted for the Costa novel award 2015 and now longlisted for the Bailey’s prize announced on International Women’s Day. Also in February came <em>Spring</em>, the first of four books edited by Harrison, subtitled “an anthology of the changing seasons” with the other three to follow – in their season.</p> <p>The idea for <em>Rain</em>, Harrison tells us, “came to me in the Lake District …we walked from Keswick to Threlkeld along an old railway track … and it absolutely hossed it down, as the locals say”. It is a short book, 128 pages including the now almost compulsory glossary (since the glorious glossaries of Robert Macfarlane’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/08/landmarks-review-robert-macfarlane\" title=\"\"><em>Landmarks</em></a> and Dominick Tyler’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/09/uncommon-ground-a-world-lovers-guide-to-the-british-landscape\" title=\"\"><em>Uncommon Ground</em></a> last year), and is exactly what the subtitle says it is: four walks in English weather. Why four? It’s a number that seems to be significant for Harrison, and for a naturalist it is a good one – the four points of the compass, the seasons, the winds, the humours, the elements and more. Both her novels follow the lives of four apparently disconnected individuals united by a common landscape, and now there are the four seasonal anthologies. Finding connections – between characters, in the case of the novels, or landscapes and weathers, in the case of <em>Rain</em> – is a thread that runs throughout Harrison’s work. By looking closely, almost forensically, at the near-at-hand she teases out the wider picture, and despite her openly secular stance – she dismisses a chalk cross carved on a hillside – there is something mindful, almost Buddhist in her method.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A kingfisher unzips the air and a shrew lies dead on the path, probably drowned. A sparrowhawk is hunched in an ash tree</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The walks are either taken alone or in company and if I was frustrated by anything, it was in not knowing the identity of Harrison’s companion or the name of her dog, which slightly interfered with my total submersion as imaginary co-walker. I found myself scanning backwards and forwards, eventually locating them in the acknowledgments. The walks themselves take place in January, April, August and October 2014 around <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wicken-fen-nature-reserve\" title=\"\">Wicken Fen</a> in East Anglia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wrekin\" title=\"\">the Wrekin</a> in Shropshire, the <a href=\"http://www.kentdowns.org.uk/40-places/the-darent-valley\" title=\"\">Darent valley</a> in Kent and <a href=\"http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Dartmoor</a> in Devon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/wicken-fen-nature-reserve\" title=\"\">Wicken Fen</a> is the National Trust’s oldest nature reserve: “Species-rich, like ancient woodland or true wildflower meadows, this fragment of wild fen is an excellent place to see how man and nature together can work with, rather than against, nature.” Harrison is an intensely informative guide, and steers us effortlessly through 1,500 years of ingenious attempts to manage the watery flatlands, from the Roman dykes to the present-day hydroelectric pumps.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/08/olivia-laing-to-the-river\">To the River: A Journey Beneath the Surface by Olivia Laing – review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the day that she visits, “stratiform precipitation” is falling from “nimbostratus: rain caused by warm air rising gently and slowly over a cold front and condensing into water droplets”. In other words, and Harrison provides the translation: “that grey, unchanging kind of weather that can spread over vast areas and doesn’t go anywhere fast”. In addition to being a guide, Harrison is a patient teacher, using the proper names for meteorological phenomena, but then unpacking them into digestible layman’s terms. She directs our gaze towards a multiplicity of wildlife. Two woodpeckers on a grass verge are looking, she tells us, for ants; moles, attracted by the shallow, less compacted ground produced by wet weather, leave evidence of their passing; and worms, which any enthusiastic “worm-charming child” knows, break surface as a result of the tapping rain (though you can replicate the effect with a watering can). A kingfisher “unzips the air”, widgeon drift and a shrew lies dead on the path, probably drowned. A sparrowhawk is hunched in a leafless ash tree, goldfinches riot.</p> <p>However, it’s not all pastoral idyll. Engine-oil bottles and bits of old carpet are stuffed or blown into hedgerows along with rotting newspapers. Harrison finds herself unable to “read” the farmed arable land, and in this simple statement the tension between farmer and naturalist briefly surfaces: “We laymen have largely lost interest in where our food comes from beyond what’s written … on the packet.” Harrison’s candour is a delicate acknowledgment of the imperative to heal the schism between farmers, often struggling to make ends meet, and the rest of us, including naturalists critical of their conservation methods.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is an unashamedly English book, yet one far away from the problematic associations of nationalism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>April brings Harrison to an Easter walk through Shropshire lanes on a day of “sunshine and showers”. She shares her close knowledge of the changing season, the “huge, creamy candles” of horse chestnuts not yet open, “the pollen … still locked up safely inside the ripening green buds”. As well as speculating about what she knows to be there but cannot see, Harrison furnishes us with folklore, weather rhymes and a history of the attempts to measure rain, including the work of 3,408 volunteer observers who, in 1900, were “drawn from nearly every social grade from peer to peasant” by the <a href=\"http://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/150-years-of-the-british-rainfall-organisation/\" title=\"\">British Rainfall Organisation</a>. In August she weathers a thunderstorm by the river Darent before ending her sojourns on an October day of fine misty rain – mizzle – retracing paths she learned as a child and ending, poignantly, at the place where her mother’s ashes remain. I was reminded, on more than one occasion, of James Joyce’s The Dead, but with rain instead of snow “falling … upon all the living and the dead.”</p> <p><em>Rain</em> was completed in November 2014. Since December 2015 we have witnessed the destructive power of English floodwater, especially for Cumbria, in a way that was only beginning to assert itself at the time of writing. Harrison refers to the Somerset floods of 2014 and the “long hangover from the excesses of our industrial revolution … only now beginning to bite”, and she acknowledges but does not dwell on this legacy. For <em>Rain</em> is a fascinating exploration, a celebration and a meditation on that curiously English obsession. This is an unashamedly English book, yet one far away from the problematic associations of nationalism and closer to a more deeply felt and older connection with the landscape, and that is an achievement to be celebrated in itself. Harrison is a welcome and modest companion, one who shares her extraordinary knowledge and acknowledges “my year of getting wet… has broadened and deepened my feeling for the outside world.

we believe to be our mortal enemies aren’t so very different from us after all. At a time when the world is filled with huge divides between sexes, races, religions and more, this book couldn’t be more fitting. </p> <p>The heroine, K, begins by hating a group named ‘The Brotherhood’ because it’s what she’s been taught to do but when she’s sent on an undercover mission by Oskar, she realises that the people who she believed to be inhumane monsters are actually human beings, just like her. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"276741ace630655cb6a818a18c58ae8c6f6cdbe2\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/276741ace630655cb6a818a18c58ae8c6f6cdbe2/0_0_310_475/310.jpg\" alt=\"One of Us\" width=\"310\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The world that K lives in is very similar to our own, with two warring ‘tribes’ called ‘The Brotherhood’ and ‘The Citizens’ attempting to co-exist following a twelve­ year ­long battle known as ‘the Strife’ and each believes that they’re better than the other and that their ideologies are right. However, the majority of ‘Citizens’ and ‘Hoods’ don’t take things to the extreme of bombing a tube station. And that’s where the story begins. Twelve years prior to the start of the story, there was a similar bombing at ‘Central Station’ that was blamed on a pair of suicide bombers from the Brotherhood. Twelve years later, following another bombing which people fear will make the Strife begin again, K pretends to be the bomber’s daughter, Verity Nekton, in order to gain access to the Brotherhood and all it’s secrets. <br /> <br />However, whilst K initially embarks on her mission determined to discover a sleeper cell of potential bombers, she discovers a history which stretches way back to before she was born and she begins to question what is good and bad and whether the people that she believes she’s working for are actually on the ‘good’ side after all. <br /> <br />Overall, One of Us is a compelling story about how terrorism ravages our society as well as how in a world which seems to be hard and lacking compassion, human love can triumph even in the most impossible of circumstances. Jeannie Waudby’s debut novel is exciting and impossible to put down, with action and even a little romance present on each page and I can honestly say that I’d thoroughly recommend it.</p> <p><strong>• Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/one-of-us.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></p> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read?

Luckily, these are qualities our little island does well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"400b551253bb704b8b4541956c5af2e51a25276e\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/400b551253bb704b8b4541956c5af2e51a25276e/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"fd\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>As I grew older, like most teens, I started reading “the classics”, both in school and out. I wanted to educate myself, be a grown-up, have Deep Thoughts – when I wasn’t getting into trouble or listening to music too loud or thinking about boys, of course. But when I was about seventeen along came a comic called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_(magazine)\">Deadline</a>, featuring the most anarchic character of all – Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett’s Tank Girl. And I reverted right back to the eccentricity of childhood and found my soulmate.</p> <p>Although she was written and illustrated by two men, Tank Girl was not at all male-gazey, like so many American superheroines. Yes, she was attractive – but in a grubby, punk way, and she was also hilarious, drove a tank, and farted and picked her nose and swore like a sailor with a stubbed toe. In other words, although the whole world of Tank Girl – which was theoretically set in a post-apocalyptic Australia, though actually as British as Earl Grey tea – was out-and-out fantasy, Tank Girl was a layered, three-dimensional character busting with personality. She was real to me.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/sep/09/female-characters-comics-graphic-novels-sexism\">Why are comics and graphic novels still sexist?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even better, for someone who spent part of her childhood and teen years in a deadly dull English seaside town full of grannies, Hewlett and Martin hailed from the exact same town. If they could come up with something as deliciously crazy and colourful while living in Dullsville, maybe I could too! Reading Tank Girl at 17, it felt like it was written just for me – sure it was set in a fantasyland, but there’d be odd little mentions of my hometown, or <a href=\"http://www.pixiesmusic.com/\">Pixies</a> lyrics (my favourite band at the time) scrawled randomly under a panel. </p> <p>Although I didn’t write anything more than angsty poetry as a teen, and wouldn’t write my first novel for many years to come, the seeds were sown. Hewlett and Martin – along with similarly funny and anarchic illustrated books like Molesworth and St Trinians and the Addams Family – inspired me. And when, as a grown-up, the first novels I wrote turned out to be funny, irreverent, somewhat anarchic kids books set in Hell… well, I think I know who to blame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dfb3f3585081156fcd9cd9bc2e570f7440ef285d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dfb3f3585081156fcd9cd9bc2e570f7440ef285d/0_0_507_756/335.jpg\" alt=\"gf\" width=\"335\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Tatum Flynn’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/275351/\">The D’Evil Diaries</a> and The De’Evil Diaries <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/360433/\">Hell’s Belles </a>are available from the Guardian Bookshop.</em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"Tank Girl was hilarious, drove a tank, farted, picked her nose and swore like a sailor with a stubbed toe – and she was a feminist landmark in comic book history.

Simone","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Her handwriting rages across the page, its strokes straight, its tone unmistakable. “I love you – but you make me sick – cause you’re dead … You don’t even love me – you worship me but that’s a far cry from love, motherfucker.” This is Nina Simone’s voice in the ink, blazing, harsh and direct, far from the deep, soulful sound that soars out of her records.</p> <p>But both voices are Simone. The tumultuous life story of the extraordinary musician has been documented before, most notably (and erratically) in her 1992 memoir, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Put-Spell-On-You-Autobiography/dp/0306813270\" title=\"\"><em>I Put a Spell on You</em></a>. Autobiographies aren’t always reliable things, especially when their subjects have struggled with drugs and debilitating breakdowns. But that’s not to knock Simone’s powerful personality. As determined as she was fragile, as intelligent as she was sometimes submissive before men (although that’s her husband-manager, Andrew Stroud, being annihilated in that handwritten note), capturing her on the page is a challenging task.</p> <p><em>New York Times</em> journalist <a href=\"http://authors.simonandschuster.co.uk/Alan-Light/84873627\" title=\"\">Alan Light</a> was given that job by the company who made the Oscar-nominated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moOQXZxriKY\" title=\"\">2015 Netflix documentary</a> of the same name. Sensing there was more gold to be had from the material they’d gathered, they gave Light access to Simone’s letters, plus the ear of her only daughter, Lisa. In a recent US interview, Light talked of wanting to leave no “unanswered strands” to Simone’s story, but his main sources were unreliable and long dead. “It’s a frustrating story and a frustrating read,” he admitted of his book, rather bravely. He’s right. <em>What Happened, Miss Simone?</em> is a question fighting for an answer that never comes over its 300-plus pages.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moOQXZxriKY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/moOQXZxriKY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for the documentary, What Happened, Miss Simone?</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Still, for those who don’t know Simone’s story, it’s a good primer. Its facts flame for themselves. The sixth of eight children born to a methodist preacher mother and a handyman father becomes a child prodigy on the piano by the age of three – that’s an opener. However, Light overeggs this pudding by claiming Simone knew what musical notes were on paper by the age of six months – an even tougher thing, one imagines, to verify. He is better when interrogating Simone’s belief that she was <a href=\"http://www.classicalite.com/articles/26810/20150818/nina-simone-rejected-curtis-institute-grounds-race.htm\" title=\"\">denied a classical music scholarship to the Curtis Institute</a> because of her race, noting that a black woman was already studying there. He explores the huge impact she made for civil rights through her music, as well as her activism, nevertheless.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Simone sees two psychiatrists afterwards to see if should still marry her fiancé. Unbelievably, she did</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Light is also good at cherrypicking anecdotes that reveal Simone’s strangeness from the first days of her fame. There’s the night in 1960 when she arrives on stage at the Apollo theatre and spreads out her fee on the top of her piano before playing. She then tries to take it backstage, before falling flat on her face. Later on, he recounts her month of night-long <a href=\"http://time.com/4176079/david-bowie-nina-simone/\" title=\"\">phone calls with David Bowie</a>, who repeatedly tells her she’s not crazy. He also documents from multiple perspectives the violent beating and alleged rape given to Simone by Stroud on the night of their engagement, and how Simone sees two psychiatrists afterwards to see if should still marry her fiancé. Unbelievably, she did.</p> <p>Light’s admirable approach often gets in the way of conveying the glory of Simone’s career, though. The artist’s confusions about her sexuality, bankability, political clout and art are fascinating areas to mine, but the music in them is often muted by the fact-checking. The shimmer comes back when Light includes a few images of her letters and telegrams, or quotes directly from her diaries. As she writes in 1969: “It’s amazing to me how I can feel the tension &amp; sickness leaving – last nite I cried – I knew the ‘Black Bird’ is clean inside.” Blazing, direct and unforgettable: we need that extraordinary voice.</p> <p><em>What Happened, Miss Simone is published by </em>Canongate (£20). <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/377453/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Click here to buy it for £16</a></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hgv5","wordcount":"661","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/0abf64f25bee74db94aa8f29e21bb22acb824407/760_42_3320_1993/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","standfirst":"From her raging, handwritten letters to late-night phone calls with David Bowie, this biography gets up close and personal with the tempestuous Nina Simone"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/21/what-happened-miss-simone-andrew-light-book-review","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/mar/21/what-happened-miss-simone-andrew-light-book-review","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"0abf64f25bee74db94aa8f29e21bb22acb824407","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/0abf64f25bee74db94aa8f29e21bb22acb824407/760_42_3320_1993/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"1968 Getty Images","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/0abf64f25bee74db94aa8f29e21bb22acb824407","suppliersReference":"Nina Simone","altText":"‘Blazing, harsh and direct’: Nina Simone at the Newport Jazz Festival , Rhode Island in 1968.

Despite the urban turmoil facing the player as a member of the titular organisation charged with restoring order, it’s hard not to be impressed by the sheer scale.</p> <p>Thankfully, it’s more than just an impressive facade. Although the similarities to the likes of <em>Destiny</em> or <em>Borderlands</em> are undeniable, <em>The Division</em> improves on both in key areas. Weapon choice matters, each gun feeling notably different to wield, while character build – such as combat preference, choice of support skills, and gear load-outs – has a notable impact on both solo play and effectiveness in a team.</p> <p>However, while story missions have varied objectives, actual gameplay often boils down to diving for cover and shooting enough enemies to progress. For all its charms elsewhere, familiarity is <em>The Division</em>’s worst enemy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e98b42cd44b4ef8974e9a386abe3e2778c505791\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e98b42cd44b4ef8974e9a386abe3e2778c505791/115_0_1085_651/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pokkén Tournament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pokémon meets Tekken in Pokkén Tournament.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-gb/\" title=\"\"><strong>Pokkén Tournament</strong></a></h2> <p>(Wii U, Nintendo, cert: 7, out now)</p> <p>★★★★</p> <p>A <em>Tekken</em> spinoff featuring Pokémon characters may seem a strange prospect, but in fact <em>Pokkén Tournament </em>fulfils a promise the original Game Boy entries made 20 years ago – actual, real-time Pokémon battles. Surprisingly, <em>Pokkén</em> is also a more than competent fighting game. There’s a depth to battle mechanics belied by the colourful spectacle of seeing Pikachu and pals unleashed, and while it won’t dethrone more hardcore titles, it is solid enough to stand alongside them.</p> <p>However, <em>Pokkén</em> does play quite differently to its peers. Each round shifts between “field phase”, where players test limits with ranged attacks, searching for openings, and “duel phase”, where the up-close <em>Tekken</em> influence becomes clear. Special moves are perhaps too simple to use, but here it’s timing rather than complex combos that matter. Most importantly, it’s well balanced. Like the RPGs, each Pokémon has strengths and weaknesses that canny players will be able to leverage to victory. A curiosity to be sure, but a fantastic one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ecbffa63a3ec363359388e3eb31af7cd40d8f4a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1ecbffa63a3ec363359388e3eb31af7cd40d8f4a/59_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samurai Warriors 4: Empires.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Battle commences in feudal Japan in Samurai Warriors 4: Empires.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.samuraiwarriors4.eu/empires/\" title=\"\"><strong>Samurai Warriors 4: Empires</strong></a></h2> <p>(PS4, PS3, Koei Tecmo, cert: 12, out now)</p> <p>★★★</p> <p>The sheer volume of <em>Warriors</em> games often reduces the franchise to an indistinct blur of swordplay and fallen foes. The <em>Samurai Warriors</em> sub-series is, arguably, guiltiest of all, each offering only minor variations on gameplay while retreading key battles in Japan’s feudal history.</p> <p>Thankfully, <em>Empires</em> makes waging the likes of the Battle of Sekigahara – again – a more enticing prospect, blending familiar hack-and-slash with a hefty dose of actual strategy and resource management. As one of several daimyo, players tackle rival clans seeking either national dominion or more personal objectives, while engaging in politics between conflicts. Building a castle and taking counsel from advisers has a direct impact on military strength, while relationships between your lieutenants can affect resource production and, in turn, a burgeoning empire.</p> <p>With new features such as political marriages, series devotees will find plenty of nuanced details to warrant returning, while newcomers and sceptics may be surprised by the balance of tactical depth and cathartic – if repetitive – action.</p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hjqp","wordcount":"541","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/508e7fdbf4521b44b4f20d1b28be2c5a7f542680/0_110_1390_834/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","standfirst":"New

Yet in the ongoing, brutal clash of Islam and the west, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/26/guardianobituaries.highereducation\" title=\"\">Edward Said</a>’s analysis remains the book to which no combatant can be indifferent.</p> <p><em>Orientalism</em> is a profoundly influential and controversial study of the way in which, for at least 2,000 years, ever since the wars between the ancient Greeks and the Persians, the west has fought with, and largely dominated, the east through a persuasive colonial version of its culture and politics. Said’s masterpiece has been topical ever since its publication shortly before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/feb/03/iranian-revolution-archive\" title=\"\">1979 Iranian revolution</a>. Today, in an even more unstable world, it must be ranked high on any list of key texts related to the contemporary sociopolitical crises of the 21st century.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/28/highereducation.israelandthepalestinians\" title=\"\">Said</a>, a highly sophisticated and brilliant public intellectual, drew on his experience as an Arab-Palestinian living in the west to examine the way in which, from cu lture to religion, the west imperialised the ancient and complex societies of north Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. He would argue that the Gulf wars, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/02/alqaida.highereducation\" title=\"\">catastrophe of Iraq</a>, are a direct consequence of a fateful and crude ideology rooted deeply in the western mind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He would argue that the Gulf wars, and Iraq, are a direct consequence of a crude ideology rooted deeply in the west</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Any summary of Said’s immensely subtle analysis of western attitudes and conduct towards the east risks becoming a travesty. However, in simplified terms, <em>Orientalism</em> examines the history of how the west, especially the empires of Britain and France, created a thought process to deal with the “otherness” of eastern society, customs and beliefs. As Said himself puts it, “I study orientalism as a dynamic exchange between individual authors and the large political concerns shaped by the three great empires (British, French, American), in whose intellectual and imaginative territory the writing was produced.”</p> <p>The authors in question include Homer and the Greek playwrights such as Aeschylus who first characterised the Persians of “the east” in their dramas as exotic and inscrutable, stereotypes that Said shows subsequently to permeate the works of writers such as Flaubert, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/02/sybil-benjamin-disraeli-100-best-novels\" title=\"\">young Disraeli</a>, and Kipling, whose accounts of “the east” fed the west’s fascination with the orient. Said further sharpened the political edge of this narrative by showing how such ideas could be seen as a direct reflection of European racism and imperialism.</p> <p>After the publication of <em>Orientalism</em> set off a firestorm of criticism from every angle of the east-west divide, Said declared, in a retrospective essay, that “the orient-versus-occident opposition was both misleading and highly undesirable; the less it was given credit for actually describing anything more than a fascinating history of interpretations and contesting interests, the better”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/02/alqaida.highereducation\">Edward Said: Myth and misinterpretation of 'the orient'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These were vain hopes. In the nearly 40 years since <em>Orientalism</em> first appeared, the Middle East, the Arabs and Islam have continued to fuel enormous change, struggle, controversy and, most recently, warfare. Said, a pugnacious advocate for an independent state of Palestine became drawn into some visceral arguments in a way that helped politicise a book whose scholarly first intent had been to use, in Said’s words, a “humanistic critique to introduce a longer sequence of thought and analysis to replace the short bursts of thought-stopping fury that so imprison us”.</p> <p>Said always longed for elegance and sophistication in argument. “I have called what I try to do ‘humanism’,” he wrote, a word that might surprise those who found him consistently combative and unforgiving in argument. But he was unrepentant. “By humanism I mean first of all attempting to dissolve <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/03/poetry.williamblake1\" title=\"\">Blake’s mind-forged manacles</a> so as to be able to use one’s mind historically and rationally for the purposes of reflective understanding and genuine disclosure. Moreover, humanism is sustained by a sense of community with other interpreters and other societies and periods: strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an isolated humanist.” Perhaps it was Said’s tragedy that he should practise his craft as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/05/features.review3\" title=\"\">great literary critic</a> in an age which has had no patience with the subtleties of language, and no serious appetite for the nuances of a complicated idea. During Said’s professional life, almost every aspect of his study became reduced to slogans and violent posturing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/28/highereducation.israelandthepalestinians\">Christopher Hitchens: My friend Edward Said</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed, just before Said died in 2003, he noted with dismay the continuing impact of “orientalist” ideology on the west: “Bookstores in the US,” he wrote, “are filled with shabby screeds bearing screaming headlines about Islam and terror, Islam exposed, the Arab threat and the Muslim menace, all of them written by political polemicists pretending to knowledge imparted by experts who have supposedly penetrated to the heart of these strange oriental people...”</p> <p>As the US and the western powers continue to grapple with the crisis of Islam in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, and Libya, while desperately appeasing the oil-rich princes of Arabia, <em>Orientalism</em> will remain the text to which the Foreign Office and the State Department will have to return to replenish their search for mutual understanding in the conflict between east and west.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Said was a vociferous enemy of theories about the “clash of civilisations”... he argued for intellectual progress</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Said was always a vociferous enemy of theories about the “clash of civilisations”. With great elegance and clarity, he argued for intellectual progress. “One of the great advances,” he wrote as the <em>Orientalism</em> controversy raged around him, “is the realisation that cultures are hybrid and heterogeneous, and that cultures and civilisations are so interrelated and interdependent as to beggar any simply delineated description of their individuality.” How, he went on, “can one speak of ‘western civilisation’ except as an ideological fiction that gave the western nations their present mixed identities? This is especially true of the United States, which today can only be described as an enormous palimpsest of different races and cultures sharing a problematic history of conquests, exterminations, and of course major cultural and political achievements.”</p> <p>In words that might provide an epigraph to this series, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/29/italo-calvino-letters-review\" title=\"\">Italo Calvino</a> once said that a classic is a book that has “never finished what it wants to say”. <em>Orientalism</em> is such a book.</p> <h2>A Signature Sentence<br /></h2> <p>“No former ‘oriental’ will be comforted by the thought that having been an oriental himself he is likely – too likely – to study new ‘orientals’ – or ‘occidentals’ of his own making.

The jury had reached a verdict. “If only you were prepared to release the letter, Emma, you would win your case against your brother Giles’s first wife the Evil Lady Victoria,” said the barrister. “I can’t because it would be too damaging to my brother and he would no longer be able to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate,” sobbed Emma. “Don’t worry about me, I just want the truth to come out,” said Giles Barrington. The jury immediately changed their verdict. Emma had won.</p> <p>* * *<br /></p> <p>Harry Clifton sat down to tell a complete stranger the unlikely backstory of the previous five books in the series, before ringing his publisher in New York. “I’ve some good news for you,” said Harry. “I’ve just memorised the entire 80,000-word manuscript of the memoirs of the brilliant Russian dissident Jeffrey Archerov whom I met whilst we were both being held in Belmarsh on trumped-up charges.”</p> <p>“That’s great,” replied the publisher. “I will give you £100,000 in cash. By the way, all your novels are now at number one in every bestseller list throughout the world.” Harry allowed himself a smile of satisfaction as his great hero <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/john-buchan\">John Buchan</a> would have done.</p> <p>* * *<br /></p> <p>Evil Lady Victoria had just been turned away from Coutts after she complained that one of her cheques had bounced. When she got home, she read in the Daily Telegraph that the American multi-millionaire Cyrus Grant was in London. “I know what I’ll do,” she said to herself. “I will get him to think that he got me pregnant and then he will give me a million pounds to keep quiet.”<br /></p> <p>“I will give you a million pounds to keep quiet,” said Cyrus Grant.</p> <p>* * *<br /></p> <p>“I’ve got a very cunning plan to bring down the Barringtons and the Cliftons,” said Major Mellors. “I do hope it involves some insider trading, I’m good at that,” said Mr Sloane. “Drat, foiled again,” cried Major Mellors and Mr Sloane. “Those clever Barringtons and Cliftons have outwitted us again.”</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>“Shall we tell Giles that his new girlfriend, Karin, is actually a Stasi spy?” said the director general of MI6. “Why don’t we use her for our own ends?” suggested the director-general of MI5. </p> <p>“Would you like to be in the House of Lords, Giles?” said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\">Harold Wilson</a>. “I think Margaret Thatcher has a lot going for her,” said Emma. “I wouldn’t be at all surprised if she became Britain’s first woman Prime Minister.”</p> <p>“I know I used to be a Stasi spy,” wept Karin. “But now I love Giles very much and want to become a spy for the British without him knowing.”</p> <p>* * *<br /></p> <p>Sebastian Clifton sometimes thought about Samantha, the woman he loved very dearly in the US, and their daughter Jessica. But he had promised himself he wouldn’t make contact while her husband was still in a coma. Chatting to Mick Jagger at Lords one day, Sebastian met a very beautiful Indian woman called Priya. “I love you Priya,” he said. “I love you, too,” she replied. “Let’s get married.”</p> <p>As they tried to elope, her father shot Priya dead and badly wounded Sebastian. While Sebastian was recovering in hospital he received a phone call from the US. Samantha’s husband had died at last. “Book me a first-class ticket to Washington immediately,” he ordered his secretary. “What about Priya?” “Priya who?”</p> <p>Within 12 hours, Sebastian was reunited with Samantha and Jessica. “I’ve always loved you,” he said. “I’ve always loved you, too,” she replied.</p> <p>* * *<br /></p> <p>“I’ve got a very cunning plan to bring down the Barringtons and the Cliftons,” said Major Mellors. “I do hope it involves trafficking heroin. I’m good at that,” said Mr Sloane. “Drat, foiled again,” cried Major Mellors and Mr Sloane. “Those clever Barringtons and Cliftons have outwitted us again.”</p> <p>* * *<br /></p> <p>“That’s a nuisance,” said Evil Lady Victoria. “Cyrus Grant has stopped paying me lots of money. Now I’m broke again.”<br /></p> <p>* * *<br /></p> <p>The call came through from Sweden. Jeffrey Archerov had finally been awarded the Nobel prize for literature. “It’s no more than he deserved,” said Harry. “Bad news, I’m afraid,” said the Noble committee. “Jeffrey Archerov has unexpectedly died.”</p> <p>“Never mind,” said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/archer\">Jeffrey Archer</a>. “I’ll accept it on his behalf.”</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong>

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"715","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/45xtn","wordcount":"3166","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608387704/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","standfirst":"<p>Alex Malarkey co-wrote a bestselling book about a near-death experience – and then last week admitted he made it up.

high-quality, absorbing, easy-to-read African love stories set in cities as diverse as Lagos, Cape Town, and Jos and they’ve had African literary experts buzzing on Twitter for weeks.<br /></p>

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep.

This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you.

great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"439","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside
