In the case of Sputnik I can, for once, be pretty precise. The idea crashed into my car on the Formby Bypass, just after the Tesco traffic lights. My daughter was in the car, I said, “What about this – a boy answers the door to a stranger. The stranger comes in and the parents are really welcoming but odd. They keep telling the stranger he’s a clever boy or a pretty boy.

The only relationship I’ve had with a dog was in my late teens when I was a Punch an Judy man. The puppets and booth were made by my hero English teacher Mr Biggs. We had a “Toby Dog” – a dog in a ruff that took a hat round to collect the money. He used to sit up and beg in a very endearing manner. Until someone mugged him in George over Sands. The dog had a nervous breakdown and would beg no more…</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Cottrell Boyce</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"923dd94dde5028b228d26e4e81c16f7d21be04be\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/923dd94dde5028b228d26e4e81c16f7d21be04be/0_0_3508_1318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Lenton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"376\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steven Lenton had the difficult job of drawing Sputnik both as a dog and in his “human” form. <br>Steven says: “Once the alien version of Sputnik was complete translating this into the various canine iterations of the character came fairly easily. Because each human character sees him as a different breed this meant I didn’t have to worry too much about the dimensions of each dog and could instead focus mainly on their poses and expressions.”</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Steve Lenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"964c020262cffca5113098d04bb50bc4621c0076\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/964c020262cffca5113098d04bb50bc4621c0076/0_0_1000_1339/747.jpg\" alt=\"The Coo Palace\" width=\"747\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Coo Palace (Corseyard Model Dairy) is a massive gothic cow shed on a beach near Kirkcudbright.

When it was pointed out that it was MILES from everything, everyone I know and love, I said, “not by boat it wouldn’t be.” This convinced no one. <br> <br>The nearest I could get to owning it was by putting it in a book, so you’ll see more of Coo Palace in Sputnik’s Guide to Life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Cottrell Boyce</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"427c04a20d9d54c79f82683438b5dfacdddd48fe\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/427c04a20d9d54c79f82683438b5dfacdddd48fe/0_0_1000_1339/747.jpg\" alt=\"Esther\" width=\"747\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contrast is always good so I thought the hero should be very quiet. I immediately thought of my niece Esther who is utterly charming and very capable but never utters a word in company. I’ve always been fascinated by people’s reaction to her. They are constantly trying to get her to talk. She’s a puzzle they feel they have to solve. By saying nothing she ends up dominating the conversation. That’s the power of quietness!

But does she want to be found?’</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Robyn is the eldest daughter of the UK Prime Minister. Paparazzi are desperate to get a story on her all day, every day. Now they have the biggest story about Robyn that they ever could have hoped for – Robyn has been kidnapped by a group of terrorists trying to get another terrorist released from prison in exchange for Robyn. But maybe Robyn doesn’t want to be saved, maybe she’s against her father’s beliefs too. Maybe she’s on her kidnappers’ side…</p> <p>When I read the blurb of this book I was instantly draw in and desperate to find out what happened next. I wanted to know all about Robyn and her views and opinions, I wanted to know what her personality was. So when I got the book I was so excited and started reading it as soon as possible, although it was a lot shorter than I expected. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b277f7a5d39e5066881d1755381025573b41da6f\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b277f7a5d39e5066881d1755381025573b41da6f/0_0_312_475/312.jpg\" alt=\"Captive \" width=\"312\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I read this book really fast – firstly because it’s so short and secondly because I was really interested to know what was going to happen next – at the start of the book I was on the edge of my seat, it was so action packed and it was so thrilling. As the story continued however, it started to drag a bit and get a little bit less interesting. Close to the end it got action packed and thrilling again but the whole middle section (for me) had been really frustrating. Although Robyn was a unique and interesting character, I found myself really angry with her because I felt that she was being really stupid and behaving really irrationally. It was really unrealistic and it really annoyed me. </p> <p>Throughout the book there is an ongoing event that is in question and you’re not really supposed to properly know what happened or why it happened and as the book goes on you learn little by little the true story about that event and there were some moments when I was really shocked and surprised by the truth of the event – you know when you’re reading a book and then something that you weren’t expecting happens and you’re like <em>Oh my god! I did not see that coming! </em>There were some moments that were like that!</p> <p>I think Captive<em> </em>was a good and engaging book, but firstly, I think the book needed to be a bit longer and secondly, by the time you reached the end of the book I found myself thinking <em>What was the point in that book?</em> I mean, I know the point of books are to entertain you but I feel like most book have actual meanings as well; they educate you or they inspire you, they make you set a new goal in life or they make you aware of a real issue in life through using fiction. Another thing books do is let you live in a completely different world for a while but when I finish the book or the series I like to come out of the world and feel as though it’s developed me in some way, it’s changed me in some way or taught me a really important life lesson that only that book could have taught me and I felt as though although this book was enjoyable and I was compelled to keep reading, ultimately it was a bit of a pointless story. Bby the end of the book nothing changed, all the characters were basically in the exact same position as the position they were in when the book started. </p> <p>3/5 stars. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/captive-6.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you’ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"<strong>ABitCrazy: </strong>‘you know when you’re reading a book and then something that you weren’t expecting happens and you’re like <em>Oh my god!

subject","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p><strong>The Dogs</strong><br /></p> <p>My most cherished photographs<br />transformed overnight into those of dogs:<br />big horny dogs in their ripest years<br />hogging the frame for themselves.</p> <p>Every last photographer’s trick employed<br />so that even in the tacky studio where he couldn’t focus<br />my dog, like a good dog, looks ever curious and propositional<br />baring his hunk of incisor at us, its nourished decay.</p> <p>In the more rough-cut alfresco shots with an arty contrast<br />between negative and positive textures, my black dog<br />merges with the dark or slides into a pond in such a way<br />that dog and pond are seamless.</p> <p>In this dog world one ear of my dog is serendipitously<br />folded back forever, fixed there,<br />and though the tawny insides appear knobby and esoteric<br />they indicate a constant alertness to any thrown ball</p> <p>or that he is newly ruffled from rolling in the buzzing grass.<br />There is a choice photo stashed in my wallet,<br />its creased folds powdery with friction; his profile<br />is divine against a backdrop of swirling marble blue.</p> <p>This day I recall for its stressful hilarity; we could not bundle<br />his legs onto the stool. Since then the dog has been as mute<br />as the pictures. Perhaps somewhere<br />in his cropped-out lower throat, his bark is stuck.</p> <p><br />Sam Buchan-Watts, whose pamphlet is No 15 in the latest quartet of <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/blog/and-the-2015-16-faber-new-poets-are/\">Faber New Poets</a>, is a sceptical, serious, versatile writer, alert to the uses of <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/poet%E2%80%99s-glossary-elliptical-poetry\">ellipticism</a>. He experiments with prose-poem narratives: his sometimes teasing diction and detailed imagery suggest he has taken lessons in technique from senior virtuosi like John Ashbery. The Dogs is among his most accessible poems, cast in that popular but tricky sub-genre, the photo poem. But Buchan-Watts clearly knows the risks, and he meets the challenge with some elegant foot-work.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p> Ambiguity begins with the speaker’s first assertion. Does it mean that some original (“most cherished”) photos of people underwent a magical realist metamorphosis and “transformed overnight into those of dogs…” – or have the photos of the dogs simply become the speaker’s favourites? Are the dogs symbols and/or shadows of human selves? Do we trust this narrator’s vision? Do we trust our own? </p> <p> We’re alerted early on to the absence of cute puppy snaps, to the status of these “big horny dogs in their ripest years… ” They are self-confident, residually or actively sexual, and greedy, as we’re told by the verb “hogging” in “hogging the frame”. Each probably thinks he owns his small “dog world”.</p> <p> The dog in stanza two is the familiar, grinning, people-pleasing Fido, a dog behaving “like a good dog” though under duress, tricked exhaustively by the photographer into submission. The speaker wants us to sympathise with the dog, who has difficulty focusing in the unnatural light of a “tacky studio”. Yet, for a moment, we wonder if it’s the photographer who has difficulty focusing on the dog. Some shifty grammar and an absence of end-of-line punctuation until the last line make things a little floaty. When the tooth that the dog unagressively displays reveals the “nourished decay” of the over-pampered, the syntax might just suggest that the humans themselves (“us”) represent the rot: “… baring his hunk of incisor at us, its nourished decay”.</p> <p> Buchan-Watts is an accomplished phrase-maker. He skips the dull (if useful) workshop advice about adjectives and adverbs. He knows exactly how to make those lazy parts of speech shape up and pull their weight. Some of the adjective pairings are brilliant. The combination of a not-uncommon dog descriptor, “curious”, for instance, with the less familiar, but unforgettably good “propositional” is strikingly effective. It’s a reminder of the intelligence that co-exists with and sharpens creaturely instinct.</p> <p> Then there’s the coupling of “knobby and esoteric” (line 15) to evoke the view inside the dog’s ear, “serendipitously / folded back forever...” The fact that “esoteric” is itself an esoteric choice seems appropriate to the mysteries of both canine and poetic hearing: “serendipitously” has a similar, aestheticising function. The “knobby” organic complexity is realised in that nice, real-life observation, the “constant alertness to any thrown ball”. Line 17 describes another keen moment of dog joy. Whatever delicious, fly-riddled mess he has rolled in, it’s still alive and “buzzing” in his ear, even as the shades of art’s prison house close around him. </p> <p> The diction reinforces the staginess of the actual “alfresco” shots. That “seamless” disappearance of the dog into his black background of pond or sky is all the more sinister for its aesthetic plottedness. There’s a similar tone in stanza five. Under the carefully noticed, “distressed” surface of the print (“its creased folds powdery with friction” is a fine observation) the dog’s profile is “divine against a backdrop of swirling marble blue”. Marble as an adjective could suggest a swathe of marbled fabric, or recall the colour and patterning of a child’s marble. It also evokes marble statuary, and fits the notion of the “divine”. Of course, divine could be an intensified, hyperbolic form of beautiful. But what if the speaker is serious? It’s not reassuring. </p> <p> The narrator’s empathy is often shown to be insecure: there’s a suspicion that the stiller, less dog-like the dog, the better. (Parents sometimes feel the same about their children). The yoking of “stressful” with “hilarity” is particularly revealing. This last photo is a reminder of the day when “we” struggled to force a quadruped to stand on a too-small stool. It was funny but traumatic, as the consequences reveal. Photography used to be thought capable of stealing the soul. In this case, it’s the photographic technique of <a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/basics-of-photo-cropping-that-you-should-understand/\">cropping</a> that has captured the dog’s essence, his bark. He has since become “as mute / as the pictures”. The image of the “cropped out lower throat” is almost horrifying: it evokes a mortal wounding. And here the stash of photographs runs out.</p> <p> The poem’s quatrain structure is well-matched to theme. It offers up its pictorial stanzas like proudly shown but worrying photos. Stanzas, too, are devices for framing the resistant, and taming life into almost lifelike art. Because the lines are often unexpectedly long, they give an impression of energy trying to defy constraint, of pictures whose narratives might have been cropped in a different sense.</p> <p> With light self-mockery and a bracing lack of sentimentality, the poem hints that the “man’s best friend” relationship, however jolly, is potentially that of slave and master. More significantly, it tells us that these particular dogs have been magicked into artefact, fixed by desires for possession, stasis, beauty. Literature, we might infer, is no less guilty than photography, and dogs not the only victims of objectification. The poem’s biggest question addresses the moral responsibilities of art, not of dog ownership.</p> <p> At the same time, the dogs in the poem are never less than strong, engaging presences: they may have been framed, but they hog their frames, and own their private realities. This makes me think of Marianne Moore’s famous pronouncement, that “<a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/poetry\">poems are imaginary gardens with real toads in them</a>”. Refresh the metaphor: Sam Buchan-Watts gets real dogs into his garden of ideas. Mind out, toads! In other words, this poem is as alive as it is cleverly made. </p> <ul> <li>Faber New Poets #15 by Sam Buchan-Watts is published by Faber &amp; Faber, on 7 April, priced £5. <a

Each sunrise illuminates us with light carrying the energy on which life relies. As the sun rises overhead, each square metre of the Earth’s surface is bombarded by 100bn photons every second – and each second, the photons arriving on that small patch of ground deliver 1,000 joules of energy.

This image shows the sun glowing with x-rays, a type of radiation that is absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere. The sun emits light at all wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, so the view from above the atmosphere is the only way to monitor the sun in all its glory. Space telescopes have become central to our ability to study the sun. They have revealed that the sun is a constantly evolving mass of plasma and tangled magnetic fields which is wracked by the most energetic explosions in the solar system</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Jaxa / National Astronomical Observatory of Japan / University of Tokyo / LMSAL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f2f01cbedc5a0f36bf23f54afce88694ff2ced1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5f2f01cbedc5a0f36bf23f54afce88694ff2ced1/0_231_4096_3697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extreme ultraviolet image of the Sun showing a solar flare on the left side\" width=\"1000\" height=\"903\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Our sun is a magnetic object. The discovery of its magnetic field in 1908 marked the first time any such field had been detected beyond the Earth. It was a moment that changed our understanding of the sun. The magnetic field is the reason the sun has dark spots on its visible surface and an atmosphere at a temperature of about 1m°C (1.8m°F).

The first clue came from comets. As they approach the sun, comets release gas and dust in two tails which always point away from the sun. The dust tail is pushed outwards by the pressure of sunlight falling on the tiny particles, while the gas tail becomes electrically charged and is pushed outwards by the constant expansion of the sun’s atmosphere. Space probes have shown this atmosphere rushes out from the sun at high speeds, in a flow of charged particles known as the solar wind</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESO / E Slawik</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62edb584648cbadd2e3355500dc4fb5480f9a1ab\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/62edb584648cbadd2e3355500dc4fb5480f9a1ab/0_42_1177_1248/943.jpg\" alt=\"A wireless operator typing a telegram\" width=\"943\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 2 September 1859, as stunning auroras lit up the skies, electric telegraph systems all over the world failed.

We monitor the sun’s violent side using occulting disks which allow us to study the regions above the visible surface, marked here by the white circle. A coronal mass ejection on a collision course with the Earth sets space weather forecasters around the world springing into action to predict the likely consequences.

Just as well, because it’s jarring to find yourself in love with a world that doesn’t love you back","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first real book I ever read was Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind. I read it simply because, in the stubborn way of a 12-year-old, I wanted to read the longest book in the library. It was kind of the librarian to point me towards Mitchell rather than Tolstoy, because I found myself in Scarlett O’Hara in a way I didn’t even realise was possible in literature. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/02/100-best-novels-no-76-on-the-road-jack-kerouac\">The 100 best novels: No 76 – On the Road by Jack Kerouac (1957)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was too young to understand some of the more controversial nuances of the representations of slavery, and I probably missed a lot of the political and historical critique, but I was not too young to know that Scarlett was a literary character of rarity. I was used to reading Baby-Sitters Club and the Star Wars expanded universe; this sort of character depth was breathtaking. A smart, ruthless, ambitious and passionate woman, who loved men but didn’t need them? I was in heaven. I felt that Mitchell knew me, knew us as women, knew our weaknesses and our strengths and our hard and soft places and wrote them for us to celebrate ourselves in.</p> <p>The next time I fell in love with a book, it was for the work itself. I was 16 when I read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/02/100-best-novels-no-76-on-the-road-jack-kerouac\">On the Road</a>. I fell for the words. The images. The energy in them. Kerouac wrote the text in three weeks, on a continuous reel of paper, single-spaced to save time. That energy is in the text – it grabs you and drags you along with it. You want to taste it, it’s so visceral. </p> <p>I read more Kerouac, The Dharma Bums my favourite, and then I read Cassady and Ginsberg and Burroughs. I loved the beat generation and the men in it. I loved how they shared themselves with each other and their readers, generously. But I always had, and still have, the sneaking and sinking suspicion that there would have been no place for me in that world. There were no Scarlett O’Haras in the beat world. There were women, certainly, but they felt like cardboard cut-outs, something to move around, admire, shift gently out of the way when necessary. In fact, the only women Kerouac and Ginsberg seemed to genuinely respect were their mothers. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only women Kerouac and Ginsberg seemed to genuinely respect were their mothers</p> <footer> <cite>Lynnette Lounsbury</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I looked. I looked hard. I read female beat writers Carolyn Cassady, Edie Parker and Hettie Jones and they felt more like watchers than participants; muses perhaps, facilitators maybe, but not respected equals. These talented women, some of whom wrote incredible and revolutionary prose, were “the wives”, barely acknowledged by their male peers. They wrote about their identities in relation to the men around them and I wanted more than that – I wanted to read them as writers. And I wanted them to write women. I found the beat women as outsiders in offside compendiums, as afterthoughts and even instigators, but rarely as the orchestrators and creators of their own place in literature. </p> <p>It is quite a conflicted place to be – looking into a world you love and realising there isn’t really any space for you in it. It’s hard to be content in a place where you sense you aren’t respected, liked or loved. As a writer, I solved my dilemma by writing my own beatnik fiction, <a href=\"http://inkermanandblunt.com/home/projects/we-ate-the-road-like-vultures/\">We Ate the Road Like Vultures</a>, and writing myself into the world. I realise that Kerouac may well have been indifferent to my writing, but I have had to make my peace with that – and I’ve inserted myself in a way that works for me, with a female character that embodies the devil-may-care attitude of the beat way but with that unique and innate wildness that women have. My beatnik O’Hara. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/the-best-novels-written-in-english-help-us-come-up-with-a-more-diverse-list\">The best novels written in English: help us come up with a more diverse list</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I imagine it isn’t as easy for readers who aren’t writers. The Guardian’s own list of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels\">100 greatest English language novels of all time</a> had a mere 21 written by women. How many had strong female characters? How many had lead characters of colour? Or with a disability? Or who identified as anything other than cisgender and straight? </p> <p> The literary world has evolved to be more inclusive – both in terms of the writers and the characters – but it is completely possible to fall in love with a world in which you cannot find a place for yourself? It is jarring to find yourself in love with a world that doesn’t seem to love you back, and this can be discouraging to readers and writers alike. Every reader deserves to find themselves in fascinating and difficult characters in genres they identify with. Reading should be pleasurable as well as challenging, immersive, not just standing outside a window looking in. </p> <ul> <li><em>Lynnette Lounsbury’s novel <a href=\"http://inkermanandblunt.com/home/projects/we-ate-the-road-like-vultures/\">We Ate the Road Like Vultures</a> is out now through Inkerman &amp; Blunt</em><br /></li> </ul>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t3qh","wordcount":"799","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/159195f8e04bdeec9a5bf67bd3cf7880722f5cb9/0_313_4365_2620/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>The literary world has become more gender-inclusive since the beats of the 1950s.

Whether you are in a city or the country it is so obvious that everything is changing. The trees are getting greener, birds are singing and carrying twigs for nest-building and, in the countryside at least, every patch of water is full of frog and toad spawn. The first step is to get your children to start looking for themselves and encouraging them to notice the changes and to record what they are seeing. With everyday getting longer and warmer, nothing stays the same for long!<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"98082ed29d3042728671f51594406fa0ed6755b5\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/98082ed29d3042728671f51594406fa0ed6755b5/58_0_286_400/286.jpg\" alt=\"seed\" width=\"286\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are some good books for introducing the basic principles of how nature works. Eric Carle’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/tiny-seed.html\">The Tiny Seed</a> is a beautifully simple introduction to the life cycle of a seed for any age group. It’s the story of one seed, and describes all the dangers that surround it, from people stepping on it to birds eating it. It also shows how important the right weather is for making the seed grow strong and how, when the seed grows, it produces a new plant which, in turn, produces more seeds. </p> <p>In Lucy Cousins’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/maisy-grows-a-garden.html\">Maisy Grows a Garden</a> lovely flowers and vegetables can be made to grow just by pulling tabs and lifting flaps! But there is a lot of information packed in too as it is one of Maisy’s First Science series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d49cb44e0330f0c86e8107e7a731aea263c4d809\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d49cb44e0330f0c86e8107e7a731aea263c4d809/0_0_318_328/318.jpg\" alt=\"little guide\" width=\"318\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-guide-to-trees.html\">A Little Guide to Trees</a> Charlotte Voake looks at growing on a bigger scale. Her delicate illustrations provide a useful way to identify different trees, including oaks, hollies and beech trees which may be found in cities as well as in the country. The book also includes a tree scrap book for readers to fill in and keep.</p> <p>Just looking may not be enough; many children will love getting more closely involved and growing their own plants will be the ideal way of helping them understand nature better. Ley Honor Roberts’s <a href=\"https://www.edenproject.com/shop/My-First-Flower-Garden-10344.aspx\">My First Flower Garden</a> is an excellent practical introduction to growing beautiful flowers. Sowing seeds, planting out seedlings, dealing with garden pests such as slugs which might damage the flowers – all is simply explained with easy to follow instructions. Suggested first flowers to grow include sunflowers which can shoot up so impressively tall and sweet peas which always smell so nice. </p> <p>Sarah Garland’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/eddie-s-garden.html\">Eddie’s Garden: And How to Make Things Grow</a> is a wonderful story about a small boy and the garden he creates. But it is also more than just a story as it is full of facts about all the things that have helped to make Eddie’s garden grow. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2014/apr/13/guide-to-spring-in-pictures-childrens-book\">A guide to spring - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gardens are not just about growing plants. Mike Dilger’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/391420/\">Wildlife in Your Garden</a> is an excellent introduction to all the wildlife that can be found in a garden. Follow the cheeky hedgehog in the pictures to find out all about the butterflies, wasps and bees, foxes, rabbits, frogs and beetles that might be living in any garden. And there is a special focus on the very many kinds of birds which visit gardens as winter visitors as well as the ones who are around all year round, providing an invaluable guide to bird spotting near to home. Sarah Horne’s vivid illustrations help to bring the photographic backgrounds of this fact-packed book to life.</p> <p>Don’t miss Nicola Davies’ gorgeous, poetic, scrapbook style <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/first-book-of-nature.html\">First Book of Nature</a>, with beautiful illustrations by Mark Hearld.

A wittily told conservation story, it tells of a badger called Pete who likes everything neat. Pete lives in the forest and spends all of his time tidying up. First he picks up all the leaves then, to stop more falling, he cuts down all the trees. When that creates a flood and a lot of mud, Pete concretes everything over. But how will he ever get back to his home underground? Luckily, Pete understands what a disaster his tidying has been. He soon puts everything back and learns to love his forest home for what it is. Children who are beginning to take an interest in nature will be delighted by this brilliant picture book and will be influenced by its powerful and wittily conveyed message.</p> <p><strong>Share your favourite books on nature with us.

Read him and you become convinced that western democracies have set themselves problems they no longer have the will to solve.</p> <p>Democracy’s superiority to dictatorship is not that democratic leaders are necessarily more virtuous than dictators are. Nor can anyone but a cockeyed optimist believe that democratic publics are by definition always clever and benevolent. Democracies’ great advantage is meant to be that they have a rubbish chute. When leaders and policies fail, we shove them through it and replace them with something better.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/24/1percent-pay-tax-rate-80percent\">Why the 1% should pay tax at 80% | Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Piketty’s work from the last decade​, collected in <em>Chronicles: On Our Troubled Times</em>,​ throws into doubt democracy’s redeeming and most essential quality: the ability to acknowledge mistakes and reform.</p> <p>He will be remembered, of course, for his masterpiece, <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>, which among its many virtues explained in encyclopedic detail why the need for reform was urgent. The limited equality of the mid-20th century was an aberration, Piketty demonstrated to the satisfaction of all except the wilfully blind. It was the product of progressive taxation and, somewhat less cosily, the destruction of the fortunes of the wealthy brought about​ by revolution and world wars. We are now living in a new gilded age. Not only do the children of the rich have the same advantages they possessed in the 19th century, but, in a modern twist, a new but equally undeserving class of “super managers” extract opulent “rewards” from their companies, which bear no discernible relationship to their less-than-super productivity or performance.</p> <p><em>Capital</em> created something close to hysteria among conservatives. The economics editor of the <em>Financial Times</em> turned from a sober correspondent of an apparently serious newspaper into <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e1f343ca-e281-11e3-89fd-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz43pGKd9VD\" title=\"\">a flaming troll</a>. He found a misprint here, a mistake there, as anyone could find in a book of almost 600 pages packed with data. He and his fellow conservatives added them up, made howlers of their own and concluded that far from being an oligarchy in the making, the rich had suffered calamitous falls in their income.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7738bd75e52b32f38a963640267a8e0d738d6732\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7738bd75e52b32f38a963640267a8e0d738d6732/610_0_2818_3522/800.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Piketty at King’s College, London, in 2014.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Piketty speaks to students at King’s College, London, during a promotional tour for Capital in April 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one believed them. I doubt if they believed themselves. You only had to see what was in front of your nose to know that Piketty was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/may/29/piketty-chris-giles-and-wealth-inequality-its-all-about-the-discontinuities\" title=\"\">describing the world as it is</a>. Conservatives’ ideological motives were as easy to discern. Piketty showed a future where their received wisdom would be little more than pious falsehoods. Unearned wealth would trump individual effort. If you did what politicians told you to do, and “worked hard and played by the rules”, the odds of you matching the unearned wealth of a plutocrat’s child would remain so vast as to be close to incalculable. Speaking of trumping, the super-rich would have the funds to buy rightwing political leaders, or in the case of Donald Trump become leaders themselves. The ease with which they can be bought is already before us, as Piketty’s analysis predicted. You see it in the willingness of conservatives in the US, Britain and France to reinforce the drive to oligarchy by cutting or abolishing inheritance taxes.</p> <p>It is easy to forget that the banking collapse and bailout of the most vulturous and inept “super managers” in the world provoked a crisis of legitimacy for free market conservatism. I hope I am not making a cheap point when I say that the next crisis will reveal that many conservative thinkers and politicians have shamed themselves by doubling down on a failed ideology.</p> <p><em>Chronicles</em> is not a successor to <em>Capital</em> but a slim collection of Piketty’s pieces from the French press. Beyond the pleasure of hearing his thoughts, there is a dismal fascination in watching his instant response to events, and then realising that so many of his sensible proposals got nowhere.</p> <p>Writing at the height of the banking crisis in 2008, Piketty deemed three reforms necessary: shareholders and managers bailed out by the public must pay a price. Financial regulators must stop toxic assets being sold in markets with the same aggression their colleagues apply to dangerous foods and medical treatments. (“This will never be possible” while we leave $10tn of assets in tax havens.) And we must end “the obscene compensation packages of the financial sector which helped stimulate risk taking”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Piketty’s solution, that the eurozone countries share their debts and become a single state, strikes me as naive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eight years on, how’s that all going? Although the authorities did not seize the assets of the managers of Northern Rock and the Royal Bank of Scotland, they have now imposed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/23/jailed-libor-trader-tom-hayes-must-pay-878000-pounds\" title=\"\">criminal penalties and confiscation orders</a> for the bonuses of bankers involved in new scandals. Nothing has been done to eradicate tax havens, however, even though Luxembourg, Monaco and Liechtenstein are in the EU and Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, Gibraltar, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Bermuda, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Cayman Islands are British overseas territories and crown dependencies. As for “obscene compensation packages”, they remain as much an affront to rational evaluations of alleged super managers’ performance as ever.</p> <p>Piketty is as concerned about the crisis in the eurozone as the crisis in global capitalism. He makes a fine point I have never seen argued before, that the idea for the single currency came from the holiday from history of the 1990s. The Berlin Wall was down, the Washington consensus was triumphant, and the wishful thinkers behind the euro assumed that the sole task of the central bank was to control inflation. If they realised they would have to stabilise markets, avoid cascading bankruptcies and print money to subsidise governments, surely they would never have embarked on the folly of creating a single currency before they had a single country. You can make the same argument about the open borders brought by the Schengen Convention of 1990. It was also signed in the post-communist euphoria, when no one thought of the coming dangers of Islamists travelling across the continent through unmanned border posts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/03/sign-up-to-our-bookmarks-email\">Sign up to our Bookmarks newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Piketty’s rational solution that the eurozone countries share their debts and become a single state strikes me as naive in the extreme. With uncharacteristic blindness he underestimates the unwillingness of the peoples of Europe to dissolve their national identities. Like the most wide-eyed euro enthusiast of the 90s, he assumes that a new European state can be ordered into existence with a revolution from above.</p> <p>Perhaps I am being too harsh. For all the rightwing attacks on him, and the claims by his admirers that he is the successor to Karl Marx, Piketty is anything but a revolutionary. His aims are modest. He wants a eurozone that isn’t a basket case, and a society that does not fix its rules to suit the trustafarian slob and the executive rent-seeker.</p> <p>Is that too much to ask? Apparently in western societies it is. Necessary reform is now a utopian dream. We can barely contemplate it, let alone implement it.</p> <p><em>Chronicles: On Our Troubled Times is published by Viking (£20). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385675/s/chronicles-on-our-troubled-times/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for £16 </em></a></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4hp7y","wordcount":"1154","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/d6c9dc1e48348d6a340547fda43e2e89f3f903b8/0_204_3987_2393/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-25T06:15:00Z","standfirst":"Eight years on from the banking crisis, Thomas Piketty’s calls for financial reform are still ignored.

and to return safely. In an extract from his book, he describes what he saw in Raqqa and Mosul, and the chilling moment he realised that his angry, masked driver was one of the world’s most-wanted men","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<h2><strong>Sunday 7 December 2014</strong></h2> <p>Abu Qatadah, a German-born Muslim convert, who has brokered our visit to the Islamic State, is almost as wide as he is tall, with a thick, reddish-brown beard. My photographer son Frederic and I load our bags into the bed of the white pickup Qatadah and his driver arrived in. The driver’s head and face are so thoroughly wrapped with a large grey shawl that only his eyes and the contours of his nose are visible. He murmurs a greeting in English in a strikingly rhythmic accent. For security reasons, we can’t use the main roads. The drive to Raqqa takes more than three hours.</p> <p>Qatadah claims business is booming in Isis. Almost all the shops are open and lots of goods are being sold, above all at the markets. We notice the new construction. “In places that are not being bombed, life goes on as normal,” Qatadah tells us. Then he gives us a short lecture on Isis’s version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/sharia-law\">sharia</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73276d37c0f84cd2aab9e7e506c49883bd7d95bc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/73276d37c0f84cd2aab9e7e506c49883bd7d95bc/0_0_1400_1050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Business was booming in Isis, above all at the markets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Business was booming in Isis, above all at the markets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Frederic Todenhöfer 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For theft of goods worth more than $40 (£28), a hand is cut off. $40 is the price of a gram of gold.</p> <p>Christians have to pay <em>jizya</em>, a protection tax. It comes to about $300 (£210) a year for poor people and $600 (£420) for the rich. But then that is the only tax. Christians are among the more prosperous inhabitants of the country. All they have to do is sell a couple of sheep to raise the money to cover the tax.</p> <p>Muslims pay a <em>zakat</em>, or religious tax, based on their assets. Rich Muslims pay more tax than Christians. Poor ones pay less. The money is used for social programmes. In Raqqa, for example, Isis runs three hospitals.</p> <p>At the moment, Isis finances itself mostly through assets seized in war, sales of oil and the zakat. In reality, Qatadah claims, there are no slave markets the way we imagine them. Slaves are part of the spoils of war and therefore either go to the fighters or are sold. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/who-yazidi-isis-iraq-religion-ethnicity-mountains\">Yazidi</a> woman is worth about $1,500 (£1,050) at the moment.

We drive by a circular plaza we recognise from media reports. It’s surrounded by an iron fence. This is where the heads of decapitated enemies are impaled and put on display. I had imagined the eerie plaza to be much larger. Frederic is not allowed to take any photographs – the decision of the masked driver, who evidently has a lot of say.</p> <p>Frederic asks what they did with the bodies of the hostages they killed; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/james-foley\">James Foley</a> and all the others. “They were buried individually, or rather, tossed into the ground. Somewhere,” Qatadah answers impassively.</p> <p>Tomorrow we’re supposed to be going to Mosul. Because our iPhones have built-in GPS systems that cannot be disabled, they would pose a security risk. Therefore, the phones are going to stay here. We won’t be able to retrieve them until we leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"986666eb2ed78ba049d350aabc01eb3e04aa301c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/986666eb2ed78ba049d350aabc01eb3e04aa301c/306_18_826_1032/800.jpg\" alt=\"A 15-year-old Isis policeman. ‘We are here to help.’\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 15-year-old Isis policeman. ‘We are here to help.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Frederic Todenhöfer 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Qatadah explains that, at the end of our journey, all our video and photo files will be reviewed. That’s normal procedure in war.</p> <p>We look grim. That was not what we agreed to. We try to negotiate a compromise. But our driver, still completely disguised – and who clearly has more authority than we first realised – repeats the requirement emphatically, and with stinging coldness. Then, jutting his head forward, he looks us in the eye and asks if we finally understand. His right eyelid seems to droop a little.</p> <p>An icy silence fills the room. The tone and atmosphere have suddenly changed. Qatadah seems to find the whole situation rather uncomfortable.</p> <h2><strong>Monday 8 December 2014 </strong></h2> <p>Our request to report freely without any censorship has been categorically denied by Qatadah’s superiors. The security risk is too high. A drone only needs a single photograph of an individual to be able to target that person and kill him.</p> <p>Qatadah tells us we’re no longer allowed to go out and about in Raqqa. We have to stay in the apartment until we leave for Mosul. I ask if before we leave we can at least see the British hostage, the journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/03/syria-islamists-capture-john-cantile\">John Cantlie</a>, or the famous executioner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/26/uk-man-behind-isis-beheadings-named-as-mohammed-emwazi-jihadi-john\">Jihadi John</a>. Qatadah’s answer is a resounding “no”.</p> <p>Abu Loth – a wiry fighter who looks about 25, also German, with Moroccan roots – appears along with our English “driver”, whose face is still hidden. The driver immediately takes charge of the conversation. Basically, he doesn’t trust journalists, and if we don’t want to accept that, then we can go. “Do you think it’s smart to let somebody come, someone you don’t know, to invite him to your state, the state everybody is fighting against? And then you don’t control him?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f41228bad152bee97879167bd2649b005721cad\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4f41228bad152bee97879167bd2649b005721cad/0_0_1480_1110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"History was written in the Great Mosque of al-Nuri.

On this trip, he’ll show us a couple of things we want to see. If we prove ourselves to be trustworthy, we are welcome to come back and visit another time. Then all restrictions would be lifted. As it is, we have already achieved a great deal and can count ourselves lucky. We are the first non-Muslim journalists to come here without having our heads cut off.</p> <p>Why are we so interested in this “Jihadi John, as you call him”, and Cantlie, the masked one wants to know. Why aren’t we interested in Muslims who are suffering in this country?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Is it smart to let someone you don’t know into the state everybody is fighting against? And then not control him?</p> <footer> <cite>Masked driver</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite his protestations, the theme of Cantlie seems to interest him. He leaves to speak with his superiors again to find out if we might be able to visit Raqqa after all, and whether a meeting with Cantlie might be possible, even without cameras. Our visit has been arranged by the central media department and by the caliph’s office. So no one wants to take any chances.</p> <p>When Qatadah and the driver return, both look extremely sullen. Have their proposals been rejected? The driver sits down again on the armchair across from me. “Mosul or Turkey. That’s it,” he snaps disagreeably. And he sticks by his original proposal in the matter of Cantlie. I am mystified. He needs to treat us with more respect, I say.</p> <p>The masked man ups the stakes. There will be restrictions in Mosul as well. I tell him calmly that the ban on leaving the apartment is completely unacceptable. Such a thing has never happened to me, not even when I visited the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban\">Taliban</a>. “We aren’t the Taliban,” the masked man snarls. The only part of his face that is visible is that one eye with the half-closed lid. Meanwhile, Frederic is staring at the Englishman with a horrified look on his face.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1daceb61ab22cf60d90c8c9235dd804086079be\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e1daceb61ab22cf60d90c8c9235dd804086079be/311_150_1316_790/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local ‘guards’ follow us wherever we go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local ‘guards’ follow us wherever we go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Frederic Todenhöfer 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I take the invitation from the caliph out of my pocket and say: “You gave us a formal invitation filled with grand words. Instead, you’re treating us like prisoners.”</p> <p>“You are not prisoners,” the masked man yells in his rhythmic accent. “Prisoners don’t get to choose what they want for breakfast.”</p> <p>“Change your tone right now,” I yell so loudly that he jumps.</p> <p>The way he’s looking at us, there’s nothing he’d like better than to cut off our heads.</p> <p>We try to extricate ourselves from this conflict without losing too much face and most importantly to return to a position where we can negotiate. So I tell the Englishman as calmly as I can that we are now going to return to our room to decide whether we wish to drive on to Mosul or turn back.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I’m not absolutely sure, but I think the masked driver is Jihadi John</p> <footer> <cite>Frederic Todenhöfer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we end the journey now, there’s a good chance Isis will change their minds and see a greater advantage in kidnapping or beheading us. That would be no worse loss of face for them than if, on our return, we describe how Isis’s word isn’t worth the paper it’s written on. It’s all too complicated for me. I don’t want to break off the journey because of a breach of etiquette. Apart from that, film and photos are also censored by western states in war zones for security reasons. We decide to continue with the journey, but to insist on changing the tone of our exchanges.</p> <p>After a while, Qatadah comes into our room and asks if he can bring us anything. He obviously wants to smooth things over.</p> <p>When he leaves, Frederic sits down next to me, white as a sheet. He whispers: “I’m not absolutely sure because I can’t check without my computer, but I think the masked Englishman is Jihadi John.”</p> <p>We sit together in silence for a long time, just looking at one another.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday 9 December 2014 </strong></h2> <p>We have travelled in a small minibus to Mosul, in the heart of Isis. Five thousand Isis fighters control this city, which once had a population of two million. Fewer than 400 men were all it took to rout more than two divisions of Iraqi soldiers, 20,000 of them. Qatadah tells us it was only 183 men.</p> <p>Mosul looks normal to us, just like other big cities in the Middle East – vibrant, with lots of traffic and countless people on the street. Did we just drive by an Isis traffic cop? I’m not sure, but that’s what it looked like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a40d28ecfc60ce331b4f1ebc061895b984f9ca6b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a40d28ecfc60ce331b4f1ebc061895b984f9ca6b/0_0_1400_1050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mosul is vibrant, with lots of traffic and countless people on the street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mosul is vibrant, with lots of traffic and countless people on the street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Frederic Todenhöfer 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, as I look around, I don’t forget that countless Shias and Jews have been murdered in this city or driven out, and a zillion Christians have fled. Mosul is now a completely Sunni town. You can’t see the misery of those who were murdered or driven out.</p> <p>We turn off into a side street to meet someone from the media department who is going to explain what will happen next. We’re led through a glass door into a small shop. This is where “Isis Publishing” conducts its business. The books and brochures piled up here will soon be distributed to mosques all over Isis territory. The latest flyers and brochures are laid out in a display case: “How to Handle Your Slaves”, “How to Swear Allegiance to the Caliph”, “How Women Should Behave and Dress”, “How to Look After the Poor”, “How to Be a Good Isis Fighter”.</p> <p>Also on display is the first book officially published by Isis, <a href=\"http://www.irfi.org/articles4/articles_5001_6000/fiqh%20of%20jihad%20-%20part%201html.htm\">Fiqh al Jihad</a> (Understanding Jihad). Qatadah thinks that, if this book were found on me in Germany, I would be sentenced to at least seven years in jail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ebceff73a0d904593b6c15f909c4b7d923ffe15\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7ebceff73a0d904593b6c15f909c4b7d923ffe15/0_99_1520_911/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brochures Isis Publishing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brochures at Isis Publishing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Frederic Todenhöfer 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wednesday 10 December 2014</strong></h2> <p>I suggest we go into one of the small fish restaurants to eat <em>masgouf</em> – carp baked in a clay oven, a speciality from Baghdad. It isn’t exactly the cleanest place in town. But as long as the food tastes good, we don’t mind. There is water and, of course, Pepsi to drink. Everyone likes the fish, which is indescribably crisp on the outside and wonderfully moist on the inside. Except for Qatadah. He orders a different fish, which he doesn’t like very much.</p> <p>When I have to cross a neighbouring room on my way to the toilet, I see our two drivers from Raqqa without their masks sitting with two of our local escorts. I apologise and continue on my way. The strongly curved nose of our driver sticks in my mind. As does his long black hair, which falls down the back of his neck.</p> <p>On the drive back to our bungalow, we notice there is something up with our driver. He’s furious with us again – probably because I saw him without his mask. After we’re parked, he gives Frederic an unfriendly nod and signals that he should follow him. Bent slightly forward in a domineering manner, with his head to one side and his eyelid half closed, the driver stares hard at Frederic: “You will go and get your cameras now, including all your memory cards. You will give them to me. I will look at everything, make a copy for you, and give you your cameras back tomorrow morning. Are we clear?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4929ba69c088a8bec30457d14c08c6e2920ab560\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4929ba69c088a8bec30457d14c08c6e2920ab560/0_0_1624_916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"According to Abu Qatadah, those who do not convert will be killed. ‘150 million, 200 million, 500 million.

We did not agree that Isis would make copies of his material. That is not going to happen under any circumstances.</p> <p>Our driver is on the point of exploding. He is seething with rage.</p> <p>Frederic sees that the situation could escalate at any time and he shrugs his shoulders. Then he gets his cameras and gives them to our poisonous chief driver before he blows up completely.</p> <p>Confused, we go to our bungalow. Just before the entrance, Qatadah and I get into an argument about the behaviour of our driver. Suddenly, Qatadah starts shouting.</p> <p>“We don’t give a shit how you are welcomed and treated in other countries in the Muslim world. They are all just kissing your ass. We will not kiss your ass,” he curses. “You are never satisfied. You are always asking questions. Challenging us the whole time, everything we do. And may I say, you are really pissing off some people here. We will not accept that.” Our Isis minders are a bundle of nerves. We are, too.</p> <p>An even greater distance develops between us and our escorts over the next two days in Mosul, before we return to Raqqa and begin the long wait to cross the border. Finally, on Monday 15 December, we are given our mobile phones back, and left to run in the shadow of an armed Turkish watchtower, across a ploughed field and over the border.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f266f0aea8237d5835a9ab1c406ba2720f952dc\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5f266f0aea8237d5835a9ab1c406ba2720f952dc/92_283_2180_1309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frederic and I in Mosul, looking like locals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frederic and I in Mosul, looking like locals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: © Frederic Todenhöfer 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A couple of days after our return, Frederic gives me a call. “Do you recognise this voice?” he asks. The voice I hear is unclear, but the rhythm of the speech seems familiar – it’s our “driver”. Frederic says: “That is Jihadi John, the executioner.”</p> <p>Later, Frederic plays me the video where Jihadi John threatens to behead two kidnapped Japanese nationals. It’s as though someone has slapped me upside the head. The rhythmic, driving speech pattern, the mostly half-closed eyes, that piercing stare, the body language – exactly the same. Although the voice in the video has been electronically altered by lowering its pitch, for me there’s hardly a shadow of a doubt.</p> <p>Frederic has one more surprise. He has found a YouTube video released by the infamous hacker group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous\">Anonymous</a>, in which Jihad John’s voice has been restored as far as possible to its normal pitch. We can hardly believe how much it sounds like our driver. Recently published photos of Jihadi John show an incredible similarity to the man I saw – albeit briefly – without his disguise. They also match the outline of the masked face that sat across from me in the car for so many days.</p> <p>None of this is 100% proof, and I would never pretend it is. But everything fits together. The way he appeared to have easy access to the journalist Cantlie. His irritation when I refused to take part in the propaganda show with Cantlie. His absurd disguise all day and all night. The way he freaked out when I happened to see him one day without it.</p> <p>We have no doubt Isis will deny everything. After all, Jihadi John is one of the most sought-after terrorists in the world.</p> <p>The next day, Frederic sends Qatadah the Anonymous audio. He asks whether the voice doesn’t remind him of our driver. The terse response comes right away.</p> <p>“No.”</p> <p>“Are you sure?” Frederic asks.</p> <p>“Of course.” Qatadah replies.</p> <p><em>•This is an edited extract from My Journey Into the Heart of Terror: Ten Days in the Islamic State by Jürgen Todenhöfer, published in English by Greystone on 21 April at £17.99</em></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t2qc","wordcount":"2645","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/58c3568f5eb5d55eb80daae787bb0980f8b557ce/119_160_1259_755/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-07T06:15:01Z","standfirst":"<p>The German writer Jürgen Todenhöfer was the first western journalist allowed to enter Isis-controlled Syria and Iraq – and to return safely.

Remarkably, it was not until Charles Darwin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/22/darwinbicentenary.evolution\" title=\"\">published <em>On the Origin of Species </em>in 1859</a> that anyone, in our history, had thought methodically to address the reason for our existence. Darwin’s answer to this simple question was to show that every earthly species – chimps or humans, lizards or fungus – had evolved over about 3bn years by the process known as natural selection.</p> <p>But then, after the furious controversy surrounding that publication, Darwin’s celebrated theory fell into neglect and misuse. A hundred years later, in the heady, innovative atmosphere of the 1960s, a new generation of young and ambitious evolutionary biologists found themselves confronted with a rare opportunity: the rediscovery and renewal of evolutionary theory. Enter Richard Dawkins, a young Oxford zoologist who had been born, and partly raised, in Africa. Following some notable pioneers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/09/guardianobituaries3\" title=\"\">WD Hamilton</a> and GC Williams, Dawkins pulled together many disparate strands of thought about the nature of natural selection, and organised them into a conceptual framework with far-reaching implications for our understanding of Darwin’s ideas. He called it <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, a title he later considered to contain an unconscious echo of Oscar Wilde’s <em>The Selfish Giant</em>. Dawkins was convinced that an amplified and developed version of neo-Darwinism “could make everything about life fall into place, in the heart as well as in the brain”. His book would extol, he wrote, a “gene’s-eye view of evolution”.</p> <p>It was Dawkins’s simple, but profound, proposition that “the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even, strictly, the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity.” He acknowledged that this might sound “at first like an extreme view” but proceeded to explore all the major themes of social theory in the light of this idea, conducting his survey in a highly readable and entertaining way. With chapters such as “Genesmanship”, “Battle of the Sexes”, and “Nice Guys Finish First”, he tackled concepts of altruism and selfishness, the evolution of aggressive behaviour, kinship theory, sex ratio theory, reciprocal altruism, deceit, and the natural selection of sex differences. In hindsight, it seems appropriate that <em>The Selfish Gene</em> should have been published soon after <em>The Joy of Sex</em> and <em>The Female Eunuch</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/05/richard-dawkins-fairytales-not-harmful\">You can call me a big bad wolf but not a bore, says Richard Dawkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From his first page, Dawkins unfolds an exhilarating and combative narrative of the gene’s-eye view of life with infectious brio. <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, he declares, should be read “almost as though it were science fiction. It is designed to appeal to the imagination.” Part of the book’s compulsion derives from Dawkins’s appealing certainty that he is exploring a scientific world in which “we are survival machines – robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes”. This insight, he reports, is “a truth which still fills me with astonishment”.</p> <p>Much of this book’s appeal lies in its author’s barely suppressed excitement, prose that bubbles over with the intoxication of a brilliant new approach. He buttonholes his readers; he dazzles with paradox and provocation. In an introduction to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/31/the-selfish-gene-richard-dawkins-review\" title=\"\">later edition of <em>The Selfish Gene</em></a><em>,</em> Dawkins describes its gestation: it was a book written in extremis (the power cuts and industrial strife of the early 1970s) and, as he says, “in a fever of excitement”. For the young author, it was, in hindsight, “one of those mysterious periods in which new ideas are hovering in the air”.</p> <p>So zeitgeisty was it that, from first publication, the reception of <em>The Selfish Gene </em>was highly favourable. Initially, it was not seen as a controversial book, Dawkins wrote later. “Its reputation for contentiousness took years to grow.” Eventually it would become regarded as a work of extreme radicalism. But, he goes on, “over the very same years as the book’s reputation for extremism has escalated, its actual content has seemed less and less extreme”.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/15/richard-dawkins-interview-appetite-wonder\">Richard Dawkins: 'I don't think I am strident or aggressive'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is undeniable: while <em>The Selfish Gene</em> grew out of orthodox neo-Darwinian ideas, it actually expressed Darwinism in a way that Darwin himself might have welcomed. Rather than focus on the individual organism, it looked at nature from the perspective of the gene. It was, claimed Dawkins, “a different way of seeing, not a different theory”.</p> <p>It also addressed itself to “three imaginary readers”: the generalist, the expert and the student. This was a high-low cohort that swiftly propelled it on to bestseller lists worldwide. Moreover, in keeping with the temper of the times, <em>The Selfish Gene</em> announced itself, from the first, as “a book about animal behaviour”, arguing that “we, like all other animals, are (survival) machines created by our genes”. For Dawkins, “we” did not mean just people. He wanted his description to embrace all animals, plants, bacteria and viruses. “The total number of survival machines on Earth,” he wrote, “is very difficult to count.” Even the total number of species is unknown, he conceded. “Taking just insects alone, the number of individual insects may be a million million million.”</p> <p>Dawkins – in a style that would recur in later polemical books <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/03/richarddawkins\" title=\"\">such as <em>The God Delusion</em></a><em> </em>– was never less than comprehensive in his ambitions. Here, he used “survival machine” rather than “animal” because he wanted to encompass all plants and humans, too. His argument should apply, he said, to any and all “evolved beings”.</p> <p>Orthodox neo-Darwinian he might be, but in chapter 11, he coined an idea about cultural transmission that quickly went viral within the global intellectual community: the meme, or replicator, a unit of imitation. Examples of memes include tunes, idea, catchphrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches: “Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.” Shortly after this analysis, Dawkins characterised “God” as a meme. Thus, pages 192-193 of <em>The Selfish Gene</em> might be said to encapsulate most of Richard Dawkins’s brilliant career, in which the theory of evolution came to offer such a satisfying and complete explanation for the complexity of life on Earth that there could no longer be a place for the possibility of God’s design.</p> <h2>A signature sentence</h2> <p>“A monkey is a machine that preserves genes up trees, a fish is a machine that preserves genes in the water; there is even a small worm that preserves genes in German beer mats.

He first moved out of her bedroom and had the connecting door boarded shut, then formally separated from her, announcing in a newspaper advertisement in June 1858 that “some domestic trouble of mine of long standing” had been resolved.</p> <p>He insisted that the break – the exhibition will include the previously unseen lawyer’s draft of the deed of separation – “involves no anger or ill-will of any kind”, which was far from the truth. The woman he was really desperate to keep out of the public gaze was his much younger mistress, the actress <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/07/ralph-fiennes-invisible-woman-charles-dickens\">Ellen Ternan</a>.</p> <p> The exhibition will open next month at the <a href=\"http://dickensmuseum.com/\">Charles Dickens Museum</a> in London, in the building that was the first house the couple rented together. It will be co-curated by Lillian Nayder, professor of English at Bates College in Maine. Nayder has published a <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100270960\">biography</a> of Catherine, rehabilitating her as a clever, affectionate woman, gifted at music, maintaining a circle of interesting friends after the separation, and devoted to her children despite Dickens characterising her as lacking any real feeling for them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71c8a3118fbb84d0cacc808fb78b765fbc7318f1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/71c8a3118fbb84d0cacc808fb78b765fbc7318f1/0_515_6658_3996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of the Charles Dickens Museum at 48 Doughty Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Interior of the Charles Dickens Museum at 48 Doughty Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siobhan Doran/siobhandoran.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I think there is a recognition that her time has come,” Nayder said. “She has really been the ghost in the house in that museum, virtually written out of the story, even though it was her home too. I think with the first woman director and a woman curator at the museum it is a very different place, and they realise that the story of Catherine must also be acknowledged and told. </p> <p>“Dickens was such a powerful character, and his words carried such weight, that I think most scholars have just accepted it and chosen not to look closer at the real character of Catherine.”</p> <p>Nayder has even had her students try out some of the recipes Catherine published in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/rereading-charles-dickens-dinner\">What Shall We Have for Dinner</a>, which less kind critics have taken as evidence of why she became so stout.</p> <p>“I think the break was a classic mid-life crisis,” she said. “He was remarkably youthful still, and she had had 10 children and several miscarriages. It was a terrible thing. Several of the men in their circle had quietly maintained mistresses, but forcing his wife out of her home was an extraordinary act which Charles then had to do everything to justify in public and maintain his own reputation. She never defended herself, never wrote or said a word against him in public.”</p> <p>When they met, and when they married less than two years later, in their early 20s, Charles was unknown and almost penniless. Catherine’s father, George Hogarth, was a newspaper editor who gave Charles one of his first breaks as a writer, commissioning stories that he wrote under the pen name Boz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f570db11d95409f5e6437cbc707758a24b1415c\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9f570db11d95409f5e6437cbc707758a24b1415c/0_506_4243_2547/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ring that belonged to Catherine Dickens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ring that belonged to Catherine Dickens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Dickens Museum collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The exhibition will be full of poignant reminders of the couple’s halcyon days, including a letter from her younger sister Mary within months of the marriage, describing Catherine as “a most capital housekeeper and as happy as the day is long”. The house at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2012/jan/24/charles-dickens-interiors-in-pictures\">48 Doughty Street</a> was where two of their children were born. Mary died unexpectedly in Dickens’s arms, sending him into a spiral of grief. After the split, Catherine’s sister Georgina stayed with Dickens to the end of his life, looking after the children.</p> <p>The exhibition will also include the portrait and lock of his hair that he gave her on their engagement, with a ring set with turquoises – very like the one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/feb/23/why-charles-dickenss-best-character-is-non-existent\">David Copperfield</a> gives Dora – describing it as “a pretty little toy”. A small gilt coin purse, coming from a member of the Dickens family, is believed to be her wedding gift to him.</p> <p>A group of Catherine’s possessions resurfaced last year on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/28/antiques-roadshow-fa-cup-trophy-valued-at-more-than-1m\">Antiques Roadshow</a> and will be on display, on loan from their private owner, including a ring modelled as a gaping fanged serpent that she bequeathed to Georgina. <br /></p> <p>Nayder does not accept the legend that the hissing serpent was a last symbolic protest against her sister’s behaviour. “I think that’s another of the many myths about Catherine. I believe the twining snake was actually a Victorian symbol of friendship. She remained on good terms with Georgina, truly glad if she had been driven out of her home and could not be there, that Georgina was there almost as her surrogate, taking care of her family.” </p>","productionOffice":"UK","trailText":"Installation at Charles Dickens Museum will overturn accepted narrative to show how wife of Victorian novelist was clever, affectionate and gifted at music","headline":"Life of Catherine Dickens to be celebrated in new exhibition","byline":"Maev Kennedy"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/03/life-of-catherine-charles-dickens-museum-exhibition-london-wife","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/apr/03/life-of-catherine-charles-dickens-museum-exhibition-london-wife","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"fbc1c722791927750055e7ada4e6f758aefaf3e9","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/fbc1c722791927750055e7ada4e6f758aefaf3e9/235_699_3265_1959/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/fbc1c722791927750055e7ada4e6f758aefaf3e9","altText":"Detail from an engraving of Catherine Dickens","caption":"Detail from an engraving of Catherine Dickens.

asked how it began, I would have to say it was when I noticed that 50 Shades of Grey had sold millions of copies without having any recognisable plot. As I sat at my desk in the top London auction house where I worked as an assistant curator, it occurred to me that if I could combine having lots of sex with some action, then I might be on to a winner.</p> <p>After a day in which I had yet again been persecuted for being working class, I was ready for some action. So when I bumped into an old school friend, Leanne, on my way home and she invited me to join her as an escort at the Gstaad Club in the evenings, I had little hesitation in accepting. Cue long digression about how much I like fucking complete strangers.</p> <p>“You’re sacked,” said Rupert, after I had done some independent research into a Stubbs that was to be sold at auction. Could losing the job for which I had strived so hard have anything to do with the fact that I knew it wasn’t a real Stubbs and that Rupert was trying to pull a fast one?</p> <p>There was only one thing for it. Graphic sex. “Come on,” I said to Leanne. “We’re going to Nice with the extremely fat James who pays me £3,000 a night to drink Cristal with him.”</p> <p>That night I changed out of my Miu-Miu and into my Prada before slipping into my Chanel. Pert breasts, split-crotch panties etc. After reluctantly tending to James’ miserable cock, Leanne and I went out to party. “He’ll sleep for days now I’ve spiked his drink with barbiturates,” I said.</p> <p>“Oh dear, he seems to have died,” Leanne said as we returned to the hotel.</p> <p>“Never mind,” I replied. “You fly back to London, I’ll pocket the €10,000 I found in his wallet and nip down to Italy and nobody will be any the wiser.”</p> <p>Portofino was warm, so I bought myself a Dolce &amp; Gabbana bikini and a Versace towel and strolled along the marina. “You look like you’re very rich,” I said to Steve the billionaire, making sure he caught sight of my neatly shaven pussy.</p> <p>“Actually, I’m not that into women,” Steve the billionaire replied. “But why don’t you come and join me for a month or two while we cruise round the Med? There will be plenty of strangers for you to fuck so your narrative flow won’t be interrupted.”</p> <p>After 100 pages of doing nothing much but exposing myself and having anonymous sex that made me very wet etc, I ended up in Rome. There I discovered that Rupert was planning to sell the Stubbs to the mafia for $3m, so I quickly murdered the mafia middle-man and pocketed the lot.</p> <p>“Isn’t it a bit of a stretch to ask readers to believe you’ve become an accomplished international assassin?” asked Leanne.</p> <p>“I have as much contempt for them as I do for you,” I replied, driving my Manolo heel through her temple.</p> <p>Having murdered a couple of other people, I settled down to show how much I knew about art by writing down the first paragraph of the Wikipedia entry on Artemisia Gentileschi.</p> <p>“Let’s go shopping at Inès de la Fressange,” said Renaud, a stunningly attractive man with a happy, smiling cock. “And then I will fuck you in the arse.”</p> <p>“Can we ease up on the botty action?” I replied. “I’m a wee bit sore.”</p> <p>“Fraid not. It’s a must in this kind of book. You’re wanting it, you’re loving it, you’re getting it. By the way, your bum tastes of oysters.”</p> <p>After the most amazing anal sex, glistening hardness etc, I killed Renaud and decapitated him. Only another international assassin sent to kill me would have known my bum tasted of oysters.</p> <p>To be continued. Sadly.</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> 50 shades of exploitation<br /></p>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t28y","wordcount":"677","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/b1a5c11e108e1ca37a5da923fa13323300e12589/317_1493_2894_1735/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-07T23:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>John Crace reduces the yachts and murders art-world bonkbuster to a pert 600 words</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/03/maestra-ls-hilton-digested-read","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/apr/03/maestra-ls-hilton-digested-read","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"b1a5c11e108e1ca37a5da923fa13323300e12589","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/b1a5c11e108e1ca37a5da923fa13323300e12589/0_468_3508_2664/2000.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/b1a5c11e108e1ca37a5da923fa13323300e12589","altText":"Maestra","caption":"Bringing 50 Shades to heel … Maestra.

It is really happening to you","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I haven’t been a full-time film critic since 2011, and in my free time these days I mostly watch Canadian home remodelling shows and listen to audiobooks for 12-year-old girls, so maybe I’m just out of the loop. Did we stop making movies with characters and plots? Has the movie-going public lost their taste for story arcs wherein characters who have earned our investment do interesting, new things that make sense? Has the definition of “movie” changed from “motion picture story that a human wrote on purpose” to “700 only tangentially related 12-second grey and red vignettes”? Because I’ve just come from Batman v Superman, which isn’t a film in any sense that I’m familiar with, but rather 153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together, with character profiles ranging from “depressed statue” to “depressed explosion”.</p> <p>Did someone ask for this? Are we happy with this?</p> <p>We open with Bruce Wayne’s parents dying, AGAIN (oh, do Bruce’s parents die? I hadn’t heard) – several minutes of slow-motion gun porn that could have been used to give Bruce, or anyone in this film, an actual personality, but nah. Bruce runs away from his parents’ funeral and immediately falls in a hole where he is lifted up in the air by a tornado of frenzied, disgusting bats. Then he gets rabies and dies. I wish. (Hey, can somebody please get Bruce some therapy? I’m not sure where “hanging out with Alfred in a basement for 30 years” falls on the spectrum of self-care, but it can’t be good.)</p> <p>What actually happens is that Ben Affleck wakes up, panting, and the bat-nado was all a dream! – a device that will happen nine million more times in this movie. At one point, Affleck wakes up from a dream and realises it was all a dream, <em>and then wakes up from a dream again, because that dream was all a dream too</em>. Batman v Superman, unfortunately, is not a dream. It is really happening to you.</p> <p>Cut to downtown Gotham City, which is apparently just across “the bay” from Metropolis (oh, OK), and is currently being completely douched by the climactic action scene of Man of Steel, B v S’s predecessor. In perhaps the movie’s only interesting conceit, we get to see what Superman’s epic battle with General Zod (or any superheroics on a world-saving scale) would look like to a random human being on the ground: carnage, destruction, death, fire, chaos, rubble and the lamentations of parentless children. Super!</p> <p>As Affleck watches from the street, one of the flying Kryptonians’ naughty laser eyes shears the Wayne Enterprises skyscraper right in half, killing all of his beloved corporate employees instantly. Ugh, Affleck hates that Super guy now! He is going to figure out a way to versus him to death, for sure!</p> <p>Cut to an island somewhere. An old white dude finds some kryptonite. He is never mentioned again.</p> <p>Cut to Africa somewhere. Lois Lane is interviewing a warlord. “They did not tell me the interview was with a lady,” he says.</p> <p>“I’m not a lady, I’m a journalist.” #FEMINISM.</p> <p>Cut to the US Congress, where a committee is considering putting Superman on trial for not saving the world good enough. “The world has been so caught up in what Superman can do,” Holly Hunter says, “we haven’t stopped to ask what he should do.” Nobody seems to notice that those words mean nothing.</p> <p>Cut to Lois Lane’s apartment, where she is taking an erotic bath, because that’s what women are for. Romantically, to prove that he is Superhorny even though Congress is being a total boner-killer, Clark Kent climbs in there with her fully clothed, displacing many gallons of water into their downstairs neighbour’s ceiling. One wonders when director Zack Snyder last had a landlord and a security deposit.</p> <p>Cut to Lex Luthor yelling about something.</p> <p>Cut to Clark pitching a Batman exposé to his editor, Laurence Fishburne. “Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman,” Fishburne scoffs. If only Snyder had read his own script before starting production.</p> <p>Cut to – oh my God. We are only 10 minutes into this movie. Long story short, Batman and Superman fight. Everything explodes. <em>Fin</em>.</p> <p>One of the great beauties of comic books, as a form, is their expansiveness. These stories sprawl over decades, reboots, hundreds of writers, thousands of issues. The cumulative result is a depth of character that you simply can’t achieve in other mediums, even television. Even wildly divergent characterisations feed into that underlying pool of human complexity – comic books can get away with massive action set pieces because they have put in the work to make you care. That’s why bad superhero movies are so bad: they flatten the genre not just into mediocrity, but into a direct foil of its most powerful appeal.

I chose this book as it was out of my comfort zone, not quite political and literary enough and definitely looked like nothing like my normal light read. I wanted a challenge. </p> <p>The cover of the novel is nice, but the GIRL ON A PLANE font looks too much like the Hollywood text and the scene seems heavily photo shopped. So good... but just good. Nothing better. </p> <p>And I know they say don’t judge a book on the cover, but the cover reflects the text in so many ways and the judgement I made from the beginning was (for once) so very correct. </p> <p>My first and last problem with Girl On A Plane was the characters. The novel is based on a true story and once I saw that plastered across the front page I expected somewhat more relatable characters. But the author felt the need to only <em>base</em> her story upon it and while I’m sure this was to make the characters more interesting, with this came the fact that the antagonists and some side creations feel extremely forced. There were many things I doubted about the teenager’s un-teenage-like behaviour and the adults’ un-adult behaviour, to the very terrorists that hijacked the plane.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"03b799e98c6b98143357a32483c676607a748f04\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/03b799e98c6b98143357a32483c676607a748f04/0_0_180_276/180.jpg\" alt=\"Girl on a Plane\" width=\"180\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The main problem with the novel is that it is dipping into the ocean without actually swimming; it’s recalling a true event but at the same time it feels as though it isn’t really. Which leads me to my next point: I really believe that Girl On A Plane could have been great if the author based it fully upon what had happened. Yes, perhaps it could have created something extremely boring; I admit 4 days in a closed plane with nothing to do does not make for a very interesting novel. However Moss still could have done it. Sometime the best authors are not those who can create the most interesting plots but those who use the simplest ideas to write something great. I could give you many examples: Roald Dahl and R.J. Palacio, who wrote Wonder, are just a few.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Girl On A Plane did not need all the things I suspect the author made up to create a more interesting story. All Miriam Moss needed was a faint string of a memory from her very unique childhood. She could have made something great with what she had, because I have no problem with the fast-paced writing style or the plot – just that in the quest to create something good, she ruined what she had.

Why did he do it – and what happened next?","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Imagine getting rid of your entire library and starting afresh. This is exactly what Shaheryar Malik has done, in as dramatic a manner as possible.</p> <p>About a year ago, he decided he would leave stacks of about 40 of his books in several public spaces in New York until he was left with none. Eight times over, he piled them up in places such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the High Line or a subway platform, and just walked away.</p> <p>He has no idea what happened next, nor does he want to, as the whole point of this experiment was to avoid a digital trace (beyond one <a href=\"http://daniyim.com/reading-project/q8ryheg21ggyvaxn3szeiimz2odbvb\" title=\"\">photograph for each stack</a>).</p> <p>He wanted the experience to be reserved for those who were there at that very moment, he explained. The books ranged from everything from novels to gardening guides to photography and the fall of the Third Reich to fiction. He would put the tomes with the most unusual titles on top, such as <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Decision-Book/\" title=\"\">The Decision Book: 50 Models for Strategic Thinking</a>, or Physics for You, which has “such a beautiful illustration on the cover”, he says.</p> <p>This started a year ago, when Malik, an art director originally from London, walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and got the urge to take a selfie. “Then I stopped and thought: ‘Instead of taking the picture that has been taken millions of times, I’m going to share something different with the world.’</p> <p>“A book moves you, touches you, annoys you. You’re on the Brooklyn Bridge, how about you transform yourself by travelling to this other world?”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"414684f5a0fda8a7c25c53a802382ddb9f2b0799\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/414684f5a0fda8a7c25c53a802382ddb9f2b0799/0_0_1500_1483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Times Square station, NYC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"989\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Times Square station, NYC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Yim</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Would people ignore the stacks, bump into them, see them as pile of rubbish? He has no idea what the immediate reactions have been, because he doesn’t stick around. “I’d be really anxious if I did.” However, he did leave bookmarks with his email address inside the books, and he has received more than 60 emails from people in 30 countries so far.</p> <p>Now with empty shelves, he feels “lifted”. “I have given away something, but I’ve never really left them. What you’ve read becomes you and stays in you, and now they carry on and get extra lives. A woman in Holland said she’d left it on a train there for someone else to pick it up.”</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e65fb46c396c571fc31f5275a157a6e2ffcf0fcb\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e65fb46c396c571fc31f5275a157a6e2ffcf0fcb/0_297_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Central Park, NYC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Central Park, NYC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Yim</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t34c","wordcount":"392","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/33bccb38ba0c683aa2936d01504f54f0f9d14d72/0_476_1500_899/500.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-08T14:58:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Shaheryar Malik emptied his apartment of books by leaving them in huge heaps in public spaces across Manhattan.

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture. I wrote them all; I told their stories.</p> <p>And then I started to write a book.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"715","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback. Since Alex Malarkey’s letter broke, Burpo’s been making the rounds of television shows proclaiming that he still believes he saw heaven. “I still remember my experience my heaven,” he <a href=\"http://www.charismanews.com/us/47938-colton-burpo-i-still-remember-my-experience-in-heaven\">insisted to Christian outlets</a>.</p> <p>Phil Johnson explains the continuing faith in these stories by reference to scripture: “The Bible says people like fables.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/45xtn","wordcount":"3166","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/18/1421608387704/33117807-d7f4-4ad6-92c7-b71b87d80dba-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-24T12:30:04Z","standfirst":"<p>Alex Malarkey co-wrote a bestselling book about a near-death experience – and then last week admitted he made it up.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep.

This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you.

great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"439","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1024","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

until his death this year. Here she recalls the Labour veteran’s playful side – and the time they were joined by eager young intern Ed Miliband","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>I met Tony Benn at the end of 1985, and worked for him until his death in March 2014. When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This
