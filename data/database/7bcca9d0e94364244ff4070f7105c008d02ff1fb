        "body":"<p>Tom Alexander, the former EE boss and founder of Virgin Mobile, who made a fortune for Sir Richard Branson by helping democratise the mobile phone, has returned to the telecoms industry.</p><p>The sports car racing enthusiast left EE to spend more time with his collection of classic cars in July 2011, but has now returned as non-executive chairman of Viacloud.</p><p>Private equity owned Viacloud was set up to create white label virtual mobile networks for consumer brands, by wholesaling airtime on EE's platform. It hopes to create the UK's first 4G virtual network, and has the billing platforms, customer support and network management tools to support up to 7 million customers. Its first client will come to market within weeks.</p><p>\"The internet is rife with a whole number of strong consumer brands, like games companies, bringing interesting propositions to consumers and all of that is going mobile,\" said Alexander. \"4G is going to open up a massive opportunity for content players.\"</p><p>Supermarkets including Asda and Tesco already sell mobile connections, and those Mobile Network Virtual Operators (MVNOs) already using EE's masts include Phones 4u and TalkTalk business customers.</p><p>Alexander made headlines last year with efforts to co-ordinate an £8bn private equity bid for his former company, EE, with KKR and Apax Partners mentioned as potential backers. EE's owners, Orange and Deutsche Telekom, are expected to float the company next year.</p><p>In 1998, Alexander persuaded Branson to back his plan for a consumer friendly mobile brand, which would piggy back on T-Mobile's masts. The venture made £20m for Alexander and much more than that for Virgin Group.</p><p>Branson floated the company for £500m in 2004 and then sold for nearly £1bn to NTL in 2006, as part of a complex deal that united Britain's two largest cable operators into Virgin Media.</p><p>\"With Virgin Mobile we helped bring the mobile phone mass market,\" Alexander said some years later. \"Before, it was a corporate tool, or for a select few. Virgin democratised the mobile and made it available to everyone.\" Viacloud marks Alexander's second telecoms comeback. He left Virgin in 2006, after its sale to NTL, but was persuaded back to run Orange in the UK in 2008. Within two years, he had merged the business with T-Mobile, creating a market leader with 28m customers by uniting the country's third and fourth biggest players.</p><p>Alexander said he was planning a gradual return to corporate life. \"It doesn't feel like I've really left,\" he said. \"I needed to discover I had a family but I've kept in touch with friends. I had a nice break but I will look at putting together a portfolio of non-executive posts next year.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418819169|2013-10-17T12:52:54Z|869bc61c413426f0484171df4b11cbc7508e5f16 -->",
