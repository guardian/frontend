        "headline":"Rosie Lowe (New band of the day: No 1,612)",
        "body":"<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Devon.    <br />      <br /><strong>The lineup</strong>: Rosie Lowe (vocals).  </p><p><strong>The background</strong>: The photo accompanying this column of today's new artist, with her jacket half on, covering her left side – unless it's some bizarre new avant-fashion statement comprising only half a jacket – makes us think of the famous front cover of Patti Smith's <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/PattiSmithHorses.jpg\">Horses</a>. Which is interesting because the artist in question, London-based singer-songwriter Rosie Lowe – who comes originally from Devon – doesn't operate in the area of rock, or punk, or poetic rock-punk, or whatever it was that Smith did, even if she does have some of her angular androgyny. No, she makes a slow, stealthily affecting kind of soul with intimations of stylised depravity, like Jessie Ware fronting the Weeknd during a lost weekend. And she's got some front, or at least that image above seems designed to telegraph that this music, for all the smoothness of the vocals, the jazzy languor and sultry immaculacy, is more of an affront than it seems. </p><p>Her debut EP, the Right Thing, is a collaboration with producers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/02/new-band-of-the-day-kwes0\">Kwes</a> and Dave Okumu of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/09/new-band-the-invisible\">the Invisible</a>, both capable of creating a ruffled sumptuousness, shiny surfaces with bumps and kinks. Her cameo appearance on Night Slugs alum Lil Silva's recent deep house anthem No Doubt didn't really offer any idea of her worth or her own work. The multi-instrumentalist  who sort of but not quite evinces a childhood exposed to the voices of Ella Fitzgerald and Bjork, who knows a thing or two about loops, pitch-shifting and distortion, and who is backed by an all-female band onstage, is a sonic adventurer in the guise of a stylish androgen. </p><p>The four songs on her EP, by the way, are all fabulous – it really is an EP of the year. Think a more machinic Mvula, or an xx-rated Sade. The title track is our kind of spacious, lightly-enhanced heartbreak R&amp;B, with beats – gentle detonations, really – reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5rx_Ne86eA\">first-album Drake</a>. 10k Balloons is almost folkish, with a superbly clear vocal backed by soft guitar strums and assorted echoes of silence. Games, from its title in, suggests high-life drama with a hint of sleaze (\"Won't you save me from these guilty games?\"), and if that doesn't get you, the killer chord changes will. Finally, there's Me and Your Ghost, a skewed synth hymn of spectral power with glitchy interference and atonal interruptions, like Rose Royce's Wishing on a Star refixed by Kid 606. Let's just say <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/Kid606-The-Action-Packed-Mentallist-Brings-You-The-Fucking-Jams/release/36615\">the action packed experimentalist brings you the fucking slow jams</a>.</p><p><strong>The buzz</strong>: <a href=\" http://flyingwithanna.com/2013/01/19/new-treat-148-rosie-lowe/\">\"Effortless R&amp;B beats, experimental electronica, minimalism, the art of understatement.\"</a>  </p><p><strong>The truth</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/06/fka-twigs\">FKA Twigs</a> has a rival in the idiosyncratic Brit R&amp;B stakes.<br /> <br /><strong>Most likely to</strong>: Do the right - that is to say left(field) - thing. </p><p><strong>Least likely to</strong>: Move back to Devon. </p><p><strong>What to buy</strong>: The Right Thing EP is released by 37 Adventures on December 2. <br />  <br /><strong>File next to</strong>: Jessie Ware, Jessy Lanza, Abel Tesfaye, FKA Twigs.        </p><p><strong>Links</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rosie-Lowe/316105161779031\">facebook.com/pages/Rosie-Lowe</a>. </p><p><strong>Tuesday's new band</strong>: Telegram.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419200572|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f8029e91065572ecd8937d1582087bd779bbb55d -->",

If that's true, then this is the zombie apocalypse. Brummie youngster Subzee D's remix piles samples of MC Sgt Pokes bellowing \"Someone say FUCK OFF!\", plus lasers, machine guns, car crushers, angry geese, choking ogres, all the emergency services, exploding Chinese chemical research factories and the inevitable death of civilisation over a beat made from pure swagger. It is the most punk thing you will hear this year.</p><h2><strong>Anna Calvi </strong><br /><strong>Eliza (Domino)</strong></h2><p><br /><a href=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/20gmnV5Xkro?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\">Reading this on mobile?

Stirring stuff, indeed.</p><h2><strong>Eminem </strong><br /><strong>Berzerk (Interscope)</strong></h2><p><br /><a href=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/i/31979/vidId=2040355&amp;la=n\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p><p>Hard to tell if getting Rick Rubin in to add Beastie Boys pastiche to the mix is supposed to make Em sound younger or be an admission of encroaching middle age. Either way, although it feels bodged-together, he does rap snappily over some gloriously fighty guitars. Crucially, it's the least self-pitying – and thus best – thing he's done in a long time.</p><h2><strong>TRC </strong><br /><strong>Come Bring It/You &amp; Me (Crazylegs)</strong></h2><p><br /><a href=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F106599610\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to listen</a></p><p>Poor old UK garage. Shoved aside by its mutant offspring grime and dubstep, it appeared to have disappeared up its own nose for good in the mid-2000s. But actually, via northern \"bassline house\" – the scene that birthed Wolverhampton producer TRC – it stuck around in surprisingly rude health. On these two tracks, TRC brings all the skippety beats, groaning sub-bass and girl-next-door R&amp;B vocals you could want for a hip-twitching, Moschino-wearing good time. It's not \"neo garage\" or \"future garage\", just living, breathing British electronic soul.</p><h2><strong>Rabit </strong><br /><strong>Sun Showers EP (Diskotopia)</strong></h2><p><br /><a href=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/SQqzDKNQ0zY?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\">Reading this on mobile?

When you get mad Texan scientists making tracks like these four – all vertiginous empty spaces, whirling razorblade cymbals and synth noises that leap out of the shadows and bite your knees – origins and influence don't seem important.</p><h2><strong>The Feeling </strong><br /><strong>Rescue (BMG)</strong></h2><p><br /><a href=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/LgsE_YpCiAg?enablejsapi=1&amp;version=3\">Reading this on mobile?

        "body":"<p>Eventually, it seems, the ultra-nerds invade everything, and the latest sphere of popular culture to fall is hip-hop. It's already creaking under the weight of self-consciously spoddy lyricists and battlers, such as the UK's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNtw6Fon_QM\" title=\"\">Marlo, Shuffle-T</a> and Mos Prob, and insanely anal compilers of statistics such as <a href=\"http://www.versetracker.com/\" title=\"\">VerseTracker</a>, which reveals that the seven most popular battle rappers in the world all come from the Philippines.</p><p>But the best of all these ventures is one that packs a solid maths base. <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/\" title=\"\">Rap Genius</a> is a kind of rap lyric Wikipedia, but it's in its <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/rapstats\" title=\"\">Rap Stats</a> section where the fun happens. It proffers a hip-hop take on those pop-culture Venn diagramsthat we all love, quantifying the absurd lyrical excesses of rap through the years with numerical line graphs. Thus, we learn that, <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/rapstats?q=gat%2C%20gun\" title=\"\">although \"gat\" is in stark decline, the more prosaic \"gun\" has enjoyed a 25-year dominance</a> as the weaponry term of choice. </p><p>Elsewhere, we find tha since 1992, the desire to \"get money\" has become <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/rapstats?q=get%20money%2C%20get%20bitches\" title=\"\">six times more important than the wish to \"get bitches\"</a>, and that <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/rapstats?q=mo%20money%2C%20mo%20problems\" title=\"\">mo' money in no way equates with mo' problems</a>, with the former notion actually being 19 times more statistically prevalent than the latter in 2013. Want to know when \"dawg\" became a preferable term of endearment to \"Dogg\"? Apparently <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/rapstats?q=dawg%2C%20dogg\" title=\"\">it was 2002</a>. Perhaps the most poignant graph is <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/rapstats?q=OPP\" title=\"\">the OPP one</a>, which peaks around the time of the Naughty By Nature pop-rap classic and then plunges to practically zero for two decades.</p><p>Best of all, you can do your own statistical searches, which are converted into graph form in seconds. This is why we can confirm that \"shimmy ya\" does indeed hold sway over \"shimmy yo\" and \"shimmy yay\". Phew.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419086821|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|f1846424922918a48936f27d229b30073f5a021c -->",

        "headline":"Transcender in C – review",
        "body":"<p>Terry Riley's In C is a canonised classic of American minimalism, based around 53 different motifs that the performer has control over in terms of number of repetitions. It's like dada meets Henry Ford: play what you like, as long as it's these notes. It therefore lends itself well to reinterpretation, and there are two takes tonight: the first by Matthew Herbert's trio of electronic improvisers backed by Starlight, a chamber ensemble of brass and woodwind, the second by Pantha Du Prince and the Bell Laboratory, with bell-ringers led by the German minimal techno producer.</p><p>The first is the most successful, a shifting suite of moods that draw out In&nbsp;C's potential layer of menace. Herbert's interventions are initially brusque, a bold daub of noise cutting through the opening section, but become increasingly subtle as he samples on the fly and adds mild glitches to a base layer of sound. There are brilliant flourishes, such as a smattering of tinny drum kit across an aqueous woodwind passage, but perhaps the real star is Joshua Light Show, who provide live visuals. The originators of the illuminated ink droplets that are such a cliche of miniskirted 60s dance scenes, their work is still so original, with flexing organic light forms, florid blood flows and shudders of metallic texture.</p><p>Their visuals align more closely with the music of the second performance, ink flapping like a vogueing jellyfish to pounding house handclaps. Pantha Du Prince and his group are dressed in aprons, as if working at a Whole Foods franchise managed by Kraftwerk, and their starchy tastefulness is initially drab. But their leader's increasingly rumpled drum programming gives it heft, and a final performance of their own work Spectral Split is tropically probing. Each version could have so easily been reverential or wacky – instead they find new grooves in Riley's&nbsp;generous and spiritually rich&nbsp;work.</p><p>• Did you catch this gig – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>Next year's Glastonbury festival sold out in record time on Sunday as hundreds of thousands of music fans scrambled to book their place.</p><p>Around 120,000 tickets, costing £210 each, were snapped up in one hour and 27 minutes, according to organisers, who said more than one million people had registered for the event.</p><p>Michael and Emily Eavis, who put on the festival, said in a statement: \"We have, once again, been blown away by the numbers of people who were hoping to join us at the festival, and we're sorry that many of you have missed out on a ticket.</p><p>\"We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed.\"</p><p>Technical issues affected the first 30 minutes of sales, but See Tickets said that after the glitch around 3,000 tickets a minute were being sold.</p><p>Next year's festival takes place on Eavis's farm from 25 to 29 June. Last month Eavis said that the headliners were \"more or less in place\".</p><p>\"They're three bands who haven't played Glastonbury, and that's important,\" Eavis told NME. \"There aren't many bands left who haven't played the festival, and before we run out I'd like to persuade the ones on my wishlist to come down. I think I've managed that with these three.\"</p><p>Immediately fans began guessing. The website eFestivals had already suggested back in July that Fleetwood Mac, Depeche Mode and Elbow could be the 2014 headliners. But Gigwise discarded the \"bands\" idea and proposed the involvement of festival \"virgins\" such as Daft Punk, the Strokes, Rihanna, Adele, Kanye West and a reunited Led Zeppelin. The bookies' favourites are Oasis, the Foo Fighters and David Bowie.</p><p>Although Eavis's daughter, Emily, books most of Glastonbury's lineup, Worthy Farm's 77-year-old owner still picks the top of the bill. He has already said 2014 will be a step down from this past summer's festival, at which the Rolling Stones headlined with Arctic Monkeys and Mumford &amp; Sons.</p><p>\"I'm not going to say we can do it better because we can't, that was the ultimate festival this year,\" he told BBC Newsbeat. \"Downhill all the way now. I've had 44 years of an incredible career and we're still milking the old cows as well.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419176208|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7adea37b973f7a43bb0e4a363aace1e3ca54dffa -->",

        "headline":"Hallé/Elder – review",
        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.britten100.org/home\" title=\"\">The Britten centenary</a> has thrown up some curiosities, though none more curious than the premiere of a suite of incidental music Britten composed for a series of wartime radio dramas. Entitled An American in Britain, the playlets were somewhat like Alistair Cooke's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f6hbp\" title=\"\">Letter from America</a> in reverse; though as an indication of how obscure these pieces have become, Hallé timpanist <a href=\"http://www.halle.co.uk/musicians-of-the-orchestra.aspx\" title=\"\">John Abendstern</a> tracked down the broadcasts on the internet, as the BBC neglected to preserve a copy.</p><p>Actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/10/sam-west-family-values\" title=\"\">Samuel West</a> added just enough narrative for the pieces to hang from in a dry, Chandleresque tone; and though few of the musical sequences topped out at more than a minute, their dramatic economy implied that the composer was already limbering up to write <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/18/peter-grimes-on-the-beach-aldeburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">Peter Grimes</a>. Yet the piecemeal aural collage hardly qualified as a lost masterpiece. A lugubrious descending passage inspired by the London Underground seemed to indicate that it would be impossible to let the Britten year to go by without resurrecting his elevator music.</p><p>In the same week that the play was broadcast in August 1942, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0198krt/Twenty_Minutes_Shostakovichs_Symphony_No_7/\" title=\"\">Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony</a> was given its first performance in the besieged city of Leningrad. The symphony is often presented as a shout of triumph over adversity; and while Mark Elder's interpretation had some exultant moments, he displayed a profound understanding of Shostakovich's ability to temper celebration with a note of despair. The jaunty march, repeated so many times you wonder if the needle has become stuck, acquired the manic hilarity of a Rossini overture played with a rictus grin; the finale conveyed a Beckettian sense of absurdity that, for the Russian people, the defeat of fascism merely earned the right to continue to live under communism.</p><p>• Did you catch this performance – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>Performing all Bach's solo sonatas and partitas in one evening is the endurance test of choice for a certain, cerebral kind of violinist. <a href=\"http://www.artsmg.com/Strings/IsabelleFaust/index.html\" title=\"\">Isabelle Faust</a>'s attempt on violin Everest comes after her award-winning recording, and her approach to this music remains hard to pin down. Playing on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgut\" title=\"\">gut</a> strings, she uses <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato\" title=\"\">vibrato</a> so sparingly that it becomes another decoration, like the sweet-sounding trills and twiddles with which she seasons some of the lighter movements; yet despite these nods to historical authenticity, her Bach has a modern sensibility. This didn't feel like a&nbsp;\"period\" performance.</p><p>Nor did it feel like a Bach marathon: it was more a concert of six distinct works in which all happened to be by the same composer. So whereas the Sonata No&nbsp;1 flowed with an almost easy gracefulness, the first partita had a touch of impatience that made it sound subtly yet entirely different.</p><p>The \"doubles\" that come after each of the four main movements of that partita found Faust experimenting with different, softer timbres; one of them, played with the bow further than usual from the bridge of the violin, could almost have been coming from underwater. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/15/isabelle-faust-violin-musical-sleuth-interview\" title=\"\">Faust has pointed out</a> that we are not sure whether Bach ever intended these works to be played in front of an audience, and these movements seemed private indeed.</p><p>The Partita No 3 was a series of buoyant dances. The weightier Sonata No 3, in contrast, found Faust tending to linger, and the thickly woven opening adagio threatened to grind to a halt; this was perhaps her one misjudgment all&nbsp;evening.</p><p>She ended with the Partita No 2, having presumably broken the numerical order so she could close with the great D minor <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv5HmKomT7Y\" title=\"\">Chaconne</a>. Beautifully, searchingly played, the Chaconne was no anticlimax, but it wasn't quite the big finish we might have expected. Still, perhaps that was the point: it didn't eclipse the variety and beauty of what had gone before, but added to it instead.</p><p>• Did you catch this performance – or any other recently?

        "headline":"Jason – review",
        "body":"<p>First heard in Venice in 1649, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Cavalli\" title=\"\">Francesco Cavalli</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giasone\" title=\"\">Giasone</a> – given as <a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/jason\" title=\"\">Jason</a> by <a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/\" title=\"\">English Touring Opera</a> – was the most popular Italian opera of the 17th century, performed Europe-wide and much imitated, until subsequent generations turned against it. Cavalli is one of music's greatest eroticists, though after his death, and until recently, his frankness was deemed offensive by many. Ambivalently analysing male sexuality and its consequences, Jason also plays fast and loose with classical narrative in ways that later ages, believing mythology to be sacrosanct, considered&nbsp;suspect.</p><p>Cavalli's starting point is Jason's wedding night with Medea in Colchis, prior to his theft of the Golden Fleece. Cavalli's glorious music suggests that Jason's sensuality is an irresistible, unstoppable force. But it also rapidly becomes apparent that he is a bigamist, who has dumped his first wife Isiphile and their children on the island of Lemnos, where the gods soon conveniently contrive to wreck his ship. A series of tragi-comic confrontations between the protagonists, under the watchful eyes of their servants and sidekicks, leads to eventual if uncertain resolution, but only after an alarming climax in which Isiphile exposes both her own obsessive nature and Jason's moral weakness by demanding he stab her to death, but spare her breasts so that their children can suckle from her&nbsp;corpse.</p><p>The opera is immensely long. No modern revival or recording has ever presented it complete, and ETO use a version – roughly half the score – prepared by the director <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Eyre\" title=\"\">Ronald Eyre</a> for a Buxton festival revival in 1984. The first half feels bitty, as if too much is missing. But once we reach Lemnos after the interval, the almost Shakespearian collisions between comedy and intensity prove remarkably&nbsp;compelling.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.tedhuffman.com/\" title=\"\">Ted Huffman</a>'s straightforward production, designed by <a href=\"http://www.samalblak.com/\" title=\"\">Samal Blak</a>, plays itself out in a series of similar, white-panelled rooms that contrast chic Colchis with decrepit Lemnos. The costumes cleverly link art nouveau with 1980s new romantic: Jason (<a href=\"http://saoperasingers.homestead.com/Clint_van_der_Linde_Bio.html\" title=\"\">Clint Van der Linde</a>) and his chum Hercules (<a href=\"http://www.andrew-slater.com/\" title=\"\">Andrew Slater</a>) look as if they might have strayed from Adam Ant's Prince Charming video. Van der Linde, with his silky countertenor, sounds glamorous as well as looks it, and by the end we fully understand why <a href=\"http://www.hannahpedley.com/\" title=\"\">Hannah Pedley</a>'s self-assured Medea and <a href=\"http://catrinekirkman.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Catrine Kirkman</a>'s desperate Isiphile are trapped in his orbit. Among the servants whose comments add multiple layers of irony to the drama, Piotr Lempa's bewildered Orestes and Peter Aisher's stammering Demus are particularly good. There's nice conducting from <a href=\"http://laserenissima.co.uk/biographies/joseph-mchardy/\" title=\"\">Joseph McHardy</a>,&nbsp;too.</p><p>• Did you catch this show – or any other recently?

        "body":"<p>Mac Miller offers an invitation during the call-and-response chorus of <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/Mac-miller-gees-lyrics\" title=\"\">Gees</a>, one that invites the listener to both receive a male appendage in their mouth, and have it slapped across their cheeks. That he's actually concerned with it being a tongue that goes into cheek is revealed in his third pass through the chrorus, when he adds: \"Now just the parents!\" And so continues modern rap's tiresome plot to make sexual violence sound like a slightly naughty lark.</p><p>He may be the other independent hip-hop act to top the Billboard Hot 100 of late, beside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macklemore\" title=\"\">Macklemore &amp; Lewis</a>, but Miller clearly has no similar intentions to upturn rap's homophobic and misogynistic boat. Jerking around in the hoodie, shorts and shades of a chronic GTA5 addict, his boorish machismo and cheesy stoner shtick make it tough to empathise later, when he plays the jilted rom-hop victim on a stirring <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7R2xcExtR4\" title=\"\">Missed Calls</a>, about his girlfriend ditching him in a torrent of abuse. What on earth could've gone wrong there, Mac?</p><p>As thick as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDUC1LUXSU\" title=\"\">Thicke</a>, Miller is nonetheless more talented than you'd expect from someone with <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/shows/mac_miller_most_dope_family/series.jhtml\" title=\"\">his own MTV2 reality show</a>. His rapid rhymes are so drilled and acrobatic you could imagine his tonsils being trained from the age of three by a Russian gymnastics coach. His backbeats run a stylish gamut from the sepulchre rap of Eminem's more thunder-cloaked moments to nursery mobile melodies, Daft Punk vocoder disco, silent movie chase music and, on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmEpkztK5Lw\" title=\"\">Knock Knock</a>, a showtune akin to Singin' in the Rain with more balling. </p><p>Yet, with the air of a glorified PA to plug his second album Watching Movies With the Sound Off, Miller's set looks to fizzle into Notorious BIG and Bob Marley covers until saved by fierce tumbles through <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ19PJ7-SWc\" title=\"\">Frick Park Market</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0gdCFxZ3Pw\" title=\"\">Lucky Ass Bitch</a> that open venue-wide circle pits and inspire Miller to attempt frantic, uncourteous lovemaking with a nearby stage-light. His wild claims that \"This gon' be the best day ever!\", though, are only justified in that he hasn't yet had to beat fellatio out of anyone.</p><p>• Did you catch this gig – or any other recently?

        "headline":"Die Fledermaus; Steven Osborne – review",
        "body":"<p>Everyone in <a href=\"http://www.eno.org/fledermaus\" title=\"\"><strong>Die Fledermaus</strong></a> is a little tipsy, and perhaps it pays to be slightly plastered oneself before entering the auditorium. Indeed at English National Opera's new staging by Christopher Alden it might have been wise to be totally blotto. Things started badly with a sagging overture, lacking the crystalline precision that makes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Johann_Strauss_II.jpg\" title=\"\">Johann Strauss II</a>'s Viennese waltzing operetta glitter and intoxicate. Mild vaudeville fun never did anyone any harm, even if secretly you might prefer to be at<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/elektra-by-charles-edwards\" title=\"\"><em> Elektra</em></a> by an unrelated but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Strauss3.jpg\" title=\"\">similarly named composer</a>.</p><p>But no, this was not to be fun at all. Soon, as we settled back for a few warm-hearted chortles, we were metaphorically clonked on the head by a jackbooted prison officer mimicking Nazi salutes and wagging a truncheon. A 1920s-ish salon with a vast, draped bed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)\" title=\"\">the size of Greater Bulgaria</a> was quickly revealed to be no mere bedroom but a landscape of the mind with all its many chambers. Have I mentioned the pendulum pocket watch? Much ticking goes on in the witty score, but this – judging by size alone; it was big enough for the human \"bat\" of the title to sit astride it – was also a metaphor of mighty psychological importance which I must leave you to work out. It was omnipresent.</p><p>This production, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJFOmTw5Y\" title=\"\">already staged in Toronto</a>, was to be a serious and profound <em>Fledermaus</em>: all about Freud, the seamy underbelly of life in fin-de-siècle Vienna and sexual weirdness of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_von_Sacher-Masoch\" title=\"\">Sacher-Masoch </a>rather than Sachertorte variety – as if we don't see enough of all that in the opera house already. Freud was born in 1856. The premiere of Johann Strauss II's <em>Die Fledermaus</em> (The Bat) was 1874. It was a heavy-handed updating. <a href=\"http://constancehoffman.com/\" title=\"\">Constance Hoffman</a>'s delicious costumes – one of the few strengths of this leaden show – made the most of a strange line-up of partygoers, from transvestite ballerina to animal trainer to geisha to clown, with much use of exposed suspenders.</p><p>The first 40 minutes dragged with barely a titter except from someone who sounded like a laughing machine – sitting, interestingly, in the front stalls right in the middle of the production team – and who simply exaggerated everyone else's stony silence. Soon we, or rather Alfred the \"Italian\" tenor, who on this occasion was Lithuanian (<a href=\"http://www.edgarasmontvidas.com/\" title=\"\">Edgaras Montvidas</a>), were down to our underpants, immediately followed by a three-in-a-bed romp. At any given opportunity the pearl-grey satin counterpane heaved and danced in erotic grotesquerie.</p><p>The bored Prince Orlofsky (<a href=\"http://jenniferhollowaymezzo.com/jenniferhollowaymezzo.com/Home.html\" title=\"\">Jennifer Holloway</a>), at whose ball much of the plot's jiggery pokery unfolds, bore no resemblance to any kind of sane human being, ululating, flailing arms, doing funny walks – all reasonable, no doubt, if you're underemployed wealthy Russian royalty, but unbearable to watch. Christopher Alden is a wonderful, inspired director – his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeygUo8O_hw\" title=\"\"><em>The Makropoulos Case</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYw8ECo7OFA\" title=\"\"><em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em></a> at ENO were outstanding – but here, perhaps in a cold panic, he has encouraged his poor singers to exaggerate gesture and mannerism ad nauseam. Fortunately Holloway was fine when released from all this grim harness and allowed to sing.</p><p><a href=\"http://imgartists.com/artist/tom_randle\" title=\"\">Tom Randle</a>, a versatile and endlessly classy performer, seemed to be doing his best to keep some proper restraint to proceedings and was a cool, caddish Eisenstein. He and <a href=\"http://www.ingpen.co.uk/artist/andrew-shore/\" title=\"\">Andrew Shore</a> as Frank, a prison governor, ensured a degree of skilful comic timing which helped but could not rescue the show. Most of the dialogue was inaudible, and if there were jokes they got lost in translation, to put it kindly. <a href=\"http://juliasporsen.com/\" title=\"\">Julia Sporsén</a>, as Rosalinde, sounded underpowered in the opening phrases of the Czárdás, though her performance was sympathetic and stylish. <a href=\"http://musichall.uk.com/artist.aspx?artist=62&amp;name=Richard+Burkhard&amp;category=Baritones\" title=\"\">Richard Burkhard</a>'s Dr Falke, complete with bat wings, stood out for clarity and stage presence. The German actor <a href=\"http://janpohl.com/JP/Jan_Pohl.html\" title=\"\">Jan Pohl </a>looked very uncomfortable as Frosch, he of the jackboots and salutes, as well he might. If only the brilliant ENO orchestra had sounded happier. <a href=\"http://www.lewin-management.com/artists/19_Eun+Sun+Kim/englishbio\" title=\"\">Eun Sun Kim</a>, making her house debut as conductor, was unable to elicit either vitality or exactitude from this score. What an evening.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113150'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380905931473/steven-osborne-001.jpg' alt='steven osborne' width='210' height='286' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Steven Osborne: ‘breathtaking’. Photograph: Mark Pinder</figcaption></figure><p>The Scottish pianist <a href=\"http://www.stevenosborne.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Steven Osborne</strong></a>, who last month won a <a href=\"http://www.gramophone.co.uk/awards/2013/instrumental\" title=\"\">Gramophone award</a> to add to the other prizes and praises justifiably heaped on him, began a four-concert series at <a href=\"http://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Wigmore Hall </a>with some exceptional Beethoven playing: two groups of Bagatelles and two sonatas, the \"Waldstein\" Op 53 and Op 111. In a breathtaking recital, Osborne gave a definitive performance of this last, which opens in mid-breath, tempestuous and agitated, and ends with an endless, ethereal simplicity.</p><p>The audience, as one, was agog. <a href=\"http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hyperion</a> were there to record it, and you can hear it <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">on iPlayer until Tuesday</a>. Osborne's attack is ferocious and fearless, his tenderness beyond words. His self appears subsumed in service to the composer. This is the best it gets.</p><p><em>Star ratings (out of 5)</em>:<br /><em>Die Fledermaus </em>★<br /><em>Steven Osborne </em>★★★★★</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419100032|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b025cf7062098b74a266e7514d991788fb38afac -->",

        "body":"<p>Next year's Glastonbury festival sold out in record time on Sunday as hundreds of thousands of music fans scrambled to book their place.</p><p>Around 120,000 tickets, costing £210 each, were snapped up in one hour and 27 minutes, according to organisers, who said more than one million people had registered for the event.</p><p>Michael and Emily Eavis, who put on the festival, said in a statement: \"We have, once again, been blown away by the numbers of people who were hoping to join us at the festival, and we're sorry that many of you have missed out on a ticket.</p><p>\"We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed.\"</p><p>Technical issues affected the first 30 minutes of sales, but See Tickets said that after the glitch around 3,000 tickets a minute were being sold.</p><p>Next year's festival takes place on Eavis's farm from 25 to 29 June. Last month Eavis said that the headliners were \"more or less in place\".</p><p>\"They're three bands who haven't played Glastonbury, and that's important,\" Eavis told NME. \"There aren't many bands left who haven't played the festival, and before we run out I'd like to persuade the ones on my wishlist to come down. I think I've managed that with these three.\"</p><p>Immediately fans began guessing. The website eFestivals had already suggested back in July that Fleetwood Mac, Depeche Mode and Elbow could be the 2014 headliners. But Gigwise discarded the \"bands\" idea and proposed the involvement of festival \"virgins\" such as Daft Punk, the Strokes, Rihanna, Adele, Kanye West and a reunited Led Zeppelin. The bookies' favourites are Oasis, the Foo Fighters and David Bowie.</p><p>Although Eavis's daughter, Emily, books most of Glastonbury's lineup, Worthy Farm's 77-year-old owner still picks the top of the bill. He has already said 2014 will be a step down from this past summer's festival, at which the Rolling Stones headlined with Arctic Monkeys and Mumford &amp; Sons.</p><p>\"I'm not going to say we can do it better because we can't, that was the ultimate festival this year,\" he told BBC Newsbeat. \"Downhill all the way now. I've had 44 years of an incredible career and we're still milking the old cows as well.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419176208|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7adea37b973f7a43bb0e4a363aace1e3ca54dffa -->",

        "headline":"Sinéad O'Connor threatens Miley Cyrus with legal action after mental illness tweet",
        "body":"<p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sineadoconnor/posts/601024469936545\" title=\"\">a post on Facebook</a>, Sinéad O'Connor has threatened to take legal action against Miley Cyrus, after the Wrecking Ball singer publicly mocked the singer's battle with mental illness. Cyrus was accused of \"stupid and dangerous\" behaviour after tweeting a screen grab of O'Connor's Twitter page from two years ago and comparing her to the troubled star Amanda Bynes. The tweets were sent during a period when the Nothing Compares 2 U singer was suffering from bipolar disorder.</p><p>\"I do not at all support or condone the abuse or mockery of those who have been brave enough to openly discuss mental health issues,\" O'Connor wrote. \"Mockery causes deaths. Period. It is an unacceptable form of bullying, no matter who it is doing the bullying.\"</p><p>She added: \"She has done this in an attempt to deliberately cause me harm and hurt. I wish to confirm that I am quite well and kindly request people cease emailing me in the mistaken belief these are recent tweets. Ms Cyrus's lawyers will be contacted by mine regarding this matter.\"</p><p>The dispute comes after two days in which Cyrus has become the subject of global attention following an open letter in which O'Connor warned Cyrus that the music industry could \"pimp\" her sexuality. Since then, a flurry of media attention has surrounded the debate, with a tsunami of think pieces, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/03/miley-cyrus-prostitute-warns-sinead-oconnor\" title=\"\">open letters</a> and tweets.</p><p>Amanda Palmer was one of the first stars to wade in, defending O'Connor's projection <a href=\"http://amandapalmer.tumblr.com/post/63011904833/oltosoc\" title=\"\">via her blog</a>, stating: \"I love you. I grew up worshipping your music and your bold attitude and, especially, your refusal to sign up to the bullshit beauty standard.\" But Palmer also argued that Cyrus should \"write her own script\", rather than follow anyone else's advice. \"She's writing the plot and signing the checks, and although I think it's tempting to imagine her in the board room of label assholes and management, I don't think any of them masterminded her current plan to be a raging, naked, twerking sexpot. I think that's All Miley All The Way,\" she wrote.</p><p>Cyrus finally waded in with her ill-advised tweet mocking O'Connor's mental state, before <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MileyCyrus/status/385917041452277760\" title=\"\">also tweeting</a>: \"Sinead. I don't have time to write you an open letter cause I'm hosting &amp; performing on SNL this week.\"</p><p>It was enough to goad O'Connor into replying angrily on her Facebook page: \"Really? Who the fuck is advising you? Because taking me on is even more fuckin' stupid than behaving like a prostitute and calling it feminism.\" She added: \"When you end up in the psych ward or rehab I'll be happy to visit you … and would not lower myself to mock you. Be a proper woman and make the public apologies I have listed above.\"</p><p>Last, and considerably least, Terry Richardson has timed this controversy with a post that features a <a href=\"http://terrysdiary.com/post/63002078079/miley-cyrus-in-nyc-22\" title=\"\">string of images</a> of Cyrus posing in thong leotards, smoking and licking a large ice cream.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419074077|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|8def781a0b1d2963709d6f4adef3f93b3e3a8321 -->",

        "body":"<p>They have surrendered: Morrissey's memoir is indeed coming out, and will be published by Penguin Classics, the home of some of the world's greatest literary works.</p><p>Morrissey <a href=\"http://true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_131003_01\" title=\"\">announced on Thursday</a> that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/19/morrissey-missing-memoir-autobiography-due-weeks\" title=\"\">after much vacillation</a>, Penguin Classics will publish the book on 17 October. According to Morrissey's statement, which was verified by the publisher, Autobiography will come out in the UK, Europe and the British Commonwealth. Reps for the former Smiths frontman stated that the star \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/19/morrissey-missing-memoir-autobiography-due-weeks\" title=\"\">has no contract with a publisher for the US or any other territory</a>\". This may be the result of a reported conflict with Penguin's international subsidiaries: in September, the fansite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/13/morrissey-autobiography-collapse-fan-site\" title=\"\">True to You claimed</a> \"a last-minute content disagreement … caused the [Penguin] venture to collapse\".</p><p>Morrissey has spent years working on the book. As early as 2011, he said the principal manuscript was finished: \"I've reached the redrafting, trimming stage,\" he said of a 660-page draft. \"I'd like it to go to Penguin, but only if they published it as a Classic,\" he told Radio 4's Front Row at the time. \"I can't see why not – a contemporary Penguin Classic. When you consider what really hits print these days, and when you look at the autobiographies and how they are sold, most of it is appalling. It's a publishing event, not a literary event.\"</p><p>Although the book has been a long time coming, a representative for Waterstones, Jon Howells, predicts that the memoir will be a success this Christmas: \"He's a contrary, controversial character, and his is arguably the most interesting untold story yet to emerge from the 80s generation of British music heroes. The announcement may have not been as smooth as the publisher would have hoped, but ultimately fans just want to read it, and we expect Autobiography to be one of this Christmas's top sellers at Waterstones.\"</p><p>While Penguin Classics is usually an imprint for work by long-beloved (and long-dead) members of the literary canon, the publishing house is a \"natural fit\" for Morrissey, a Penguin spokesperson <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/smiths-bidding-war-hinges-on-classic-status-2272620.html\" title=\"\">said in 2011</a>. With the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/smiths-bidding-war-hinges-on-classic-status-2272620.html\" title=\"\">Independent</a> reporting that the contract \"hinged\" on whether the memoir would be declared a Classic, Penguin's rep explained: \"[It] could be published as a Penguin Classic because it is a classic in the making.\"</p><p>The statement from Penguin Classics revealed the book's cover – <a href=\"http://rokpool.com/files/artist/morrissey-cover.jpg?0\" title=\"\">a photograph used for Morrissey's 2008 Greatest Hits</a>. It also includes the quote: \"Most pop stars have to be dead before they reach the iconic status that Morrissey has reached in his lifetime\" – a declaration that may or may not have been written by the singer himself.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419054052|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|0b04e6b1f0fd4b3abbf341a00fb6082013313235 -->",

        "headline":"My Bloody Valentine's Kevin Shields: 'I play through the pain'",
        "body":"<p>The early-evening crowd in this cosy central London pub have no idea that a sonic sorcerer stands in their midst. His outward appearance offers few clues: mop of fag-ash-coloured curls, unspectacular spectacles, sturdy cagoule and sensible trousers. Little about Kevin Shields' gentle demeanour suggests he creates magical, mind-melting music that drives people to have uninhibited sex, guzzle weapons-grade drugs and soil themselves. Of which more shortly.</p><p>For now, he leans on the bar – a big man, XL T-shirt – and, in a soft Irish accent, orders himself a small gin and tonic and a bottle of mineral water. &quot;Funny meeting a strange guy in a bar,&quot; he murmurs, giving an indication that he rarely grants interviews.</p><p>Before the interview begins, Shields offers up some small talk: how seeing the Ramones in a north-Dublin cinema changed his life; why he enjoyed contributing towards the Lost in Translation soundtrack (&quot;lovely people&quot;); how he always found Gary Glitter creepy (&quot;with his big hairy chest&quot;). At 50, Shields' life divides into three movements: he spent his first 10 years in Queens, New York, the next decade in Dublin and the remaining time in London. He doesn't have any kids – &quot;I'd like them though.&quot;</p><p>Shields, it transpires, is a passionate, sometimes bewildering, conversationalist. The next two hours glide by as he discusses decibel levels, corporate control and the collective unconscious. His thoughts come in great torrents, swirl through the filters, then emerge retooled and refined. It's like a spoken word concert by My Bloody Valentine, the band he has helmed for the past 30 years. Yet it's mildly surprising he has shown up at all, let alone on time. He rarely gives interviews, and punctuality isn't a concept he embraces warmly.</p><p>His working methods similarly defy conventional scheduling. My Bloody Valentine's second album, 1991's Loveless, required two years and an estimated &pound;250,000 to complete.</p><p>&quot;I would say I'm patient rather than stubborn,&quot; Shields says of his difficult reputation. &quot;I just want to produce the best music I can and if events conspire to interrupt that process or the circumstances aren't conducive then I just stop ... and wait. But how can I be stubborn about my own work? I want to do it. But when I know I can do something really good I will wait 10 years to do it.&quot;</p><p>It is said that during the making of Loveless, such was Shields' singularity, that Creation Records' bigwigs Dick Green and Alan McGee – to whom Shields was contracted – went grey and bald respectively overnight. &quot;That wasn't my doing and I'm sure it didn't happen,&quot; Shields shrugs. &quot;But wouldn't that be a great power to have?&quot; He chuckles, then his jaw muscles bunch. &quot;You know, people shouldn't sign bands like us if they don't want to take on that responsibility. It's like getting a pack of big dogs and not feeding them. We were taken on ... carelessly. I just wanted to focus on music but McGee and Green hadn't encountered someone like me before, a person that they couldn't control.&quot;</p><p>Wilful is the word you hear. Like Scott Walker and Mark Hollis, Shields is one of the few contemporary artists who marches to the beat of his own drum. But his vision has claimed victims: Shields has seen more breakdowns than an AA man. And if the making of Loveless was a song and dance, then the protracted process that led to its follow-up was a fully fledged fandango. Seventeen years in the making, m b v was released in February this year and was worth its wait in gold.</p><p>A poignant and powerful piece, m b v often bears closer comparison to abstract impressionist painters such as Mark Rothko. He is trying, Shields says, to convey &quot;feelings above ideas&quot;. Every nuance and shadow of his music is minutely considered. Each frond of feedback lovingly tended. &quot;And that stuff takes time,&quot; he smiles.</p><p>But when it is jokingly suggested that, had Shields released m b v in 1994, as initially planned, he could have kiboshed Britpop, his mood changes. &quot;Britpop was massively pushed by the government,&quot; he says. &quot;Someday it would be interesting to read all the MI5 files on Britpop. The wool was pulled right over everyone's eyes there.&quot;</p><p>So had he been invited to Downing Street during the swinging 90s, how would he have responded? &quot;I would have agreed to go on condition that we could play a song,&quot; he says with a hint of menace. He's referring to MBV's formidable live sound. One reviewer complained that the experience had more in common with torture than entertainment. And while their shows are exceptionally loud – earplugs are given out (&quot;it is not cool to damage your senses&quot;) – this is no heavy-metal bludgeoning. There are frequencies at play and physical energies shifting that do more than merely caramelise your vital organs.</p><p>&quot;If you want to hear music played quietly, that's what record players are for,&quot; he says before conceding: &quot;Back in 2008 we were very loud. It was kind of an experiment, something we'd always wanted to do. I heard people were coming out of those gigs looking like they'd just witnessed a car accident. But in a world where blandness and OK-ness is a dominant factor, to do anything that's a real experience is a positive thing.&quot;</p><p>Not so for the unfortunate soul in the lavatories at London's Town &amp; Country Club on 15 December 1991. As MBV concluded their set with what they once termed the &quot;holocaust section&quot; of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GcdtkSPdPw\" title=\"\">You Made Me Realise</a> (read: punishing audio/eye-frying lights), a dismayed audience member realised that the pulverising sound had caused him to soil himself.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419062376\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380815701539/My-Bloody-Valentine-1990s-008.jpg\" alt=\"My Bloody Valentine 1990s.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>My Bloody Valentine in the 1990s. Photograph: CAMERA PRESS/Steve Double</figcaption></figure><p>&quot;That can happen,&quot; sniffs Shields. &quot;Although that's a very small percentage when you think about it: one person out of maybe 2,000. But there's always someone who'll shit themselves at the slightest excuse.&quot;</p><p>As if on cue, a sloshed suit squeezes past Shields en route to the gents. Shields apologises politely, interrupting as he does an impressive discourse on punk's post-1977 years. It's something he's quite the expert on: this, after all, was the era where punk underwent an industrial rethink and MBV's sound was forged. He eulogises pioneering Pil guitarist Keith Levene (&quot;just sublime and utterly without ego&quot;) and Killing Joke's Geordie Walker (&quot;this effortless playing producing a monstrous sound&quot;). He even has a soft spot for the Cockney Rejects, pugnacious purveyors of football singalongs. &quot;Great guitar,&quot; he marvels, fingering a bar-chord air riff. &quot;And always for the greater good of the song.&quot;</p><p>This fondness for heads-down, balls-out boogie may help explain Shields' uncharacteristic extracurricular activities. Whereas resting rock stars traditionally retreat to Mustique to recharge their creative batteries or plan a dazzling electronic project with some Canadian, Shields took a sabbatical from My Bloody Valentine and went on tour with Primal Scream. A wise move in retrospect?</p><p>&quot;Yes and no. I mean, I was terrible in my 30s. I did some silly, crazy things. That's when I really went for it in every respect. Taking drugs recreationally – lots of them. So it's all very hazy and jumbled up. I can remember the beginning and the last few gigs with Primal Scream but everything else is interchangeable.</p><p>&quot;I once took down the name of every single member of staff on an aeroplane because I was so fucking drunk. I found this illegible piece of paper in my pocket the next day and couldn't work out what it was. I'd blacked out. But now I'm a more convivial drinker – I don't get really drunk. I still have a few pints of gin and tonic before I go onstage but nothing stupid.&quot;</p><p>Thirty years at the glittering coalface of alternative rock has finally provided security for Shields (&quot;I've been OK for money since about 2008&quot;), but has taken its toll spiritually and bodily. Periods of seclusion and depression have invited parallels with his hero Brian Wilson. And while his work was always painstaking, it has also become painful.</p><p>Shields suffers from tinnitus (&quot;it varies from mild to extreme&quot;) and has tendonitis in his fretting hand. He dismisses these conditions philosophically – &quot;It's part of the job and we're all going to die anyway&quot; – but when the tinnitus struck for the first time during the mixing of Loveless, he feared for his ears.</p><p>&quot;Initially, I was worried,&quot; he admits. &quot;But I've come to treat the tinnitus as a friend. It filters unwanted sounds and actually protects my ears. It becomes your first line of defence against audible stress. I'm not boasting because my hearing has always been average but I hear things that a lot of people don't hear. That part of my brain that processes sound works a lot harder than average.</p><p>&quot;With the hand,&quot; he says, extending his long left thumb, &quot;I kind of play through the pain and it stops. I ignore it. Once you start to immerse yourself in the sound, any discomfort just disappears.&quot;</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-419062377\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380815866543/The-band-on-tour-in-1991.-008.jpg\" alt=\"The band on tour in 1991.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>The band on tour in 1991. Photograph: Hulton Archive</figcaption></figure><p>Precisely how Shields achieves his queasy, waking-state guitar sound has long been the subject of stubbly examination. &quot;A very loose taped-up tremolo arm on a Fender Jazzmaster, open chording and a few effects,&quot; is as far as he will be drawn. &quot;It just happens. It's really like magic. It's more the zone, the meditative state I get into. It has very emotional connotations for me. I have to keep very still when I'm playing. I can't explain it. It is magic.</p><p>&quot;I see music,&quot; he adds. &quot;I remember music visually rather than sonically. Colours and shapes moving through each other.&quot;</p><p>And how would Shields, a control freak – let's be frank – prefer people listened to his recorded output?</p><p>&quot;However they like!&quot; he says, before reconsidering. &quot;But perhaps not with headphones. It wasn't made to be listened to on headphones.&quot;</p><p>Is it true that MBV's music makes a good accompaniment to sex? &quot;People have said that,&quot; he nods. &quot;It's sensuous. Sensuality has informed a lot of what we do.&quot;</p><p>Has he ever had sex to his own music? &quot;Not on purpose, put it that way,&quot; he says with a grin. &quot;Although our music is not so great on acid. It's too dense, I think. It doesn't have that acidy space context. It was always more of an ecstasy thing.&quot;</p><p>With all the drugs, the psychological pressure and physical pain, the psyche-scouring, the perfectionist production values, the pints of gin and tonic, has Shields ever worried that he might lose his mind?</p><p>&quot;I purposely melted my mind,&quot; he says. &quot;It felt like a way of seeing the world in a different way from normal. It's complicated but I explored the nature of consciousness. I attempted to tune into the Earth's frequency – which is about seven hertz, I think. It sounds like a load of shit. But I've been searching my inner self, I suppose. And it's made me stronger. I think you can hear that in the music.&quot;</p><p>If you worry that one of music's chief noiseniks is getting a bit hippy-dippy then Shields soon dispels such fears. Abruptly detuning from the elemental megahertz, he launches into a seething diatribe against the Mercury awards and their reluctance to acknowledge &quot;truly independent artists&quot;.</p><p>m b v was, apparently, not even considered for a Mercury nomination on the grounds that qualifying albums had to have &quot;a digital and physical distribution deal in place in the UK&quot;. m b v was self-released, with the digital version available only through the band's own website. &quot;In their eyes,&quot; he concludes, after a lengthy, comma-free rant, &quot;what we're doing is illegal. Not within 'the rules'. We don't exist.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There are sinister forces at work,&quot; he adds. &quot;Our freedom is diminishing. The rightwing is creeping in like water. That's got to stop.&quot; Then, zipping his cagoule purposefully, this sonic sorcerer and eccentric sweetheart issues a parting shot.</p><p>&quot;Personally,&quot; he smiles. &quot;I intend to react to it most disrespectfully.&quot;</p><h2>My Bloody Valentine: essential tracks</h2><p><strong>1.

        "headline":"National Wake: the South African punk band who defied apartheid",
        "body":"<p>A couple of years ago, an LA-based recording studio designer called Ivan Kadey went to a screening of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147796/searching-for-sugar-man\" title=\"\">Searching for Sugar Man</a>, the Oscar-winning documentary about singer-songwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/15/searching-sugar-man-sixto-rodriguez\" title=\"\">Sixto Rodriguez</a> and his long-standing fame in South Africa. He enjoyed the film, but something about it bothered him. After the discussion that followed the screening, Kadey felt impelled to go up to one of the panel members, Matt Sullivan, of Rodriguez's US label Light in the Attic. \"I said, you know, this is a great story, and it's true what Rodriguez meant to us. But they talk about there being no protest music in South Africa in the 70s and 80s, it's just not right. I was in a pretty interesting band in Johannesburg.\"</p><p>Pretty interesting turned out to be a dramatic understatement. National Wake, the band Kadey led in the late 70s and early 80s, were South Africa's first, and indeed only, multiracial punk band. And yet Kadey had kept this unique story to himself, partly because he thought no one was interested (National Wake split in 1982 just after putting out their solitary release, an album of which only 500 copies were pressed) but also, Kadey says, because \"it was too painful for me, so I just buried it\". The band's two black members, brothers Gary and Punka Khoza had subsequently died: the former had struggled with mental illness and killed himself; the latter died from an Aids-related illness. \"He was just one of the myriad South Africans who contracted AIDS and didn't get any real treatment because of that whole fuck-up.\" Furthermore, Kadey thought his band had failed precisely because no one knew about them: their message hadn't got across. \"We'd started with a vision that this was actually a way to move to something much brighter, a better South Africa. We dreamed that we were going to transcend all the bullshit and that people would hear our stuff and it would happen.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFXVt95_o-Y\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video</a></p><p>The band had grown out of a Johannesburg commune that Kadey lived in during the mid-70s. \"It wasn't uncommon forpeople to live in communes in South Africa at that time, although what was uncommon was that we actually had people from a different races living together, in a white area. Occasionally, the police would break in and harass everyone, threaten arrest. They'd have had reports that we were smoking marijuana, or that there was a black guy living in the house and they'd come to find him – he was actually hiding in someone's bed who he was sleeping with, she had him tucked under the covers. Ridiculous stories. We'd just decided that we were going to live our lives in a post-apartheid way, in spite of, or with no regard for, all the laws that were set up to govern the way we were supposed to relate.\"</p><p>Kadey formed National Wake in the aftermath of the Soweto uprising of 1976 – \"one of the conditions of living in a repressive state like that is that it just seems impossible to do anything about it, there's a kind of paralysis, but that was a real 'get up, stand up' moment: look at these kids, it's time to take up the fight\" – their sound influenced by British and American punk and Bob Marley. It seems astonishing that the latter's music was even available in apartheid South Africa: you'd think the first thing a white supremacist government would censor would be a Rastafarian preaching pan-African solidarity and black power. \"Well, they weren't hip, take it from me,\" he chuckles. \"They couldn't control everything. There were record stores – not many, but one in each town – bringing in all sorts of stuff: The Last Poets, Linton Kwesi Johnson.\"</p><p>But if the South African authorities had somehow managed to overlook Bob Marley, they didn't miss National Wake, whose songs didn't exactly cloak their political message in layers of impenetrable metaphor. In three minutes, the band's signature tune International News manages to decry state censorship, the war in Angola and what guitarist Steve Moni calls \"the ostrich life of suburban South Africa, just spending your time deliberately trying not to notice things\". They developed a following around Johannesburg, despite club owners frequently electing to close their venues altogether rather than let them play. But when they attempted to join other new wave bands on a national tour called Riot Rock, they discovered the promoters had, as Kadey puts it, \"got very, very worried about hosting this multiracial band\" and applied to the government for permission. \"And of course it was refused. When we arrived, they said we couldn't play and I was adamant that we would. We actually played three gigs on that tour. The fourth gig was in Fish Hoek, very conservative, and they totally lost their nerve, they'd forbidden us, absolutely, to play. We walked onstage, plugged in and took off and they pulled the plug within 10 seconds.\"</p><p>They seem to have been viewed with a certain awe even by rival punk bands: \"They had an aura, like wanted men,\" says Michael Flek, frontman of South Africa's first punk band Wild Youth. \"When they showed up it was like the revolutionaries had arrived\".  But the pressure of existing in what Moni describes as \"a thin grey area between what was legal and what wasn't\" wore on the band the more successful they became. The house they lived in was under constant surveillance. Eventually, the police told them to leave the country altogether. \"We were called into an interview at Hillbrow police station with a very sinister cop, plain clothes,\" says Kadey. \"He told us: 'Listen, you guys should go overseas, call yourselves Exile, you'll make a fortune.' He presented it as career advice, but you knew what he was saying: we're watching you guys, maybe you should fuck off.\"</p><p>\"You were living on your wits a lot of the time, constant adrenaline,\" says Moni. \"It was very stressful. You know, you were young, you were pushing the envelope a bit, but it was dangerous too, I guess. Not just because of the police. We played in townships after midnight and there were black people there who didn't think it was cool for black guys to be playing with white guys under that regime. It was pretty treacherous all round.\"</p><p>They were, Moni says, astounded to be offered a record deal with Warner Brothers. Recorded virtually live in a couple of nights, their eponymous album was released in 1981: \"Of course, it had been stripped of its more contentious numbers and the lyric sheet was partly blacked out,\" says Moni. \"We left it like that, to show it had been severely hacked.\" Despite a limited pressing, it got a good reaction. They found themselves booked to perform at \"the premiere showcase for bands in the country\", a Johannesburg club called The Chelsea. \"All the people interested in what was happening in rock and roll came to see us,\" says Kadey. \"But unfortunately the venue was very strict on race segregation, so it was an absolute bummer.\" The indignity of performing in front of segregated audiences was the final straw for bass player Gary Khoza: \"His spirit was just hammered,\" says Kadey. He quit and the band fell apart. Moni left South Africa for Europe; after years running a mobile studio, Kadey followed suit, emigrating to the US.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419056785'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380823230017/Telegram-010.jpg' alt='Telegram' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A telegram explaining that an application for a permit for National Wake to play has 'not been favourably considered'. Photograph: Courtesy of Ivan Kadey/Light in the Attic Records</figcaption></figure><p>That should have been that, but as it turned out, Kadey was wrong about National Wake being forgotten: their music had a strange afterlife on bootleg tapes. Around the same time he told his story to the guy from Rodriguez's record label – Light In The Attic is about to release a 14-track <a href=\"http://lightintheattic.net/releases/923-walk-in-africa-1979-81\" title=\"\">National Wake compilation entitled National Wake Walk in Africa</a> – he was approached by film-makers, who wanted to shoot a documentary about punk in Africa. \"One of the driving forces behind the movie told me National Wake's music had saved his life. He was a conscript in the army, fighting across the border in Angola and he was listening to National Wake on his headphones. The music had spread and I honestly didn't&nbsp;know.\"</p><p>He's justifiably proud of the music on the Walk in Africa compilation, if a little surprised by the reaction both abroad and back home. \"<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.co.za\" title=\"\">South African Rolling Stone</a> did an article headlined Everybody Loves Freedom: The Rediscovery of National Wake,\" he says. \"That's a lyric from a song the Khoza brothers wrote. Those guys were so amazingly firm and steadfast, that's how black South Africans were. I spoke to their sister today. I said, look at this: Gary and Punka's words are finally being read and heard loud and clear in South Africa. It's a great day. It really is.\"</p><p><em>National Wake 'Walk In Africa 1979-81 is released on Monday on Light In The Attic</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418994133|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|43172f84329e033f5a7f930bf410ff7ad024c10c -->",

        "body":"<p>\"I can't hear you Manchester,\" yells Jay Z, and for a moment you fear he may have actually gone deaf. With an incredible racket coming from the crowd and stage, thousands of hands rising and falling as if in prayer and the man in black with a huge cross daubed on his back, this is hip-hop as a deafening, almost religious experience.</p><p>A decade after his three-year \"worst retirement in history\", Jay Z isn't just louder, but bigger and busier. There's the alcohol brand, the perfume and lately the sports agency. He may be 43 now but has lost none of his chutzpah. Current album Magna Carta Holy Grail manages a pun on his real name (Shawn Carter), while the blistering flow that documented the hard knock life in Brooklyn now traces his trajectory into domesticity, frets about fatherhood, marriage (to Beyoncé Knowles), art collecting and a net worth of a reported half a billion dollars.</p><p>The street life to the high life is now the classic trajectory of what started as ghetto music, but Carter is mapping it more dramatically than anyone. Perhaps being bigger and brasher than the rest is Jay Z's way of confronting his – and hip-hop's – looming middle age. He was one the genre's first artists to recognise that the live shows had to offer more than turntables and a microphone, and puts on a show to cut it in the biggest arenas.</p><p>There are multiple TV screens, musicians in cages, visual  explosions and that relentless volume. There is plenty of bravado – it's hard to think of many rappers who could suggest \"making love on a million in a dirty hotel\" and have the wherewithal to put it into practice. His rollercoasting storytelling manages to take in the BP oil spill, the state of America and \"Miley Cyrus, twerking\". However, at least as fascinating are the tantalising glimpses of humanity, vulnerability and even insecurity behind the global machine.</p><p>He seems to sweat more than he used to. The constant requests to \"make some noise\" seem to seek reassurance. He has clearly pondered what would happen if everything went wrong (\"I could die from the fall\") and, even after a costume change, there's at least one moment where he visibly has to catch his breath.</p><p>However, when that microphone is raised, his flow is as blistering as ever. Spontaneous cheering erupts when a particularly dizzying blast ends with \"the originator, none greater\". Some reckon his best work is behind him, but the new Oceans (with the recorded singing of Frank Ocean) tells of the waters that brought the first slaves from Africa and is supernaturally moving.</p><p>He doesn't spare the oldies, though. In a career-spanning two-hour marathon, Big Pimpin' turns the arena into a flag-waving carnival while 99 Problems turns from a cappella tease into full metal racket. There's even dry humour after Empire State Of Mind (\"Not bad at all\").</p><p>This stadium-sized hip-hop is a long way from where the music started, and he recently joked about being the \"Rolling Stones of rap\". He's certainly got the finance, but you wonder where he can take the music as he ages. If he can do that and remain relevant, Mr Carter will be more than entitled to compare himself to Mick and Keith.</p><p><em>At Manchester Arena and touring</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419017988|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|5112f9979babe4477a6de073808c8bdbebc5b9d6 -->",
