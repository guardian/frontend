And each Juicero machine is priced at $699 (£490), with <a href=\"https://www.juicero.com/the-packs/\">each pouch of fruit and veg costing between $5 and $7</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who on earth would be willing to pay that much for a juicer that commits them to spending a fiver each time they make a glass of juice?</strong><a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-is-juicero-and-how-does-it-work-2016-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\"> Gwyneth Paltrow loves it, apparently</a>.</p> <p><strong>Of course she does. How about anyone non-rich? </strong>We’re about to find out. “Juicero makes it easy to get your nutritious dose of fresh, raw, organic fruits and vegetables,” the company explains.</p> <p><strong>I didn’t realise it was hard. Don’t you just buy some and eat them?</strong> I suppose you might.</p> <p><strong>Or you could buy cartons of juice, or get one of those Nutribullet blenders that people seem to like?</strong> I suppose. But who has time to actually buy and rinse things? Instead, with Juicero, you just take a packet of sealed ingredients out of the fridge and hang it in your machine, which reads a QR code on the back, determines that it’s fresh, and squeezes it incredibly hard, sending all the juice into a glass below. Then you just chuck the pack into landfill – or cut it open with scissors, scrape out the old pulp, rinse it clean, and put it in the recycling.</p> <p><strong>I see … So it’s like mindbendingly expensive coffee pods for juice, then?</strong> Almost exactly like that, yes. Venture capitalists expect it to “disrupt” the home-juicing market.</p> <p><strong>Do what to the what, now?</strong> Make people unhappy with the juicers they already have.</p> <p><strong>Ah. Except the crackpots who actually eat fruit and vegetables? They won’t care, right? </strong>Yeah. Those weirdos are in a world of their own.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Think of us as your personal juicing sous chef.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Think of us when we go bust.”</p>","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeb7664e6ad9d7bf9eb37a103b83da99ea9aa31d\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/aeb7664e6ad9d7bf9eb37a103b83da99ea9aa31d/0_0_7320_5484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fad gadget … WiFi-enabled cold-press Juicero\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fad gadget … the WiFi-enabled, cold-press Juicero</span> </figcaption> </figure>","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4t32j","wordcount":"410","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeb7664e6ad9d7bf9eb37a103b83da99ea9aa31d/0_565_7320_4388/500.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56fe8621e4b099ddc2fa2aa8","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2016-04-09T13:58:00Z","standfirst":"Too busy to cut carrots or wash up?

1984.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> This coming August.</p> <p><strong>Didn’t you just say he was dead? </strong>Yes, but the movie of his life is scheduled for release in August.</p> <p><strong>I see. And who was Ray Kroc?</strong> He was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kroc\" title=\"\">founder of the McDonald’s fast-food empire</a>.</p> <p><strong>I thought a clown founded McDonald’s?</strong> No, the clown came later. In <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4276820/\" title=\"\">The Founder</a>, Kroc will be played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/spotlight\" title=\"\">Spotlight</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/birdman\" title=\"\">Birdman</a> star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-keaton\" title=\"\">Michael Keaton</a>.</p> <p><strong>If he was the founder, why isn’t McDonald’s called Kroc’s? </strong>Well, to be fair, he wasn’t quite the founder. It’s an interesting story, actually.</p> <p><strong>Are you going to tell it? </strong>Not without first issuing a SPOILER ALERT.</p> <p><strong>I’m alerted. </strong>OK, then. Having lied about his age (15) in order to drive ambulances during the first world war, Kroc later found work as a paper-cup salesman, musician and radio DJ.</p> <p><strong>Uh-huh. </strong>Then, in 1954, while working as a travelling milkshake-mixer salesman, Kroc visited a successful California burger joint run by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald.</p> <p><strong>Ah-ha! </strong>Impressed by the efficiency of their operation – limited menu, factory-line cooking, no waiters – Kroc offered to franchise the system nationwide. The brothers agreed, and by 1958 McDonald’s had sold 100m burgers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7d060beebd3984838e05252dd39a52d20a672a0\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c7d060beebd3984838e05252dd39a52d20a672a0/0_157_2096_1257/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Kroc, right, with McDonald’s executive Fred Turner in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ray Kroc, right, with McDonald’s executive Fred Turner in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I do love a happy ending. </strong>Well, Kroc’s ambitions for the business consistently outstripped those of the more cautious McDonalds. In 1961, the brothers agreed to sell the company to Kroc, but fell out badly with him during negotiations.</p> <p><strong>What went wrong? </strong>It depends who you ask. Kroc reportedly reneged on a handshake royalty agreement. He was said to be angry because the McDonalds had refused to surrender their original, highly profitable San Bernadino restaurant to him, which they renamed M’s.</p> <p><strong>You win some, you lose some. </strong>Not Kroc: he opened a McDonald’s outlet nearby and drove them out of business.</p> <p><strong>So, it’s another story of a rapacious capitalist burning bridges in order to create a global corporate behemoth? </strong>Up to a point – Kroc retired in 1976 to concentrate on the San Diego Padres baseball team, which he had bought two years previously.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I’m sure a warts’n’all biopic of such a figure could be fascinating, even if I can’t quite see how.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“How’s the Happy Meal tie-in deal progressing?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11397243","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2481196","internalRevision":"53","publication":"The

ageless.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Immaterial. Geddit?</p> <p><strong>Ah, wait, I know this one! Is it clean eating until you look like a ghost? Or die of boredom and actually become a ghost? </strong>No. It’s when you’re going out with someone and then you just … don’t, any more. You stop returning calls, texts, emails and basically unilaterally absent yourself from the relationship. Which is now no relationship. Because you’re not there. Like a ghost. A cruel, cowardly, morally repugnant ghost.</p> <p><strong>That’s scarier than any ghoulish phantom. </strong>I know.

I mean, in this digital age, aren’t we all just pixellated shadows of ourselves anyway? Why not ghost when you have no real connection?

No one has noticed yet.

I just can’t be arsed. </strong>Some people do it because it saves the host being interrupted a million times by people bidding farewell. The party can keep running smoothly.</p> <p><strong>That’s nice. I do it because I suddenly become so overwhelmed by the fact that I’m out, with people infinitely more capable of having fun than I, and music, and talking, and noise and people that I have to go before I kill. </strong>You’re a spectre at the feast before you ghost.

what’s behind the botanical spirit boom?","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-28T14:38:32Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Gin.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Oh, you know, 900 years old, or something.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Crystal clear.</p> <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Water, alcohol, juniper berries, a little of what you fancy.</p> <p><strong>I fancy vodka.</strong> Well, gin is basically just vodka flavoured with botanicals.</p> <p><strong>What are botanicals?</strong> Flavourings.</p> <p><strong>Oh. </strong>Besides juniper, people sometimes use lemon peel, coriander, aniseed, caraway, dill, rose ...</p> <p><strong>I get the picture. </strong>Gin’s origins are obscure, but it almost certainly began as jenever in the medieval Low Countries. By the 18th century, it was big in Britain – too big, in fact, leading to London’s deadly gin craze. That was <a href=\"http://www.ginfoundry.com/gin/sipsmith-gin/\" title=\"\">controlled by licensing laws</a>, but now gin is back, baby!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2016/mar/15/new-wave-gin-tonic-contemporary-revival-spirit-craft-beer\">New-wave gin is just the tonic for contemporary drinkers</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Evidence, please.</strong> According to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, sales of gin are expected to exceed £1bn in Britain this year; <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/shopping-and-consumer-news/12205632/Britains-love-of-gin-sees-number-of-UK-distilleries-double.html\" title=\"\">49 distilleries opened last year alone</a>. There are now more than twice as many distilleries as there were in 2010, when the government changed rules that made it difficult for craft gin-makers to set up shop.</p> <p><strong>Sorry, did you say “craft gin”? </strong>I did indeed. It’s the next trendy thing after craft beer, with prices similar to posh whisky. Gin is having a moment, you see, perhaps even a movement.</p> <p><strong>But how can gin be trendy? I thought it was incredibly old-fashioned, the sort of thing drunk by sozzled colonels and their memsahibs? </strong>Yeah, but old-fashioned is trendy now, haven’t you noticed? That’s why people like beards, battered industrial furniture and naming their children Horace and Edna.</p> <p><strong>I have noticed that people on the internet always list gin among their hobbies, along with cats, cake and tea. </strong>Precisely. What could be more sophisticated than ironic quaintness? Plus, gin is nice.</p> <p><strong>Mmm. </strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/news/gin-crisis/\" title=\"\">Although it is under threat</a>.</p> <p><strong>What? I thought you told me it was having a moment? </strong>It is, but so is <em>Phytophthora austrocedri</em>, a fungus-like pathogen that is killing Scottish juniper trees. It was first detected in Britain in 2011.</p> <p><strong>So, this pathogen likes the taste of juniper even more than hipsters do? </strong>It actually attacks the roots, but yes. In a few years, any distillers wanting to use domestic juniper berries might have trouble finding any.</p> <p><strong>So, there might be a shortage of locally foraged craft gin? </strong>I fear so. Try not to spread panic.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Ice and a slice?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Slow-frozen wild glacier crystals and unwaxed Sicilian lemon?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11390680","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-29T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2479917","internalRevision":"63","publication":"The

so dumb after all: study says blond women are more intelligent","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-23T16:29:11Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name: </strong>Blondes.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> About 11,000 years old, genetically.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Just fabulous!</p> <p><strong>There you go, perpetuating the dumb-blond stereotype! I thought Reese Witherspoon had dealt with this in that civil rights documentary?</strong> Legally Blonde?</p> <p><strong>That’s the one.</strong> I don’t think that was a documentary. Besides, I’m not here to perpetuate anything. Rather the opposite in fact, because <a href=\"http://www.accessecon.com/Pubs/EB/2016/Volume36/EB-16-V36-I1-P42.pdf\">new research in the US</a> suggests that naturally blond women are no dumber than anybody else. Indeed, they may be cleverer in some ways.</p> <p><strong>Woo-hoo! In your face, non-blondes! Let me feast on the details. </strong>Well, the study used old data from a long-running national survey conducted regularly on 10,878 ordinary Americans who were aged 14-22 in 1979.</p> <p><strong>OK. </strong>Participants were given a kind of intelligence test, and at one point were also asked their natural hair colour. Based on this data, after various statistical adjustments, blond and brown-haired white women, on average, had an IQ a couple of points higher than white women with red or black hair.</p> <p><strong>Yeah! </strong>Blond and brown-haired women were also quite a bit more likely to be at the “genius level”, with an IQ of more than 125.</p> <p><strong>Kiss my underpigmentation! </strong>Except …</p> <p><strong>Oh, here we go. </strong>Except, there are rather a lot of problems when you look deeper. For one thing, more than 93% of all white women said they had either blond or brown hair, so it is hardly a distinction to be one of them. The data on the other women looks a bit shaky too, since it’s based on just 195 answers.</p> <p><strong>Right.</strong> Also, there seem to be more blond women than blond men in the survey, which there shouldn’t be, so bleach or wishful thinking have probably interfered there.</p> <p><strong>Fine. </strong>In any case, general intelligence is a very slippery thing to measure, as it may well be influenced a lot by how you are brought up. For instance, as the study points out, the big survey also shows: “White, blond women grew up in homes with more reading material than those with other hair colour.” And indeed, according to this survey, men generally are cleverer than women.</p> <p><strong>Oh, well, clearly it’s a load of nonsense then.</strong> I think I agree.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“According to this dataset, blondes have 2.63% more fun.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Clearly, blond people should rule the world.

It’s one up from the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/03/thigh-gap-pressure-point-women-self-esteem\"><strong>thigh gap</strong></a><strong>, the </strong><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10563823/Bikini-Bridge-hoax-how-the-internet-ate-itself.html\"><strong>bikini bridge</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/mons-pubis-becomes-new-thigh-gap-after-si-swimsuit-cover-spurs-surgeries-322722?utm_content=buffera6764&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\"><strong>whatever they hashtagged the mons pubis</strong></a><strong> during those six weeks when everyone thought that was the new fatty site of interest.</strong> No, not quite.</p> <p><strong>Oh. What, then?</strong> Demand is growing among men for varicose vein removal. They wish to wear shorts, and go cycling and swimming without feeling self-conscious about their knotty blue legs.</p> <p><strong>Never say “knotty blue legs” to me again. </strong>OK, sorry. But that’s what’s happening. A Staffordshire clinic says that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/21/body-conscious-men-prompt-rise-in-varicose-vein-treatments/\">men now account for a third of its patients</a>, up from a fifth in 2012.</p> <p><strong>Vanity, thy name is Clive! </strong>Why Clive?</p> <p><strong>I don’t know. I hear “shorts” and “knotty blue legs”, and I think “Clive”. </strong>I see.</p> <p><strong>I should have just gone with “How vein!” </strong>I think maybe, yes.</p> <p><strong>Isn’t it a massive operation? I remember when my actual grandpa had his done. It was a general-anaesthetic-and-weeks-of-recovery job. </strong>The technology has improved since days of vascular yore. It’s now usually laser treatment under a local anaesthetic. You can get it done in your lunch hour.</p> <p><strong>And still have time for a sandwich? </strong>I don’t know about the sandwich. But if you’re getting your legs lasered to look good in shorts, you’re probably off carbs anyway.</p> <p><strong>Good point. So, is this progress? Men starting to feel insecure about their looks as women have done for centuries? Or is it not?</strong> It is not.</p> <p><strong>That was easy.</strong> Progress is not to be measured in the increase of neuroses or the indulgence of absurd vanities. It is to be measured in the pumping of healthy blood through healthy veins into active, joyful old age, not the ripping out of body parts to serve a mindless new aesthetic.</p> <p><strong>I see. </strong>Also, missing out on your sandwich at lunchtime is just stupid.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“I love an intact circulatory system in a man!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I don’t like to be able to see it pulsing away just under the skin, though – sort it out, could you?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11372658","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-23T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2477330","internalRevision":"39","publication":"The

In fact, these pests can quickly defoliate an entire box hedge, and are now doing so all over the south of England.</p> <p><strong>Is a box hedge a hedge in the shape of a box?</strong> Often, although box (or buxus) is <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=88\" title=\"\">really the name of the type of shrub</a> that is frequently clipped into formal squares, topiary animals, mazes and so on.</p> <p><strong>Yes, my garden in the south of England has several of those. So, how come they’re only being chomped by these caterpillars now? </strong>Well, the <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=760\" title=\"\">box tree caterpillar</a> is an invasive species. It only arrived in Europe from east Asia in the last 10 years, and the first caterpillars were reported in Britain in 2011.</p> <p><strong>It’s a Chinese invasion! </strong>Probably. Last year, the Royal Horticultural Society, which is like the AA for plants, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/18/invasive-hedge-eating-caterpillar-tops-uk-garden-pest-poll\" title=\"\">received more inquiries about these caterpillars than any other pest</a>; there were 122 inquiries about slugs and snails, which came second, compared with 433 about the box tree caterpillars.</p> <p><strong>Won’t that just reflect the fact that gardeners already know about slugs and snails and don’t need advice, whereas these caterpillars are new to them?</strong> Shush. The point is that the box tree caterpillar is a major problem, and it’s on the march.</p> <p><strong>But how can we stop them?</strong> Er … Don’t know. There are things to try, but they all have drawbacks. In east Asia, their population is regulated by predators that we don’t have here.</p> <p><strong>Let’s import some, then!</strong> I wouldn’t recommend it. The main one is the Asian predatory wasp, which has a very nasty sting and is itself an invasive species in south-west France, where it is a threat to bees.</p> <p><strong>Curse these marauding foreign hordes!</strong> Yeah, maybe. Sometimes it’s a matter of getting used to things. Remember that, in Britain, <em>we</em> are an invasive species. It was all Neanderthals round here until Homo sapiens came along and eventuallly drove them to extinction.</p> <p><strong>At least we didn’t eat their hedges. </strong>No. There is that.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “They come over here … devouring our topiary …”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “We must take back control of our herbaceous borders.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11362550","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2475817","internalRevision":"84","publication":"The

This week Moon Juice recommends that you build <a href=\"http://www.moonjuiceshop.com/blogs/news/114751875-beauty-food-intentions\">an actual shrine to their products</a>. “Create a simple altar to honour them out in the open,” it says, “to encourage sprinkling, nibbling and blending with whimsy of the spices, herbs and petals”.</p> <p><strong>Surely they also provide a good evidence-base for their claims? </strong>Not really.

Well, um, McShane is going to appear for an unspecified amount of time in season six as a character that I can’t tell you about.

For instance, in the same interview he shared this view on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\" title=\"\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>’s Academy Award: “Not the finest performance, just him grunting and being raped by a bear.

giant gas bubbles explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle?","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-14T16:57:40Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name: </strong>The Bermuda Triangle</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 52 years.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Then all of a sudden … disappearance!</p> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Between Miami, Puerto Rico and Bermuda (approx).</p> <p><strong>What is it? </strong>Well, according to Vincent Gaddis, who first coined the phrase in a <a href=\"https://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/BermudaTriangle/vincentgaddis.txt\">pulp magazine article in 1964</a>, the Bermuda Triangle is an area of the western North Atlantic where ships and planes are strangely likely to vanish without trace. It’s also a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USTEYpJzugI\">terrible song by Barry Manilow</a>.</p> <p><strong>I see. Leaving Manilow aside for now, why would things southwest of Bermuda suddenly vanish?</strong> Some suggest the involvement of aliens, the devil and the lost city of Atlantis. Some say that the magnetic properties of the rocks might scramble compass readings, others that <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Science/article1677701.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2016_03_12\">giant bubbles of methane might sink ships when they reach the surface</a>.</p> <p><strong>Hilarious! </strong>Actually, that last one might be true. Researchers at the Arctic University of Norway have just discovered huge underwater craters off the coast of Norway, which they consider “probably a cause of enormous blowouts of gas”. The craters that is, not Norway.</p> <p><strong>Goodness.</strong> And ships certainly could sink suddenly if the water beneath them turned to foam, which these craters – measuring up to 45m deep and 800m wide – could be capable of doing.</p> <p><strong>So that solves the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle? </strong>Nope.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> First, it isn’t clear whether gas blowouts happen in the triangle area. Second, even if they did, it isn’t clear how they would make planes vanish from the sky above. Third, several of the incidents attributed to “the Bermuda Triangle” involve people vanishing from ships, rather than whole ships vanishing. Fourth, there isn’t anything mysterious about the Bermuda Triangle to start with.</p> <p><strong>What? </strong>Gaddis’s original article, and others that followed it, were total cobblers. Some supposedly vanished boats were later found. Other vanishings, such as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/12031649/Whatever-happened-to-the-Bermuda-Triangle.html\">the disappearance in 1945 of the five Flight 19 training planes</a>, just aren’t difficult to explain. (They got lost and ran out of fuel.) Indeed boats and planes only vanish in the Bermuda Triangle about as often as they vanish everywhere else.</p> <p><strong>So you could say that the Bermuda Triangle itself is … a phantom mystery?</strong> Erm, yes, if you feel like it.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> Did aliens make people believe that ships were going missing in the west Atlantic?</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>Attack of the killer sea farts!</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11347509","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2473030","internalRevision":"76","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Researchers say methane rising to the surface of the ocean could explain the sudden loss of ships in the western North Atlantic.
