In fact, these pests can quickly defoliate an entire box hedge, and are now doing so all over the south of England.</p> <p><strong>Is a box hedge a hedge in the shape of a box?</strong> Often, although box (or buxus) is <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=88\" title=\"\">really the name of the type of shrub</a> that is frequently clipped into formal squares, topiary animals, mazes and so on.</p> <p><strong>Yes, my garden in the south of England has several of those. So, how come they’re only being chomped by these caterpillars now? </strong>Well, the <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=760\" title=\"\">box tree caterpillar</a> is an invasive species. It only arrived in Europe from east Asia in the last 10 years, and the first caterpillars were reported in Britain in 2011.</p> <p><strong>It’s a Chinese invasion! </strong>Probably. Last year, the Royal Horticultural Society, which is like the AA for plants, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/18/invasive-hedge-eating-caterpillar-tops-uk-garden-pest-poll\" title=\"\">received more inquiries about these caterpillars than any other pest</a>; there were 122 inquiries about slugs and snails, which came second, compared with 433 about the box tree caterpillars.</p> <p><strong>Won’t that just reflect the fact that gardeners already know about slugs and snails and don’t need advice, whereas these caterpillars are new to them?</strong> Shush. The point is that the box tree caterpillar is a major problem, and it’s on the march.</p> <p><strong>But how can we stop them?</strong> Er … Don’t know. There are things to try, but they all have drawbacks. In east Asia, their population is regulated by predators that we don’t have here.</p> <p><strong>Let’s import some, then!</strong> I wouldn’t recommend it. The main one is the Asian predatory wasp, which has a very nasty sting and is itself an invasive species in south-west France, where it is a threat to bees.</p> <p><strong>Curse these marauding foreign hordes!</strong> Yeah, maybe. Sometimes it’s a matter of getting used to things. Remember that, in Britain, <em>we</em> are an invasive species. It was all Neanderthals round here until Homo sapiens came along and eventuallly drove them to extinction.</p> <p><strong>At least we didn’t eat their hedges. </strong>No. There is that.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “They come over here … devouring our topiary …”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “We must take back control of our herbaceous borders.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11362550","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2475817","internalRevision":"84","publication":"The

What actually are “sexual flow”, “primordial energy” and “vital essence”? </strong>Oh, they’re just some deeply scientific things that the manufacturer, Gwyneth’s friend Amanda Chantal Bacon, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3439022/She-s-ten-Gwyneth-Paltrows-one-Health-obsessed-juice-bar-founder-mocked-online-detailing-pretentious-hippie-diet-reishi-maca-Shilajit-resin-Brain-Dust.html\">likes to talk about</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e70bfd292718f3426efd8bd27a439218726aa87b\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e70bfd292718f3426efd8bd27a439218726aa87b/668_45_2253_2815/800.jpg\" alt=\"Gwyneth Paltrow with some of her products.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwyneth Paltrow with some of her products.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Right. And people will spend $60 on this stuff, will they?</strong> It seems so. <a href=\"http://\">Sex Dust is currently out of stock on Goop</a>, even though a lecturer in human nutrition at Reading University describes himself as “rather sceptical” about its efficacy. “The products throw a lot of Chinese medicinal products together for which the evidence is primarily anecdotal,” <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-03/15/gwyneth-paltrow-sex-dust\">Dr Danny Commane told wired.co.uk</a>, after casting an eye over other Moon Juice products.</p> <p><strong>And Moon Juice is?</strong> It’s Bacon’s very funny company, “a cosmic beacon for those seeking out beauty, wellness and longevity” which sells “miraculous lifestyle tools” to rich people in California. This week Moon Juice recommends that you build <a href=\"http://www.moonjuiceshop.com/blogs/news/114751875-beauty-food-intentions\">an actual shrine to their products</a>. “Create a simple altar to honour them out in the open,” it says, “to encourage sprinkling, nibbling and blending with whimsy of the spices, herbs and petals”.</p> <p><strong>Surely they also provide a good evidence-base for their claims? </strong>Not really. To be fair, it’s hard to give an evidence-base for <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/style/meet-amanda-chantal-bacon-founder-and-chef-of-the-108754666126.html\">statements such as</a>: “I like to think of Moon Juice as an etheric potion that is coming from the cosmos to save the entire human race.”</p> <p><strong>Yes.</strong> The closest they get is a mention of Bacon’s own “transformative experience – backed up by extensive blood tests, the scrutiny of several physicians, renewed feelings of vitality, and a shift in my personality, immunity, appearance and thought”.</p> <p><strong>I think we’d all get renewed feelings of vitality if we could shift 2oz of dust at 40 quid a time! </strong>I think so, too.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “There’s one hypno-birthed every minute.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: “</strong>Is that why the NHS <a href=\"http://goodthinkingsociety.org/projects/nhs-homeopathy-legal-challenge/nhs-homeopathy-spending/\">still spends millions on homeopathy</a>?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11354159","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2474413","internalRevision":"81","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Sold out on Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, the $60 powder claims to have ‘primordial’ aphrodisiac powders.

Well, um, McShane is going to appear for an unspecified amount of time in season six as a character that I can’t tell you about. However, he has <a href=\"http://europe.newsweek.com/ian-mcshane-just-gave-away-another-game-thrones-spoiler-436399?rm=eu\" title=\"\">gone rogue in a number of interviews this month</a>, and basically told everything – including what happens to his character, and some big news about a much-loved character from a previous season or seasons.</p> <p><strong>That’s outrageous.</strong> <strong>Game of Thrones fans might accidentally discover what happens if they go on to the internet and try to find out.</strong> <strong>I hope Mr McShane is feeling chastened?</strong> He doesn’t do chastened. “You say the slightest thing and the internet goes ape,” <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/03/11/ian-mcshane-game-of-thrones-is-just-tits-and-dragons/\" title=\"\">he said</a> when questioned on the matter. “I was accused of giving the plot away, but I just think, get a fucking life.

For instance, in the same interview he shared this view on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/leonardodicaprio\" title=\"\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>’s Academy Award: “Not the finest performance, just him grunting and being raped by a bear. The Oscars are ridiculous.”</p> <p><strong>To be fair, the Oscars are ridiculous.</strong> Ssh!

giant gas bubbles explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle?","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-14T16:57:40Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name: </strong>The Bermuda Triangle</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 52 years.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Then all of a sudden … disappearance!</p> <p><strong>Location: </strong>Between Miami, Puerto Rico and Bermuda (approx).</p> <p><strong>What is it? </strong>Well, according to Vincent Gaddis, who first coined the phrase in a <a href=\"https://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/BermudaTriangle/vincentgaddis.txt\">pulp magazine article in 1964</a>, the Bermuda Triangle is an area of the western North Atlantic where ships and planes are strangely likely to vanish without trace. It’s also a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USTEYpJzugI\">terrible song by Barry Manilow</a>.</p> <p><strong>I see. Leaving Manilow aside for now, why would things southwest of Bermuda suddenly vanish?</strong> Some suggest the involvement of aliens, the devil and the lost city of Atlantis. Some say that the magnetic properties of the rocks might scramble compass readings, others that <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Science/article1677701.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2016_03_12\">giant bubbles of methane might sink ships when they reach the surface</a>.</p> <p><strong>Hilarious! </strong>Actually, that last one might be true. Researchers at the Arctic University of Norway have just discovered huge underwater craters off the coast of Norway, which they consider “probably a cause of enormous blowouts of gas”. The craters that is, not Norway.</p> <p><strong>Goodness.</strong> And ships certainly could sink suddenly if the water beneath them turned to foam, which these craters – measuring up to 45m deep and 800m wide – could be capable of doing.</p> <p><strong>So that solves the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle? </strong>Nope.</p> <p><strong>Why not?</strong> First, it isn’t clear whether gas blowouts happen in the triangle area. Second, even if they did, it isn’t clear how they would make planes vanish from the sky above. Third, several of the incidents attributed to “the Bermuda Triangle” involve people vanishing from ships, rather than whole ships vanishing. Fourth, there isn’t anything mysterious about the Bermuda Triangle to start with.</p> <p><strong>What? </strong>Gaddis’s original article, and others that followed it, were total cobblers. Some supposedly vanished boats were later found. Other vanishings, such as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/12031649/Whatever-happened-to-the-Bermuda-Triangle.html\">the disappearance in 1945 of the five Flight 19 training planes</a>, just aren’t difficult to explain. (They got lost and ran out of fuel.) Indeed boats and planes only vanish in the Bermuda Triangle about as often as they vanish everywhere else.</p> <p><strong>So you could say that the Bermuda Triangle itself is … a phantom mystery?</strong> Erm, yes, if you feel like it.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> Did aliens make people believe that ships were going missing in the west Atlantic?</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>Attack of the killer sea farts!</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11347509","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2473030","internalRevision":"76","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Researchers say methane rising to the surface of the ocean could explain the sudden loss of ships in the western North Atlantic.

Dodgers change their recipe – and vegans aren’t happy","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-11T15:34:40Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Jammie Dodgers.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> About 50.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Round biscuit with a bleeding heart at its centre.</p> <p><strong>That’s just jam showing through. </strong>Yes. There’s no blood in the recipe – only shortbread and raspberry-flavoured jam.</p> <p><strong>So simple, and yet so pleasing. </strong>Oh, yeah – and milk.</p> <p><strong>Milk? </strong>It’s a new thing: <a href=\"https://www.burtonsbiscuits.com/\">Burton’s Biscuit Company</a>, which makes of Jammie Dodgers, has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/35764087/jammie-dodgers-arent-vegan-any-more-and-people-are-not-happy\">recently added milk protein</a> – whey – to the venerable formulation.</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> “To improve flavour and texture,” according to a statement. The change is part of an overhaul that will also see the sugar content reduced by 22%, in a bid to improve <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/biscuit-bedlam-jammie-dodgers-set-7502382\">dwindling sales</a>.</p> <p><strong>Always trying to make things better for consumers, even when they hardly notice or care. </strong>Vegans have noticed.</p> <p><strong>What do Jammie Dodgers have to do with vegans? </strong>By virtue of what they didn’t contain, Dodgers were an inadvertently vegan product, which vegan devotees could consume with a clear conscience. The addition of whey changes everything.</p> <p><strong>So veganism just got that little bit more joyless? They should be even more pleased with themselves. </strong>They’re not pleased. A week-old <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/burton-s-biscuit-company-make-jammie-dodgers-vegan-friendly-again\">change.org petition</a> asking the company to reconsider the recipe change has already garnered about 6,000 signatures.</p> <p><strong>Six thousand signatures because of a bit of milk? It’s not as if they’ve started making them out of badgers. </strong>Along with vegans, the lactose intolerant have long sought out Jammie Dodgers as a safe, milk-free treat, widely available and much cheaper than health-food-shop alternatives.</p> <p><strong>What does Burton’s have to say about the complaints? </strong>It says that Jammie Dodgers have long been labelled with the warning “may contain milk” anyway, because they’re made on a production line with other products containing dairy. “We take allergen control very seriously and aim to ensure we give the correct information to customers.”</p> <p><strong>It sounds as if some customers’ feedback is more important than others. </strong><a href=\"https://www.vegansociety.com/\">The Vegan Society</a> <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3485390/Jammy-Dodger-lovers-angry-planned-changes-biscuit-s-recipe.html\">agrees</a>: “They are reducing the size of their market significantly,” said a spokesperson, “which doesn’t seem to make much commercial sense.”</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “It seems a pointless adjustment to make if it risks alienating consumers who, for reasons of health or conscience, are trying to reduce their dairy intake. Get out the whey!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “And while you’re at it, put all that sugar back!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11339834","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-14T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2471823","internalRevision":"64","publication":"The

2,500 years old.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Smarties dropped on graph paper – well, if they were black and white Smarties and the graph paper was made of wood.</p> <p><strong>Which they basically aren’t. </strong>I don’t care. You get the picture. It’s an ancient Chinese board game with the counters that is played by tens of millions of people, mostly in east Asia.</p> <p><strong>Is this the one that isn’t mahjong?</strong> That’s right. Mahjong is more like rummy, whereas Go is more like chess.</p> <p><strong>And Go is the one that even the most powerful computers in the world can’t master?</strong> It was until this week. Google’s DeepMind software AlphaGo has just beaten the world Go champion, Lee Se-dol of South Korea, in the first of a series of five matches.</p> <p><strong>So this is like the Go equivalent of that </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/may/12/deep-blue-beats-kasparov-1997\"><strong>Kasparov v IBM’s Deep Blue</strong></a><strong> chess match in 1997?</strong> Yes. And there is a $1m (£704,000) prize for the winner.</p> <p><strong>Yikes! Poor old Lee. How is he taking it?</strong> OK. “I was very surprised because I did not think that I would lose the game,” he said. “A mistake I made at the very beginning lasted until the very last.”</p> <p><strong>He should probably stop making mistakes then.</strong> You would make a great coach.</p> <p><strong>You bet I would. Especially if I knew the rules.</strong> Well, as I say, it is a bit like chess, just simpler and more complicated.</p> <p><strong>Eh?</strong> It’s simpler insofar as two players take turns to place pieces, known as stones, on the intersections of a grid, trying to seal off areas and surround each other’s stones, which are then removed from the board.</p> <p><strong>Sounds very simple. </strong>Yes, except that with its 19x19 grid, you end up with an unimaginably vast number of possible positions – more than the number of atoms in the universe. Hence, the challenge, even for computers.</p> <p><strong>Why do they call it “Go”? Does it mean something special in Chinese?</strong> It’s just what westerners call the game, based on the Japanese name <em>igo</em>. In Chinese, it’s known as <em>wéiqí</em>.</p> <p><strong>That’s miles cooler. We should call it that. What does it mean?</strong> Encirclement board game.</p> <p><strong>Chinese is such a romantic language. </strong>You bet it is.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“If computers are getting so clever, why does my internet keep cutting out?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Computers aren’t infinitely clever, just cleverer than you.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11332597","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-10T00:00:00Z","internalPageCode":"2470405","internalRevision":"54","publication":"The

the UK village with worse internet than Mount Everest","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-06T18:00:40Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name: </strong>Miserden, Gloucestershire.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Old enough to be mentioned in the Domesday Book – which was completed in 1086 – under its former name, Greenhampstead.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> The living embodiment of nominative determinism.</p> <p><strong>I can’t remember what nominative determinism is. Let me Google that.</strong> Hold up a second. Before you Google anything, do you live in Miserden?</p> <p><strong>I do, yes.</strong> Then don’t bother Googling anything. Walk to a library and look it up instead. It’ll be so much quicker, I promise.</p> <p><strong>But the nearest library is four miles away. It’ll take me 90 minutes to walk there.</strong> Listen to me. It’ll still be quicker.</p> <p><strong>Why’s that?</strong> Because Miserden has officially the UK’s stingiest broadband download speeds, that’s why. <a href=\"https://www.cable.co.uk/news/where-is-the-worst-broadband-in-the-uk-speed-test-results-spark-debate-700001386/\">Tests have shown</a> that the local population endures an average speed of 1.3Mbps. One especially unlucky resident there even recorded a speed of 0.12Mbps.</p> <p><strong>Is that slow?</strong> Given that the <a href=\"http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/broadband-speeds/broadband-speeds-november2014/\">average speed in the UK is 22.8Mbps</a>, it’s incredibly slow. It would take you about 11 hours to download a film. That’s literally almost twice as long as it would take on Mount Everest.</p> <p><strong>That doesn’t seem fair.</strong> It’s not. Although Miserden is the worst, there are several of these rural blackspots around the country. The risk is that everyone will eventually move out of these areas, because they won’t be able to email their family or watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzRH3iTQPrk\">that YouTube video of the sneezing panda</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oi, spoilers! I’ve been trying to download that video for the past three hours!</strong> Have you got to the bit where the panda looks as if it’s about to sneeze?</p> <p><strong>No.</strong> See what a mess this is? Most of the country takes reliable, high-speed internet for granted, and basic neglect like this risks turning some of our prettiest villages into ghost towns.</p> <p><strong>It’s OK. We persevere. </strong>Wait a minute, are you reading this online?</p> <p><strong>I am, yes.</strong> When are you reading this?</p> <p><strong>Well, I started loading the page the second it was published, so it’s now October 2018.</strong> Oh, wow, you’re from the future. Say hello to President Trump for me!</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Access to the internet is a fundamental human right.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “How am I going to get all my cat gifs now? Go outside and look at a cat? Yuck.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11318001","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-07T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2467902","internalRevision":"50","publication":"The

Michael Fallon’s dead cat strategy work on Sadiq Khan?","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-02T15:38:00Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Michael Fallon.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 63.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Silvery City gent.</p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Defence secretary.</p> <p><strong>Cool. So can he do kung fu and stuff?</strong> I don’t believe so. Being defence secretary is more about equipping the armed forces to be good at war. Although Fallon is kind of the Tories’ hitman, with a special move of his own.</p> <p><strong>And that is?</strong> The dead cat manoeuvre.</p> <p><strong>Scary. What is it?</strong> It’s a political tactic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/20/lynton-crosby-and-dead-cat-won-election-conservatives-labour-intellectually-lazy\">often associated with the election strategist Lynton Crosby</a>.</p> <p><strong>Surely killing cats is unlikely to win votes?</strong> No actual cats are harmed during the manoeuvre. It gets its name from the idea that if you walk into a dinner party and fling a dead cat on the table, people probably won’t be pleased, but they’ll stop whatever they were talking about and talk about the cat instead.</p> <p><strong>And that’s good, is it? </strong>Certainly, if things weren’t going your way before. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/03/undoing-of-ed-miliband-and-how-labour-lost-election\">Fallon is credited with a lethal dead cat move during last year’s election campaign</a>, when he accused Ed Miliband of preparing to ditch Trident in a deal with the SNP. Until that moment, Labour had been gaining popularity, at least according to <em>those</em> polls. Afterwards, they weren’t.</p> <p><strong>I see.</strong> And now he’s done it again at a party meeting in Bromley. Labour’s Sadiq Khan is favourite to be elected mayor of London, but <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/12179596/Sadiq-Khan-is-unfit-to-be-London-Mayor-Tory-cabinet-minister-says-in-heated-attack.html\">Fallon has called him</a> a “Labour lackey who speaks alongside extremists” and “a man who has said Britain’s foreign policy is to blame for the terrorist threat”.</p> <p><strong>Is that fair?</strong> Possibly not. The speaks-alongside-extremists thing seems like either a reference to the unsavoury people, such as Louis Farrakhan, whom <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-i-represented-unsavoury-individuals-when-i-was-a-human-rights-lawyer-a3183266.html\">Khan sometimes represented as a human-rights lawyer</a>, or to his former brother-in-law, who once had links to <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/defence-secretary-blasts-sadiq-khan-as-labour-lackey-who-shares-platforms-with-extremists-a3192571.html\">the extremist group Al-Muhajiroun</a>. Khan himself has often<a href=\"http://www.sadiqkhan.org.uk/let_s_not_let_the_killers_speak_for_islam\"> condemned extremism</a>. He <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11878/sadiq_khan/tooting/divisions?policy=826\">voted for gay marriage</a>.</p> <p><strong>How about the blaming-Britain thing?</strong> That’s probably about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/12/politics.terrorism\">an open letter Khan signed in 2006</a>, calling for a change to foreign policy, which, the letter claimed, was “ammunition to extremists who threaten us all”. It never blamed Britain for terrorism, though. It just said that British policy was helping the terrorists’ propaganda.</p> <p><strong>And look at us now! Can’t you see what’s happened?</strong> What?</p> <p><strong>We’re talking about the dead cat!</strong> Curses!</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “He’s more of an attack secretary.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I reckon even dead cats stop being interesting after the first few.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11310669","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-03-03T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2466615","internalRevision":"54","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The defence secretary famously sank Ed Miliband’s election chances with a swipe about the SNP.
