Satiating Saturday? – and the biggest gold rush of the Games so far, with a full 30 on offer today. Follow them all here, if only to test the live blog team as we try not to miss any. Here’s our recap of day 14, when half of Britain remembered how exciting hockey can be (the other half knew already) and the greatest athlete continued to be the greatest athlete. The big picture It’s nine golds for Usain Bolt as he motored Jamaica home in the men’s 4x100m in laughably brilliant style. That’s the triple treble – 100m, 200m and 4x100m in three successive Games – and, he says, the end of his Olympic career. A special note for pedantic readers (you’re my favourites) – you’ll see a lot of “triple triple”s flying about, but I’m sticking with “triple treble” and the man himself confirms it:\nJapan’s men zoomed into a surprising second place in that men’s 4x100m, but the relays were dotted with disqualifications. The US men completed their celebratory lap before learning the bronze was not theirs: the Mike Rodgers-Justin Gatlin baton swap was outside the zone, and Canada found themselves with an extra medal. Team GB topped their 4x400m men’s relay heat but won’t be in today’s final after they too exchanged the baton in the wrong place and were disqualified. Trinidad and Tobago’s men managed their own unique double, disqualified from both the 4x100m final and the 4x400m heats. Disqualification isn’t the end, though (I mean, technically it is, most of the time). The US women’s 4x100m team, out of the final then in again, ended up with the gold medal ahead of Jamaica and Team GB. You should also know: Germany beat Sweden 2-1 to win their first women’s football gold. Brazil to play for pride not revenge in men’s football final. Rio Paralympics to be downsized amid disappointing ticket sales. Gunnar Bentz: Ryan Lochte shouted at guards during gas station incident. Picture of the day\nTeam GB roundup A final, a penalty shoot-out: the omens weren’t good but the result was. Team GB’s women emerged golden and glorious over the Netherlands in the hockey final, winning the shootout 2-0 after the match ended 3-3. Unbeaten in Rio, the team made history in all sorts of ways: the first women’s hockey gold for Britain, and the first same-sex married couple (captain Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh) to win Olympic gold. History too for Nick Skelton, at 58 the second oldest British gold-winner (but you have to go a long way back – 1908 – for the oldest), as he leapt remarkably to the top of the podium for individual showjumping. In seven Games he’s now collected two golds – and a broken neck and a hip replacement along the way – and he says he’ll keep going as long as his horse, Big Star, keeps jumping.\nAin’t that a kick in the head: Lutalo Muhammad was leading in the men’s -80kg taekwondo until – literally; abandon suspicions of hype – the final second. The foot of Ivory Coast’s Cheick Sallah Cissé made contact with Muhammad’s helmet and that was that: Ivory Coast’s first gold, and silver for Britain. It was one up on Muhammad’s 2012 bronze but he was heartbroken, weeping in his post-bout interview as he apologised (no need!) to spectators who’d stayed up late to watch him. Insomniacs would also have caught a bronze in the women’s 4x100m: Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryl Neita ran it in 41.77s and nabbed Britain’s first women’s sprint relay medal for 36 years. The sleepless will be rewarded tonight as Mo Farah runs in the 5,000m at 1.30am BST, with Team GB’s women (if not the disqualified men) taking up the baton for the 4x400m after that. Those with less stamina can still catch Tom Daley and Nicola Adams earlier in the day (see diary below). Team GB to return to victory parades in Manchester and London. Joe Joyce reaches super-heavyweight boxing final. Hockey: Twitter reacts to ‘one of the best moments of the Games’. Australia team roundup Chloe Esposito describes herself as “chronically indecisive so I do modern pentathlon”. Luckily, she does it decisively well. Esposito took gold in the women’s quintet of fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting and cross-country running – Australia’s first ever Olympic medal in the discipline – recovering from seventh place before the final round to emerge as champion. Her brother Max Esposito will be gunning for a second in the men’s event today, if only because it’s really annoying when your siblings beat you.\nJust weeks after he was finally presented with the gold medal he should have worn at London 2012 (the belated disqualification of Russian drug cheat Sergey Kirdyapkin bumping him up from second place), Jared Tallent won a silver in Rio in the 50km walk. He was briskly ahead with five minutes to go but, as Tallent put it, “ just ran out of legs” and lost out to Slovakia’s Matej Toth, who had retained his legs to the last. One gold, two silvers and a bronze make Tallent Australia’s most decorated Olympic athletics competitor. In the women’s pole vault, Alana Boyd only just – having hit the same heights but with one more miss than third-placed Eliza McCartney of New Zealand – failed to win a medal. It was boo-hoo time for the Boomers, who crashed out 87-61 in the semi-finals of the men’s basketball. Their vanquishers? Serbia, whose women’s team knocked Australia out at the quarter-final stage. Serbia (men’s) now face the mighty Team USA on the final day of the Games; the Boomers scrabble for bronze against Spain at 11.30am on Rio’s Sunday morning (that’s 12.30am Monday AEST for the really committed). And no BMX medals will be coming home after high hopes Caroline Buchanan (who crashed out in the women’s semi-final) and Sam Willoughby (sixth in the men’s final) went up and over and out. Australian athletes questioned by police in Rio over basketball accreditation. Emma McKeon will march in closing ceremony after apology for Rio night out. Team Australia day 14 roundup. Team USA roundup Three golds counts as a lull when you’re top of the leaderboard, although there was a highlight in the commanding victory for the US women in the 4x100m relay final they nearly didn’t make. An impressive (understatement) team of Tianna Bartoletta, Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Tori Bowie – three of them already with Rio medals stashed in the locker – saw off Jamaica and Britain in 41.01s. Felix, now the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals, incredibly gets another go at besting that in the 4x400m finals today. The US women qualified fastest, do I need to add?\nIt looked as if the women’s gold would be paired with a bronze by the men’s sprint team before they were turfed out of their 4x100m finals for a baton-swap mishap. Bartoletta, Felix, Gardner and Bowie will instead have to compare golds with the women’s water polo team, who fended off Italy 12-5 in their final. Connor Fields swiped gold on his way to men’s BMX victory, too. Alise Post took silver in the women’s BMX, as did Sandi Morris in the women’s pole vault. Men’s basketball semi-final: USA beat Spain 82-76. Diary All times below are local to Rio: here’s the full day 15 timetable tweaked for wherever you are. Or add four hours for UK, add 13 hours for eastern Australia; subtract one hour for east-coast US and four for west coast. Seven golds to watch for in athletics: the women’s high jump at 8.30pm; men’s javelin at 8.55pm; men’s 1,500m at 9pm; women’s 800m at 9.15pm (is Caster Semenya unbeatable here?); men’s 5,000m at 9.30pm (COME. ON. MO.); the women’s 4x400m relay at 10pm; and the men’s 4x400m relay at 10.35pm. Britain’s Nicola Adams will be after the double in her women’s flyweight gold bout against France’s Sarah Ourahmoune at 2pm. Two other boxing finals: the men’s bantamweight at 2.15pm and men’s middleweight at 3pm.\nThe men’s 10m platform diving semi-finals jump off at 11am, with the final at 4.30pm. Britain’s Tom Daley qualified first. Team USA take on Spain in the women’s basketball final at 3.30pm. And it’s the final, too, of the women’s handball: that one, also at 3.30pm, is France v Russia. Men’s football sees Brazil v Germany in the final at 5.30pm. Honduras and Nigeria scrap for bronze at 1pm. It’s China v Serbia in the women’s volleyball final at 10.15pm. Netherlands and the US play for bronze at 1pm. The men’s water polo washes up with a Croatia v Serbia final at 5.50pm. The badminton concludes with the men’s singles gold match; China or Malaysia will win that one. They’re sprinting through the canoeing finals with four today: the men’s kayak single 200m at 9.07am (featuring GB’s silver medallist Liam Heath); men’s canoe double 1,000m at 9.22am; women’s kayak four 500m at 9.47am; and the men’s kayak four 1,000m at 10.12am. The women’s triathlon gets going at 11am. It’s the first outing for cycling of the mountain bike variety, with the women’s cross-country at 12.30pm. The final round of the women’s golf – shall I? Yes – tees off at 7am. South Korea’s Inbee Park leads NZ’s Lydia Ko in the standings. It’s the final of the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around at precisely 4.59pm. Five heats of the men’s modern pentathlon conclude at 6pm. Australia’s Max Esposito is under pressure after his sister Chloe took gold in the women’s. Two taekwondo finals: the women’s +67kg at 10pm – Britain’s Bianca Walkden is world champion and would like to be there – and the men’s +80kg at 10.15pm. The penultimate day of wrestling closes with two finals in the men’s freestyle 86kg and 125kg. Sportspersonship of the day There was drama in the men’s 50km walk as Japanese athlete and third-placed finisher Hirooki Arai was disqualified and then reinstated. Which meant Canada’s Evan Dunfree was – all too briefly – a bronze medal-winner. He explained why he decided not to appeal against the decision: Even if an appeal to CAS [court of arbitration for sport] were successful I would not have been able to receive that medal with a clear conscience and it isn’t something I would have been proud of. I will sleep soundly tonight, and for the rest of my life, knowing I made the right decision. I will never allow myself to be defined by the accolades I receive, rather the integrity I carry through life. Tweet of the day When Team USA had a second shot at qualifying for the finals of the women’s 4x100m – and blitzed it – it was China that was shunted off the start list. Still, they’re taking news that they were bumped for the eventual winners in good spirit. Ish.\nIf today were a swing classic It would have to be Dean Martin’s Ain’t That a Kick in the Head.

Satiating Saturday? – and the biggest gold rush of the Games so far, with a full 30 on offer today. Follow them all here, if only to test the live blog team as we try not to miss any. Here’s our recap of day 14, when half of Britain remembered how exciting hockey can be (the other half knew already) and the greatest athlete continued to be the greatest athlete. The big picture It’s nine golds for Usain Bolt as he motored Jamaica home in the men’s 4x100m in laughably brilliant style. That’s the triple treble – 100m, 200m and 4x100m in three successive Games – and, he says, the end of his Olympic career. A special note for pedantic readers (you’re my favourites) – you’ll see a lot of “triple triple”s flying about, but I’m sticking with “triple treble” and the man himself confirms it:\nJapan’s men zoomed into a surprising second place in that men’s 4x100m, but the relays were dotted with disqualifications. The US men completed their celebratory lap before learning the bronze was not theirs: the Mike Rodgers-Justin Gatlin baton swap was outside the zone, and Canada found themselves with an extra medal. Team GB topped their 4x400m men’s relay heat but won’t be in today’s final after they too exchanged the baton in the wrong place and were disqualified. Trinidad and Tobago’s men managed their own unique double, disqualified from both the 4x100m final and the 4x400m heats. Disqualification isn’t the end, though (I mean, technically it is, most of the time). The US women’s 4x100m team, out of the final then in again, ended up with the gold medal ahead of Jamaica and Team GB. You should also know: Germany beat Sweden 2-1 to win their first women’s football gold. Brazil to play for pride not revenge in men’s football final. Rio Paralympics to be downsized amid disappointing ticket sales. Gunnar Bentz: Ryan Lochte shouted at guards during gas station incident. Picture of the day\nTeam GB roundup A final, a penalty shoot-out: the omens weren’t good but the result was. Team GB’s women emerged golden and glorious over the Netherlands in the hockey final, winning the shootout 2-0 after the match ended 3-3. Unbeaten in Rio, the team made history in all sorts of ways: the first women’s hockey gold for Britain, and the first same-sex married couple (captain Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh) to win Olympic gold. History too for Nick Skelton, at 58 the second oldest British gold-winner (but you have to go a long way back – 1908 – for the oldest), as he leapt remarkably to the top of the podium for individual showjumping. In seven Games he’s now collected two golds – and a broken neck and a hip replacement along the way – and he says he’ll keep going as long as his horse, Big Star, keeps jumping.\nAin’t that a kick in the head: Lutalo Muhammad was leading in the men’s -80kg taekwondo until – literally; abandon suspicions of hype – the final second. The foot of Ivory Coast’s Cheick Sallah Cissé made contact with Muhammad’s helmet and that was that: Ivory Coast’s first gold, and silver for Britain. It was one up on Muhammad’s 2012 bronze but he was heartbroken, weeping in his post-bout interview as he apologised (no need!) to spectators who’d stayed up late to watch him. Insomniacs would also have caught a bronze in the women’s 4x100m: Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryl Neita ran it in 41.77s and nabbed Britain’s first women’s sprint relay medal for 36 years. The sleepless will be rewarded tonight as Mo Farah runs in the 5,000m at 1.30am BST, with Team GB’s women (if not the disqualified men) taking up the baton for the 4x400m after that. Those with less stamina can still catch Tom Daley and Nicola Adams earlier in the day (see diary below). Team GB to return to victory parades in Manchester and London. Joe Joyce reaches super-heavyweight boxing final. Hockey: Twitter reacts to ‘one of the best moments of the Games’. Australia team roundup Chloe Esposito describes herself as “chronically indecisive so I do modern pentathlon”. Luckily, she does it decisively well. Esposito took gold in the women’s quintet of fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting and cross-country running – Australia’s first ever Olympic medal in the discipline – recovering from seventh place before the final round to emerge as champion. Her brother Max Esposito will be gunning for a second in the men’s event today, if only because it’s really annoying when your siblings beat you.\nJust weeks after he was finally presented with the gold medal he should have worn at London 2012 (the belated disqualification of Russian drug cheat Sergey Kirdyapkin bumping him up from second place), Jared Tallent won a silver in Rio in the 50km walk. He was briskly ahead with five minutes to go but, as Tallent put it, “ just ran out of legs” and lost out to Slovakia’s Matej Toth, who had retained his legs to the last. One gold, two silvers and a bronze make Tallent Australia’s most decorated Olympic athletics competitor. In the women’s pole vault, Alana Boyd only just – having hit the same heights but with one more miss than third-placed Eliza McCartney of New Zealand – failed to win a medal. It was boo-hoo time for the Boomers, who crashed out 87-61 in the semi-finals of the men’s basketball. Their vanquishers? Serbia, whose women’s team knocked Australia out at the quarter-final stage. Serbia (men’s) now face the mighty Team USA on the final day of the Games; the Boomers scrabble for bronze against Spain at 11.30am on Rio’s Sunday morning (that’s 12.30am Monday AEST for the really committed). And no BMX medals will be coming home after high hopes Caroline Buchanan (who crashed out in the women’s semi-final) and Sam Willoughby (sixth in the men’s final) went up and over and out. Australian athletes questioned by police in Rio over basketball accreditation. Emma McKeon will march in closing ceremony after apology for Rio night out. Team Australia day 14 roundup. Team USA roundup Three golds counts as a lull when you’re top of the leaderboard, although there was a highlight in the commanding victory for the US women in the 4x100m relay final they nearly didn’t make. An impressive (understatement) team of Tianna Bartoletta, Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Tori Bowie – three of them already with Rio medals stashed in the locker – saw off Jamaica and Britain in 41.01s. Felix, now the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals, incredibly gets another go at besting that in the 4x400m finals today. The US women qualified fastest, do I need to add?\nIt looked as if the women’s gold would be paired with a bronze by the men’s sprint team before they were turfed out of their 4x100m finals for a baton-swap mishap. Bartoletta, Felix, Gardner and Bowie will instead have to compare golds with the women’s water polo team, who fended off Italy 12-5 in their final. Connor Fields swiped gold on his way to men’s BMX victory, too. Alise Post took silver in the women’s BMX, as did Sandi Morris in the women’s pole vault. Men’s basketball semi-final: USA beat Spain 82-76. Diary All times below are local to Rio: here’s the full day 15 timetable tweaked for wherever you are. Or add four hours for UK, add 13 hours for eastern Australia; subtract one hour for east-coast US and four for west coast. Seven golds to watch for in athletics: the women’s high jump at 8.30pm; men’s javelin at 8.55pm; men’s 1,500m at 9pm; women’s 800m at 9.15pm (is Caster Semenya unbeatable here?); men’s 5,000m at 9.30pm (COME. ON. MO.); the women’s 4x400m relay at 10pm; and the men’s 4x400m relay at 10.35pm. Britain’s Nicola Adams will be after the double in her women’s flyweight gold bout against France’s Sarah Ourahmoune at 2pm. Two other boxing finals: the men’s bantamweight at 2.15pm and men’s middleweight at 3pm.\nThe men’s 10m platform diving semi-finals jump off at 11am, with the final at 4.30pm. Britain’s Tom Daley qualified first. Team USA take on Spain in the women’s basketball final at 3.30pm. And it’s the final, too, of the women’s handball: that one, also at 3.30pm, is France v Russia. Men’s football sees Brazil v Germany in the final at 5.30pm. Honduras and Nigeria scrap for bronze at 1pm. It’s China v Serbia in the women’s volleyball final at 10.15pm. Netherlands and the US play for bronze at 1pm. The men’s water polo washes up with a Croatia v Serbia final at 5.50pm. The badminton concludes with the men’s singles gold match; China or Malaysia will win that one. They’re sprinting through the canoeing finals with four today: the men’s kayak single 200m at 9.07am (featuring GB’s silver medallist Liam Heath); men’s canoe double 1,000m at 9.22am; women’s kayak four 500m at 9.47am; and the men’s kayak four 1,000m at 10.12am. The women’s triathlon gets going at 11am. It’s the first outing for cycling of the mountain bike variety, with the women’s cross-country at 12.30pm. The final round of the women’s golf – shall I? Yes – tees off at 7am. South Korea’s Inbee Park leads NZ’s Lydia Ko in the standings. It’s the final of the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around at precisely 4.59pm. Five heats of the men’s modern pentathlon conclude at 6pm. Australia’s Max Esposito is under pressure after his sister Chloe took gold in the women’s. Two taekwondo finals: the women’s +67kg at 10pm – Britain’s Bianca Walkden is world champion and would like to be there – and the men’s +80kg at 10.15pm. The penultimate day of wrestling closes with two finals in the men’s freestyle 86kg and 125kg. Sportspersonship of the day There was drama in the men’s 50km walk as Japanese athlete and third-placed finisher Hirooki Arai was disqualified and then reinstated. Which meant Canada’s Evan Dunfree was – all too briefly – a bronze medal-winner. He explained why he decided not to appeal against the decision: Even if an appeal to CAS [court of arbitration for sport] were successful I would not have been able to receive that medal with a clear conscience and it isn’t something I would have been proud of. I will sleep soundly tonight, and for the rest of my life, knowing I made the right decision. I will never allow myself to be defined by the accolades I receive, rather the integrity I carry through life. Tweet of the day When Team USA had a second shot at qualifying for the finals of the women’s 4x100m – and blitzed it – it was China that was shunted off the start list. Still, they’re taking news that they were bumped for the eventual winners in good spirit. Ish.\nIf today were a swing classic It would have to be Dean Martin’s Ain’t That a Kick in the Head.

The remote Olympic Stadium, away from the main Olympic Park, has been a factor, but Coe said it was important not to leave white elephants (which followers of London’s Olympic Stadium saga might find a mite ironic). He also insisted it had been a good week for his beleaguered sport despite the doping controversies and patchy crowds: “We’ve learned our sport is alive and incredibly strong with a great appetite for public consumption.”</p> <p>He also promised to take action on suspicious qualifying times, amid concerns that some countries were gaming the system, and look again at “transfer of allegiance” after revealing that there were recently 24 transfers to new countries in a single day.</p> <p>Finally, he said he wanted to offer Usain Bolt a job when he retires. I’m sure he won’t be the only one.</p> <p>“With all the things he will go on to do, I am very keen for him to carve out some space to help us develop the sport, and not only in an ambassadorial role. He has a broader role he can play. When the time does come, we really want him to stay in the sport,” Coe said. <br /></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b8e947e4b0377cf11189b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T23:35:54.830Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Barney Ronay was at the Maracana for that dramatic shootout</strong>.

Among the crowds at the entrance here there’s’s a group of very friendly middle aged women offering “Abrazo gratis” or free hugs. After I’d had my ten minutes they asked me “Do you believe in Jesus son?” I thought about it, then said “Yes, I do, he’s grown into this tournament and looks to have a finish in both feet”. They wept openly. </p> <p>With apologies to every other sport, this watered down clash of the giants is going to be the biggest event of these Games for Brazil. Bars in every street in every city will be packed out tonight as Brazil play out their frankly baffling obsession with Olympic football. It will be down to Neymar, Gabriel Jesus and the excellent Gabigol to see Brazil through this trauma, with defeat grisly prospect for the home fans. Serge Gnabry, Max Meyer and Lars Bender are likely to play for Germany. On a separate note I once again successfully smuggled a bottle of water past the stadium guards by including a “dummy” empty bottle in my bag which i can then ruefully surrender post x-ray machine. That’s how you’re going to beat them Butch. They keep on underestimating you. <br /></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b8b4e1e4b0377cf1118924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T19:52:40.153Z\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A brilliant strike from Russia takes their lead out to 19-15 but France again pull one back.

Three experts on the BBC couldn’t come up with an answer and UK Athletics seem content to limit themselves to a tweet about the failed appeal. It sounds a lot like the athletics establishment might even be a little embarrassed - I mean, why else would no-one make a clear statement? I thought there have been successful appeals regarding out of lane infringements where no advantage was gained. What did GB do that broke the rules to their advantage (or someone else’s disadvantage)? I recommend the lottery that is the Modern Pentathlon Show Jumping this afternoon (10pm finish).

I haven’t seen it, but I can’t see how any of us went outside those zones.”</p> <p>Their disqualification meant Brazil advance to the final instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BritAthletics/status/766849431211798528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately our appeal against the Men&#39;s 4x400m DQ has not been successful. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rio2016?src=hash\">#Rio2016</a></p>&mdash; British Athletics (@BritAthletics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritAthletics/status/766849431211798528\">August 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T08:38:08.065Z\">at 9.38am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b80a5be4b047b85f601e0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T07:47:16.552Z\">8.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Post-event Olympic high-jinx among Olympians have gained a certain notoriety in recent days – Ryan Lochte and pals, those Australian athletes getting into bother with the police – but Max Whitlock hasn’t been off duty (don’t try this yourselves, kids):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Whitlock\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Needed to get a picture like this up the top of Sugarloaf mountain &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rio2016?src=hash&quot;&gt;#rio2016&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Olympics&quot;&gt;@Olympics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VrBXUITOBw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/VrBXUITOBw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Max Whitlock (@maxwhitlock1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maxwhitlock1/status/766748287609233409&quot;&gt;August 19, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b805e6e4b0b7e649001600\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T07:30:15.012Z\">8.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some stuff to peruse, while we wait:</p> <p>A natty interactive of how Jamaica brought home the gold in the 4x100:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/20/how-usain-bolt-secured-the-triple-treble-with-jamaica-in-the-4x100m\">How Usain Bolt secured the triple treble with Jamaica in the 4x100m relay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>GB hockey’s Kate Richardson-Walsh on bowing out at the top after that emotional shoot-out victory over the Netherlands:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/olympic-medal-wife-hockey-team-gb-gold\">‘To win an Olympic medal with your wife standing next to you is so special’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And a nice little vignette from Clive James on the compelling joy of the Olympics and Rio in general:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/20/clive-james-watched-everything-rio-gymnasts\">Clive James: ‘I watched everything at Rio, far into the night, cycle races and gymnastics’</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b80222e4b0377cf1118645\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T07:24:37.543Z\">8.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Morning everyone</strong>, from the other side of the world (That London).

The US men completed their celebratory lap before learning the bronze was not theirs: the <strong>Mike Rodgers</strong>-<strong>Justin Gatlin </strong>baton swap was outside the zone, and Canada found themselves with an extra medal.</p> <p>Team GB topped their 4x400m men’s relay heat but won’t be in today’s final after they too exchanged the baton in the wrong place and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/19/rio-2016-olympics-day-14-usain-bolt-relays-team-gb-hockey-women-football-live?page=with:block-57b7a789e4b047b85f601ce3#block-57b7a789e4b047b85f601ce3\">were disqualified</a>.

Satiating Saturday? – and the biggest gold rush of the Games so far, with a full 30 on offer today. Follow them all here, if only to test the live blog team as we try not to miss any. Here’s our recap of day 14, when half of Britain remembered how exciting hockey can be (the other half knew already) and the greatest athlete continued to be the greatest athlete. The big picture It’s nine golds for Usain Bolt as he motored Jamaica home in the men’s 4x100m in laughably brilliant style. That’s the triple treble – 100m, 200m and 4x100m in three successive Games – and, he says, the end of his Olympic career. A special note for pedantic readers (you’re my favourites) – you’ll see a lot of “triple triple”s flying about, but I’m sticking with “triple treble” and the man himself confirms it:\nJapan’s men zoomed into a surprising second place in that men’s 4x100m, but the relays were dotted with disqualifications. The US men completed their celebratory lap before learning the bronze was not theirs: the Mike Rodgers-Justin Gatlin baton swap was outside the zone, and Canada found themselves with an extra medal. Team GB topped their 4x400m men’s relay heat but won’t be in today’s final after they too exchanged the baton in the wrong place and were disqualified. Trinidad and Tobago’s men managed their own unique double, disqualified from both the 4x100m final and the 4x400m heats. Disqualification isn’t the end, though (I mean, technically it is, most of the time). The US women’s 4x100m team, out of the final then in again, ended up with the gold medal ahead of Jamaica and Team GB. You should also know: Germany beat Sweden 2-1 to win their first women’s football gold. Brazil to play for pride not revenge in men’s football final. Rio Paralympics to be downsized amid disappointing ticket sales. Gunnar Bentz: Ryan Lochte shouted at guards during gas station incident. Picture of the day\nTeam GB roundup A final, a penalty shoot-out: the omens weren’t good but the result was. Team GB’s women emerged golden and glorious over the Netherlands in the hockey final, winning the shootout 2-0 after the match ended 3-3. Unbeaten in Rio, the team made history in all sorts of ways: the first women’s hockey gold for Britain, and the first same-sex married couple (captain Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh) to win Olympic gold. History too for Nick Skelton, at 58 the second oldest British gold-winner (but you have to go a long way back – 1908 – for the oldest), as he leapt remarkably to the top of the podium for individual showjumping. In seven Games he’s now collected two golds – and a broken neck and a hip replacement along the way – and he says he’ll keep going as long as his horse, Big Star, keeps jumping.\nAin’t that a kick in the head: Lutalo Muhammad was leading in the men’s -80kg taekwondo until – literally; abandon suspicions of hype – the final second. The foot of Ivory Coast’s Cheick Sallah Cissé made contact with Muhammad’s helmet and that was that: Ivory Coast’s first gold, and silver for Britain. It was one up on Muhammad’s 2012 bronze but he was heartbroken, weeping in his post-bout interview as he apologised (no need!) to spectators who’d stayed up late to watch him. Insomniacs would also have caught a bronze in the women’s 4x100m: Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryl Neita ran it in 41.77s and nabbed Britain’s first women’s sprint relay medal for 36 years. The sleepless will be rewarded tonight as Mo Farah runs in the 5,000m at 1.30am BST, with Team GB’s women (if not the disqualified men) taking up the baton for the 4x400m after that. Those with less stamina can still catch Tom Daley and Nicola Adams earlier in the day (see diary below). Team GB to return to victory parades in Manchester and London. Joe Joyce reaches super-heavyweight boxing final. Hockey: Twitter reacts to ‘one of the best moments of the Games’. Australia team roundup Chloe Esposito describes herself as “chronically indecisive so I do modern pentathlon”. Luckily, she does it decisively well. Esposito took gold in the women’s quintet of fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting and cross-country running – Australia’s first ever Olympic medal in the discipline – recovering from seventh place before the final round to emerge as champion. Her brother Max Esposito will be gunning for a second in the men’s event today, if only because it’s really annoying when your siblings beat you.\nJust weeks after he was finally presented with the gold medal he should have worn at London 2012 (the belated disqualification of Russian drug cheat Sergey Kirdyapkin bumping him up from second place), Jared Tallent won a silver in Rio in the 50km walk. He was briskly ahead with five minutes to go but, as Tallent put it, “ just ran out of legs” and lost out to Slovakia’s Matej Toth, who had retained his legs to the last. One gold, two silvers and a bronze make Tallent Australia’s most decorated Olympic athletics competitor. In the women’s pole vault, Alana Boyd only just – having hit the same heights but with one more miss than third-placed Eliza McCartney of New Zealand – failed to win a medal. It was boo-hoo time for the Boomers, who crashed out 87-61 in the semi-finals of the men’s basketball. Their vanquishers? Serbia, whose women’s team knocked Australia out at the quarter-final stage. Serbia (men’s) now face the mighty Team USA on the final day of the Games; the Boomers scrabble for bronze against Spain at 11.30am on Rio’s Sunday morning (that’s 12.30am Monday AEST for the really committed). And no BMX medals will be coming home after high hopes Caroline Buchanan (who crashed out in the women’s semi-final) and Sam Willoughby (sixth in the men’s final) went up and over and out. Australian athletes questioned by police in Rio over basketball accreditation. Emma McKeon will march in closing ceremony after apology for Rio night out. Team Australia day 14 roundup. Team USA roundup Three golds counts as a lull when you’re top of the leaderboard, although there was a highlight in the commanding victory for the US women in the 4x100m relay final they nearly didn’t make. An impressive (understatement) team of Tianna Bartoletta, Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Tori Bowie – three of them already with Rio medals stashed in the locker – saw off Jamaica and Britain in 41.01s. Felix, now the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals, incredibly gets another go at besting that in the 4x400m finals today. The US women qualified fastest, do I need to add?\nIt looked as if the women’s gold would be paired with a bronze by the men’s sprint team before they were turfed out of their 4x100m finals for a baton-swap mishap. Bartoletta, Felix, Gardner and Bowie will instead have to compare golds with the women’s water polo team, who fended off Italy 12-5 in their final. Connor Fields swiped gold on his way to men’s BMX victory, too. Alise Post took silver in the women’s BMX, as did Sandi Morris in the women’s pole vault. Men’s basketball semi-final: USA beat Spain 82-76. Diary All times below are local to Rio: here’s the full day 15 timetable tweaked for wherever you are. Or add four hours for UK, add 13 hours for eastern Australia; subtract one hour for east-coast US and four for west coast. Seven golds to watch for in athletics: the women’s high jump at 8.30pm; men’s javelin at 8.55pm; men’s 1,500m at 9pm; women’s 800m at 9.15pm (is Caster Semenya unbeatable here?); men’s 5,000m at 9.30pm (COME. ON. MO.); the women’s 4x400m relay at 10pm; and the men’s 4x400m relay at 10.35pm. Britain’s Nicola Adams will be after the double in her women’s flyweight gold bout against France’s Sarah Ourahmoune at 2pm. Two other boxing finals: the men’s bantamweight at 2.15pm and men’s middleweight at 3pm.\nThe men’s 10m platform diving semi-finals jump off at 11am, with the final at 4.30pm. Britain’s Tom Daley qualified first. Team USA take on Spain in the women’s basketball final at 3.30pm. And it’s the final, too, of the women’s handball: that one, also at 3.30pm, is France v Russia. Men’s football sees Brazil v Germany in the final at 5.30pm. Honduras and Nigeria scrap for bronze at 1pm. It’s China v Serbia in the women’s volleyball final at 10.15pm. Netherlands and the US play for bronze at 1pm. The men’s water polo washes up with a Croatia v Serbia final at 5.50pm. The badminton concludes with the men’s singles gold match; China or Malaysia will win that one. They’re sprinting through the canoeing finals with four today: the men’s kayak single 200m at 9.07am (featuring GB’s silver medallist Liam Heath); men’s canoe double 1,000m at 9.22am; women’s kayak four 500m at 9.47am; and the men’s kayak four 1,000m at 10.12am. The women’s triathlon gets going at 11am. It’s the first outing for cycling of the mountain bike variety, with the women’s cross-country at 12.30pm. The final round of the women’s golf – shall I? Yes – tees off at 7am. South Korea’s Inbee Park leads NZ’s Lydia Ko in the standings. It’s the final of the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around at precisely 4.59pm. Five heats of the men’s modern pentathlon conclude at 6pm. Australia’s Max Esposito is under pressure after his sister Chloe took gold in the women’s. Two taekwondo finals: the women’s +67kg at 10pm – Britain’s Bianca Walkden is world champion and would like to be there – and the men’s +80kg at 10.15pm. The penultimate day of wrestling closes with two finals in the men’s freestyle 86kg and 125kg. Sportspersonship of the day There was drama in the men’s 50km walk as Japanese athlete and third-placed finisher Hirooki Arai was disqualified and then reinstated. Which meant Canada’s Evan Dunfree was – all too briefly – a bronze medal-winner. He explained why he decided not to appeal against the decision: Even if an appeal to CAS [court of arbitration for sport] were successful I would not have been able to receive that medal with a clear conscience and it isn’t something I would have been proud of. I will sleep soundly tonight, and for the rest of my life, knowing I made the right decision. I will never allow myself to be defined by the accolades I receive, rather the integrity I carry through life. Tweet of the day When Team USA had a second shot at qualifying for the finals of the women’s 4x100m – and blitzed it – it was China that was shunted off the start list. Still, they’re taking news that they were bumped for the eventual winners in good spirit. Ish.\nIf today were a swing classic It would have to be Dean Martin’s Ain’t That a Kick in the Head.

Satiating Saturday? – and the biggest gold rush of the Games so far, with a full 30 on offer today. Follow them all here, if only to test the live blog team as we try not to miss any. Here’s our recap of day 14, when half of Britain remembered how exciting hockey can be (the other half knew already) and the greatest athlete continued to be the greatest athlete. The big picture It’s nine golds for Usain Bolt as he motored Jamaica home in the men’s 4x100m in laughably brilliant style. That’s the triple treble – 100m, 200m and 4x100m in three successive Games – and, he says, the end of his Olympic career. A special note for pedantic readers (you’re my favourites) – you’ll see a lot of “triple triple”s flying about, but I’m sticking with “triple treble” and the man himself confirms it:\nJapan’s men zoomed into a surprising second place in that men’s 4x100m, but the relays were dotted with disqualifications. The US men completed their celebratory lap before learning the bronze was not theirs: the Mike Rodgers-Justin Gatlin baton swap was outside the zone, and Canada found themselves with an extra medal. Team GB topped their 4x400m men’s relay heat but won’t be in today’s final after they too exchanged the baton in the wrong place and were disqualified. Trinidad and Tobago’s men managed their own unique double, disqualified from both the 4x100m final and the 4x400m heats. Disqualification isn’t the end, though (I mean, technically it is, most of the time). The US women’s 4x100m team, out of the final then in again, ended up with the gold medal ahead of Jamaica and Team GB. You should also know: Germany beat Sweden 2-1 to win their first women’s football gold. Brazil to play for pride not revenge in men’s football final. Rio Paralympics to be downsized amid disappointing ticket sales. Gunnar Bentz: Ryan Lochte shouted at guards during gas station incident. Picture of the day\nTeam GB roundup A final, a penalty shoot-out: the omens weren’t good but the result was. Team GB’s women emerged golden and glorious over the Netherlands in the hockey final, winning the shootout 2-0 after the match ended 3-3. Unbeaten in Rio, the team made history in all sorts of ways: the first women’s hockey gold for Britain, and the first same-sex married couple (captain Kate and Helen Richardson-Walsh) to win Olympic gold. History too for Nick Skelton, at 58 the second oldest British gold-winner (but you have to go a long way back – 1908 – for the oldest), as he leapt remarkably to the top of the podium for individual showjumping. In seven Games he’s now collected two golds – and a broken neck and a hip replacement along the way – and he says he’ll keep going as long as his horse, Big Star, keeps jumping.\nAin’t that a kick in the head: Lutalo Muhammad was leading in the men’s -80kg taekwondo until – literally; abandon suspicions of hype – the final second. The foot of Ivory Coast’s Cheick Sallah Cissé made contact with Muhammad’s helmet and that was that: Ivory Coast’s first gold, and silver for Britain. It was one up on Muhammad’s 2012 bronze but he was heartbroken, weeping in his post-bout interview as he apologised (no need!) to spectators who’d stayed up late to watch him. Insomniacs would also have caught a bronze in the women’s 4x100m: Asha Philip, Desiree Henry, Dina Asher-Smith and Daryl Neita ran it in 41.77s and nabbed Britain’s first women’s sprint relay medal for 36 years. The sleepless will be rewarded tonight as Mo Farah runs in the 5,000m at 1.30am BST, with Team GB’s women (if not the disqualified men) taking up the baton for the 4x400m after that. Those with less stamina can still catch Tom Daley and Nicola Adams earlier in the day (see diary below). Team GB to return to victory parades in Manchester and London. Joe Joyce reaches super-heavyweight boxing final. Hockey: Twitter reacts to ‘one of the best moments of the Games’. Australia team roundup Chloe Esposito describes herself as “chronically indecisive so I do modern pentathlon”. Luckily, she does it decisively well. Esposito took gold in the women’s quintet of fencing, swimming, show jumping, pistol shooting and cross-country running – Australia’s first ever Olympic medal in the discipline – recovering from seventh place before the final round to emerge as champion. Her brother Max Esposito will be gunning for a second in the men’s event today, if only because it’s really annoying when your siblings beat you.\nJust weeks after he was finally presented with the gold medal he should have worn at London 2012 (the belated disqualification of Russian drug cheat Sergey Kirdyapkin bumping him up from second place), Jared Tallent won a silver in Rio in the 50km walk. He was briskly ahead with five minutes to go but, as Tallent put it, “ just ran out of legs” and lost out to Slovakia’s Matej Toth, who had retained his legs to the last. One gold, two silvers and a bronze make Tallent Australia’s most decorated Olympic athletics competitor. In the women’s pole vault, Alana Boyd only just – having hit the same heights but with one more miss than third-placed Eliza McCartney of New Zealand – failed to win a medal. It was boo-hoo time for the Boomers, who crashed out 87-61 in the semi-finals of the men’s basketball. Their vanquishers? Serbia, whose women’s team knocked Australia out at the quarter-final stage. Serbia (men’s) now face the mighty Team USA on the final day of the Games; the Boomers scrabble for bronze against Spain at 11.30am on Rio’s Sunday morning (that’s 12.30am Monday AEST for the really committed). And no BMX medals will be coming home after high hopes Caroline Buchanan (who crashed out in the women’s semi-final) and Sam Willoughby (sixth in the men’s final) went up and over and out. Australian athletes questioned by police in Rio over basketball accreditation. Emma McKeon will march in closing ceremony after apology for Rio night out. Team Australia day 14 roundup. Team USA roundup Three golds counts as a lull when you’re top of the leaderboard, although there was a highlight in the commanding victory for the US women in the 4x100m relay final they nearly didn’t make. An impressive (understatement) team of Tianna Bartoletta, Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Tori Bowie – three of them already with Rio medals stashed in the locker – saw off Jamaica and Britain in 41.01s. Felix, now the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals, incredibly gets another go at besting that in the 4x400m finals today. The US women qualified fastest, do I need to add?\nIt looked as if the women’s gold would be paired with a bronze by the men’s sprint team before they were turfed out of their 4x100m finals for a baton-swap mishap. Bartoletta, Felix, Gardner and Bowie will instead have to compare golds with the women’s water polo team, who fended off Italy 12-5 in their final. Connor Fields swiped gold on his way to men’s BMX victory, too. Alise Post took silver in the women’s BMX, as did Sandi Morris in the women’s pole vault. Men’s basketball semi-final: USA beat Spain 82-76. Diary All times below are local to Rio: here’s the full day 15 timetable tweaked for wherever you are. Or add four hours for UK, add 13 hours for eastern Australia; subtract one hour for east-coast US and four for west coast. Seven golds to watch for in athletics: the women’s high jump at 8.30pm; men’s javelin at 8.55pm; men’s 1,500m at 9pm; women’s 800m at 9.15pm (is Caster Semenya unbeatable here?); men’s 5,000m at 9.30pm (COME. ON. MO.); the women’s 4x400m relay at 10pm; and the men’s 4x400m relay at 10.35pm. Britain’s Nicola Adams will be after the double in her women’s flyweight gold bout against France’s Sarah Ourahmoune at 2pm. Two other boxing finals: the men’s bantamweight at 2.15pm and men’s middleweight at 3pm.\nThe men’s 10m platform diving semi-finals jump off at 11am, with the final at 4.30pm. Britain’s Tom Daley qualified first. Team USA take on Spain in the women’s basketball final at 3.30pm. And it’s the final, too, of the women’s handball: that one, also at 3.30pm, is France v Russia. Men’s football sees Brazil v Germany in the final at 5.30pm. Honduras and Nigeria scrap for bronze at 1pm. It’s China v Serbia in the women’s volleyball final at 10.15pm. Netherlands and the US play for bronze at 1pm. The men’s water polo washes up with a Croatia v Serbia final at 5.50pm. The badminton concludes with the men’s singles gold match; China or Malaysia will win that one. They’re sprinting through the canoeing finals with four today: the men’s kayak single 200m at 9.07am (featuring GB’s silver medallist Liam Heath); men’s canoe double 1,000m at 9.22am; women’s kayak four 500m at 9.47am; and the men’s kayak four 1,000m at 10.12am. The women’s triathlon gets going at 11am. It’s the first outing for cycling of the mountain bike variety, with the women’s cross-country at 12.30pm. The final round of the women’s golf – shall I? Yes – tees off at 7am. South Korea’s Inbee Park leads NZ’s Lydia Ko in the standings. It’s the final of the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around at precisely 4.59pm. Five heats of the men’s modern pentathlon conclude at 6pm. Australia’s Max Esposito is under pressure after his sister Chloe took gold in the women’s. Two taekwondo finals: the women’s +67kg at 10pm – Britain’s Bianca Walkden is world champion and would like to be there – and the men’s +80kg at 10.15pm. The penultimate day of wrestling closes with two finals in the men’s freestyle 86kg and 125kg. Sportspersonship of the day There was drama in the men’s 50km walk as Japanese athlete and third-placed finisher Hirooki Arai was disqualified and then reinstated. Which meant Canada’s Evan Dunfree was – all too briefly – a bronze medal-winner. He explained why he decided not to appeal against the decision: Even if an appeal to CAS [court of arbitration for sport] were successful I would not have been able to receive that medal with a clear conscience and it isn’t something I would have been proud of. I will sleep soundly tonight, and for the rest of my life, knowing I made the right decision. I will never allow myself to be defined by the accolades I receive, rather the integrity I carry through life. Tweet of the day When Team USA had a second shot at qualifying for the finals of the women’s 4x100m – and blitzed it – it was China that was shunted off the start list. Still, they’re taking news that they were bumped for the eventual winners in good spirit. Ish.\nIf today were a swing classic It would have to be Dean Martin’s Ain’t That a Kick in the Head.

The remote Olympic Stadium, away from the main Olympic Park, has been a factor, but Coe said it was important not to leave white elephants (which followers of London’s Olympic Stadium saga might find a mite ironic). He also insisted it had been a good week for his beleaguered sport despite the doping controversies and patchy crowds: “We’ve learned our sport is alive and incredibly strong with a great appetite for public consumption.”</p> <p>He also promised to take action on suspicious qualifying times, amid concerns that some countries were gaming the system, and look again at “transfer of allegiance” after revealing that there were recently 24 transfers to new countries in a single day.</p> <p>Finally, he said he wanted to offer Usain Bolt a job when he retires. I’m sure he won’t be the only one.</p> <p>“With all the things he will go on to do, I am very keen for him to carve out some space to help us develop the sport, and not only in an ambassadorial role. He has a broader role he can play. When the time does come, we really want him to stay in the sport,” Coe said. <br /></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b8e947e4b0377cf11189b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T23:35:54.830Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Barney Ronay was at the Maracana for that dramatic shootout</strong>.

Among the crowds at the entrance here there’s’s a group of very friendly middle aged women offering “Abrazo gratis” or free hugs. After I’d had my ten minutes they asked me “Do you believe in Jesus son?” I thought about it, then said “Yes, I do, he’s grown into this tournament and looks to have a finish in both feet”. They wept openly. </p> <p>With apologies to every other sport, this watered down clash of the giants is going to be the biggest event of these Games for Brazil. Bars in every street in every city will be packed out tonight as Brazil play out their frankly baffling obsession with Olympic football. It will be down to Neymar, Gabriel Jesus and the excellent Gabigol to see Brazil through this trauma, with defeat grisly prospect for the home fans. Serge Gnabry, Max Meyer and Lars Bender are likely to play for Germany. On a separate note I once again successfully smuggled a bottle of water past the stadium guards by including a “dummy” empty bottle in my bag which i can then ruefully surrender post x-ray machine. That’s how you’re going to beat them Butch. They keep on underestimating you. <br /></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b8b4e1e4b0377cf1118924\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T19:52:40.153Z\">8.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A brilliant strike from Russia takes their lead out to 19-15 but France again pull one back.

Three experts on the BBC couldn’t come up with an answer and UK Athletics seem content to limit themselves to a tweet about the failed appeal. It sounds a lot like the athletics establishment might even be a little embarrassed - I mean, why else would no-one make a clear statement? I thought there have been successful appeals regarding out of lane infringements where no advantage was gained. What did GB do that broke the rules to their advantage (or someone else’s disadvantage)? I recommend the lottery that is the Modern Pentathlon Show Jumping this afternoon (10pm finish).

I haven’t seen it, but I can’t see how any of us went outside those zones.”</p> <p>Their disqualification meant Brazil advance to the final instead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BritAthletics/status/766849431211798528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately our appeal against the Men&#39;s 4x400m DQ has not been successful. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rio2016?src=hash\">#Rio2016</a></p>&mdash; British Athletics (@BritAthletics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritAthletics/status/766849431211798528\">August 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T08:38:08.065Z\">at 9.38am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57b80a5be4b047b85f601e0b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T07:47:16.552Z\">8.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Post-event Olympic high-jinx among Olympians have gained a certain notoriety in recent days – Ryan Lochte and pals, those Australian athletes getting into bother with the police – but Max Whitlock hasn’t been off duty (don’t try this yourselves, kids):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Whitlock\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Needed to get a picture like this up the top of Sugarloaf mountain &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rio2016?src=hash&quot;&gt;#rio2016&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Olympics&quot;&gt;@Olympics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VrBXUITOBw&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/VrBXUITOBw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Max Whitlock (@maxwhitlock1) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maxwhitlock1/status/766748287609233409&quot;&gt;August 19, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b805e6e4b0b7e649001600\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T07:30:15.012Z\">8.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some stuff to peruse, while we wait:</p> <p>A natty interactive of how Jamaica brought home the gold in the 4x100:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2016/aug/20/how-usain-bolt-secured-the-triple-treble-with-jamaica-in-the-4x100m\">How Usain Bolt secured the triple treble with Jamaica in the 4x100m relay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>GB hockey’s Kate Richardson-Walsh on bowing out at the top after that emotional shoot-out victory over the Netherlands:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/olympic-medal-wife-hockey-team-gb-gold\">‘To win an Olympic medal with your wife standing next to you is so special’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And a nice little vignette from Clive James on the compelling joy of the Olympics and Rio in general:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/20/clive-james-watched-everything-rio-gymnasts\">Clive James: ‘I watched everything at Rio, far into the night, cycle races and gymnastics’</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57b80222e4b0377cf1118645\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-20T07:24:37.543Z\">8.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Morning everyone</strong>, from the other side of the world (That London).

The US men completed their celebratory lap before learning the bronze was not theirs: the <strong>Mike Rodgers</strong>-<strong>Justin Gatlin </strong>baton swap was outside the zone, and Canada found themselves with an extra medal.</p> <p>Team GB topped their 4x400m men’s relay heat but won’t be in today’s final after they too exchanged the baton in the wrong place and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/19/rio-2016-olympics-day-14-usain-bolt-relays-team-gb-hockey-women-football-live?page=with:block-57b7a789e4b047b85f601ce3#block-57b7a789e4b047b85f601ce3\">were disqualified</a>.

She would not commit to any plans for the future in the afterglow of her winning her second gold medal but, at 33, the four-year stretch ahead to Tokyo seems a long and difficult journey and, as she said, “this is a tough process”. Adams had only to win three bouts here, after a bye at the start of the tournament, and her opponent – who is retiring at 34 – was having her fourth contest but both were fresh and unmarked. Adams, now the European and world champion and double Olympic gold medallist, bridled at the suggestion that this might have been an easier assignment than in London, where she won her first gold – and the first by a woman in the short history of the sport.\n“Definitely not,” she said. “I had to qualify like everybody else. It’s tough, because everyone wants to go to the Olympic Games. Every time you beat someone, you’re crushing their dreams.

She would not commit to any plans for the future in the afterglow of her winning her second gold medal but, at 33, the four-year stretch ahead to Tokyo seems a long and difficult journey and, as she said, “this is a tough process”. Adams had only to win three bouts here, after a bye at the start of the tournament, and her opponent – who is retiring at 34 – was having her fourth contest but both were fresh and unmarked. Adams, now the European and world champion and double Olympic gold medallist, bridled at the suggestion that this might have been an easier assignment than in London, where she won her first gold – and the first by a woman in the short history of the sport.\n“Definitely not,” she said. “I had to qualify like everybody else. It’s tough, because everyone wants to go to the Olympic Games. Every time you beat someone, you’re crushing their dreams.

Then she rattled off a thank-you list that included her mother, brother, coach and fans.</p> <p>Adams looked extraordinarily relaxed walking to the ring but revealed later: “I’m always very nervous for every competition I have and I use that nervous energy when I get into the ring. It gives you an adrenaline rush and it lets you know that you’re taking it seriously and you’re not just going to walk through it.”</p> <p>She could hardly have made a brighter start, picking her spot with wicked precision and judging the distance to perfection – until she walked smack into a solid right near the end of the session, followed by a right hook. Yet she did enough to shade the points.</p> <p>She knocked the French boxer off balance at the start of the second but did not spoil her work by rushing in. When she caught her with a stinging head shot on the ropes, however, Adams did not waste the opportunity and whaled in two-fisted. Ourahmoune again did her best work in the closing moments of the round. All three judges saw it for Adams and the Parisian southpaw was in a deal of bother.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/aug/20/rio-2016-olympics-day-15-mo-farah-relays-tom-daley-nicola-adams-football-live\">Rio 2016 Olympics: goodbye to Bolt with triple treble, hello to GB hockey gold – live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The exchanges grew more lively in the third. Adams, working behind a piercing jab, looked good in centre ring, where she had room to do her boxing, but was caught a couple of times on the retreat. Ourahmoune slipped to the floor with 30 seconds left but was throwing enough to catch the attention of the officials and clawed a round back. It seemed an odd call, however.</p> <p>It was still a competitive fight, with both boxers aware that their entire careers were reduced to the final two minutes of an engaging if scrapping final. It was not pretty and they were both cautioned for some untidy work inside. Ourahmoune seemed the major culprit but she did not lack for spirit. In a lively conclusion she landed a couple of long right hands and took a pair of uppercuts to the body in return.</p> <p>There was huge mutual respect and both embraced at the end, champions in their sport and worthy finalists.</p> <p>While Ourahmoune had already declared this was her farewell, Adams was equivocal.</p> <p>“I’m going to take a holiday, come back and then decide what’s next.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"248b09c460616b29c270da718fe44e12e4a878d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/248b09c460616b29c270da718fe44e12e4a878d0/0_48_2182_1309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Adams lands a crushing blow to Sarah Ourahmoune’s head on her way to another Olympic gold medal for Great Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Adams lands a crushing blow to Sarah Ourahmoune’s head on her way to another Olympic gold medal for Great Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever she does – acting, coaching or boxing on – she will do it with the biggest smile in the room.

Some might push the case for Harry Mallin – unbeaten in more than 300 bouts and back-to-back gold medals in Antwerp and Paris – or Dick McTaggart, the stylish Scot who won gold and bronze, as well as 610 of his 634 contests.
