The FTSE has had a more cautious start, but found its feet as the morning went on and soared through the 6700 level. However, the UK blue-chip index is still lagging behind some of its continental and US equivalents.</p> <p>The FTSE is still around 1.5% below the May highs, whereas the S&amp;P500 and DAX are 7% above their equivalent levels. The relative under-performances by the mining sector and financials have caused some drag for the FTSE in recent months, but if US strength continues it can surely only be a matter of time before the UK index sets fresh highs for the year.</p> <h2>US markets</h2> <p>Another day, another all-time high for the Dow Jones. The opening on Wall Street saw the Dow push through the 16,000 level, giving a year-to-date performance of 22%.</p> <p>These are impressive gains by any normal measure, and it can be tempting to feel that a top cannot be too far away. Many fingers have been burnt this year trying to predict that major turning point. But for now at least, with an accommodative central bank, it appears that investors are more afraid of missing out on gains than of losing in any immediate downturn.</p> <p>Some would see this sort of psychology as warning enough that the enthusiasm is starting to get out of hand.</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJones_IG/statuses/402477083282407424\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Here are the IG closing market comments: <a href=\"http://t.co/ja4x6dtD8K\">http://t.co/ja4x6dtD8K</a></p>— David Jones (@DavidJones_IG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJones_IG/statuses/402477083282407424\">November 18, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528a4e89e4b0f15d741f60c0\" class=\"block is-summary\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T17:40:17.837Z\">5.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <h2 class=\"block-title\">European stock markets close higher</h2> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f3425539-8777-4e87-91a9-df89e3d6a962\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/18/1384796384062/972273a4-305d-499c-a119-9954254b749d-460x275.jpeg\" alt=\"The curve of the German share price index DAX board, is pictured at the Frankfurt stock exchange November 18, 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>The DAX board at the Frankfurt stock exchange today.

There would be new property rights for farmers, and an easing of restrictions on where people can work.</p> <p>Beijing is also proposing a shakeup of how state-owned firms are run, and also wants to encourage partnerships between private firms and public ones.</p> <p><strong>Just the kind of initiatives to please the stock markets, in fact.</strong> But there's one serious caveat that might have been downplayed -- these are proposals, not new policies ready to be implemented.&nbsp;</p> <p>There's good analysis on this over on Bloomberg:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-17/china-s-bold-contradictory-reform.html\"><strong>China’s Bold, Contradictory Reform</strong></a></p> <p>Here'a a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The plan calls for results by 2020. Putting the ideas into effect will involve every level of government and multiple layers of China’s labyrinthine bureaucracy. Liberalization threatens vested interests and will be met with resistance. Good results are by no means guaranteed.</p> <p>Another reason to withhold judgment is that the party statement undoubtedly envisions a more market-based economy -- yet not what one might call a normal country with a normal system of government. Its statement is rife with the contradictions that flow from this.</p> <p>The Communist Party frowns on what it calls contradictions, and it constantly dedicates itself to eliminating them more boldly -- but the anomalies it has in mind are labor disputes, street protests and “emergencies on the Internet.” The jarring tensions between state and liberty, state and market, and one-party rule and democracy are barely noted in the document, much less confronted or resolved.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T17:08:02.082Z\">at 5.08pm GMT</time></p> </div> <div id=\"block-528a4071e4b05b42ae1b6994\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T16:30:54.253Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p><strong>Camilla Sutton</strong>, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, confirms that China's latest economic reform plans are pushing shares up in many markets.</p> <p>She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Risk appetite is strong... after details of China's reform prove more dramatic than expected, suggesting a focus on market liberalization and reforms in both the government role and the broader corporate structure.</p> </blockquote> <p>(<em>via Reuters</em>)</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528a3af9e4b02747f7fb8e5f\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T16:08:55.222Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>The US dollar has lost ground against the euro today, dropping 0.2%, meaning €1 is now worth $1.3526.</p> <p>Again, the prospect of the Federal Reserve maintaining the flow of easy money is driving market sentiment.</p> <p><strong>Here's more from Christopher Vecchio&nbsp;</strong>of DailyFX:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US Dollar continues to edge lower in the days after Federal Reserve Chairwoman nominee Janet Yellen’s Senate testimony on Thursday, as the soon-to-be most powerful woman in the world made clear her intentions to keep monetary policy as loose as possible in the near-term.</p> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-528a39cbe4b05b42ae1b698a\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-18T16:04:54.101Z\">4.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>US investors have got one eye on the upcoming release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting, on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>Those minutes will show how many Fed committee members see a case for tapering (cutting) its $85bn/month QE programme, and how many want to leave it alone for some time.</p> <p><strong>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets</strong> doesn't expect much new clarity, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite the focus on the latest minutes it remains quite likely that they won’t tell us too much that we don’t already know given Janet Yellen’s comments last week.
