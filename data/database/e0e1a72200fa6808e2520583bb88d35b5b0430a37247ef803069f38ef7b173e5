As the other festivals  spent the past few months carving up this year's headliners, it seemed Michael Eavis would be left begging for scraps. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Eminem, the Kings Of Leon, the Killers, the Stone Roses, Justin Timberlake <em>and</em> My Bloody Valentine and Elton John had all been booked in exclusive deals that would prevent them stepping foot on Worthy Farm.</p><p>In the end, things didn't turn out too badly. No Fleetwood Mac, as had been rumoured (ahem), but Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons are eight very safe pairs of hands when it comes to headline slots, and the Rolling Stones, who Eavis was presumably able to afford using a Groupon voucher, do seem to represent a coup.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's the inclusivity of the event, rather than the headliners, that most impresses. A few years ago Eavis appeared on the BBC News channel's interview programme <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/6766839.stm\" title=\"\">Hardtalk</a>. The presenter, Stephen Sackur, comfortable with taking politicians to task on corruption and hypocrisy, looked ridiculous on the farm porch trying to apply the same tactics. He demanded, with Paxman-esque persistence, to know why Eavis thought such a lineup of mixed messages was appropriate. Kylie and U2? Surely you can't please everyone? Eavis just chuckled.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-376111495\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1019162776001_110624Glastothreewords-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110624Glastothreewords/110624Glastothreewords.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>What Glastonbury excels at is pleasing everyone. It may not be the anti-establishment hotbed of yore, but Britain's unfashionable subcultures do get taken care of. The tent's not only big enough for twentysomething indie fans and the old hippies but all the weirdos in between. For instance, turn-of-the-century underground ravers get to enjoy cult garage DJ Maurice Fulton, while survivors of acid house's second wave will be treated to a set from originator of hip house Tyree Cooper.</p><p>As Britain swings towards US-style ID stringency, the festival is also one of the few places where children are afforded the same good times as adults – 13-year olds are free to roam through the fire-pits of Arcadia at 5am with no one checking what they're swigging on. And UK garage obsessives  Disclosure, baby-faced troubadour King Krule and Odd Future head honchos Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, all of whom were born in the 90s, will provide some high-quality children's entertainment.</p><p>Then, as the bill expands, you'll see the music of enviromental protestors represented on the solar-powered  Croissant Neuf stage, with nu-folky Sixth Formers added to the lineup of the Strummerville campfire. And if that makes you a bit sick in your mouth, good. Having something for everyone doesn't mean you have to like everything.</p><p>That said, some musical genres are notable by their absence: reformed Britpop also-rans; Vegas-playing  brostep DJs; either of the Gallagher brothers. Glastonbury has taken the right tack by leaving that sort of thing to the V festival.</p><p>What makes me think Glastonbury still stands up for the counterculture, however, isn't so much who's on the bill, but the sight of the bill itself. There was no orchestrated social media countdown to the announcement, no flashy YouTube video of the acts who had been announced. Instead, just <a href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/2013-line-up-revealed\" title=\"\">a single image listing all the bands who have so far confirmed chucked up on the Glastonbury website</a>. It was a mess: about nine different fonts, some pointless clip-art down the side and the Rolling Stones' name printed the same size as I Am Kloot's. To those that fear Glastonbury has become a corporate husk, this sponsorship-free low-resolution jpeg should be of some comfort.</p>","headline":"Glastonbury 2013: a lineup proving you can keep

As the other festivals  spent the past few months carving up this year's headliners, it seemed Michael Eavis would be left begging for scraps. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Eminem, the Kings Of Leon, the Killers, the Stone Roses, Justin Timberlake <em>and</em> My Bloody Valentine and Elton John had all been booked in exclusive deals that would prevent them stepping foot on Worthy Farm.</p><p>In the end, things didn't turn out too badly. No Fleetwood Mac, as had been rumoured (ahem), but Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons are eight very safe pairs of hands when it comes to headline slots, and the Rolling Stones, who Eavis was presumably able to afford using a Groupon voucher, do seem to represent a coup.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's the inclusivity of the event, rather than the headliners, that most impresses. A few years ago Eavis appeared on the BBC News channel's interview programme <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/6766839.stm\" title=\"\">Hardtalk</a>. The presenter, Stephen Sackur, comfortable with taking politicians to task on corruption and hypocrisy, looked ridiculous on the farm porch trying to apply the same tactics. He demanded, with Paxman-esque persistence, to know why Eavis thought such a lineup of mixed messages was appropriate. Kylie and U2? Surely you can't please everyone? Eavis just chuckled.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-376111495\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1019162776001_110624Glastothreewords-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110624Glastothreewords/110624Glastothreewords.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>What Glastonbury excels at is pleasing everyone. It may not be the anti-establishment hotbed of yore, but Britain's unfashionable subcultures do get taken care of. The tent's not only big enough for twentysomething indie fans and the old hippies but all the weirdos in between. For instance, turn-of-the-century underground ravers get to enjoy cult garage DJ Maurice Fulton, while survivors of acid house's second wave will be treated to a set from originator of hip house Tyree Cooper.</p><p>As Britain swings towards US-style ID stringency, the festival is also one of the few places where children are afforded the same good times as adults – 13-year olds are free to roam through the fire-pits of Arcadia at 5am with no one checking what they're swigging on. And UK garage obsessives  Disclosure, baby-faced troubadour King Krule and Odd Future head honchos Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, all of whom were born in the 90s, will provide some high-quality children's entertainment.</p><p>Then, as the bill expands, you'll see the music of enviromental protestors represented on the solar-powered  Croissant Neuf stage, with nu-folky Sixth Formers added to the lineup of the Strummerville campfire. And if that makes you a bit sick in your mouth, good. Having something for everyone doesn't mean you have to like everything.</p><p>That said, some musical genres are notable by their absence: reformed Britpop also-rans; Vegas-playing  brostep DJs; either of the Gallagher brothers. Glastonbury has taken the right tack by leaving that sort of thing to the V festival.</p><p>What makes me think Glastonbury still stands up for the counterculture, however, isn't so much who's on the bill, but the sight of the bill itself. There was no orchestrated social media countdown to the announcement, no flashy YouTube video of the acts who had been announced. Instead, just <a href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/2013-line-up-revealed\" title=\"\">a single image listing all the bands who have so far confirmed chucked up on the Glastonbury website</a>. It was a mess: about nine different fonts, some pointless clip-art down the side and the Rolling Stones' name printed the same size as I Am Kloot's. To those that fear Glastonbury has become a corporate husk, this sponsorship-free low-resolution jpeg should be of some comfort.</p>","headline":"Glastonbury 2013: a lineup proving you can keep

plans 250 hours of live music online and 34 hours of TV coverage with programmes on BBC1 for the first time","hasStoryPackage":"true","lastModified":"2014-05-21T21:50:48Z","body":"<p>The BBC has promised Olympic-sized coverage of this year's Glastonbury festival with 250 hours of live music online and programmes on BBC1 for the first time.</p><p>The BBC's controller of pop music Bob Shennan said it would be the \"first truly digital Glastonbury experience\" with live coverage from six stages, including the flagship Pyramid stage, streamed online.</p><p>Shennan said the corporation had \"learned a lot\" from its experience covering the London Olympics last year, when the games were broadcast on 24 dedicated TV channels, and would be giving the four-day festival \"everything we possibly can … to deliver the best Glastonbury experience for all our audiences\".</p><p>A total of 34 hours of TV coverage – marginally up on last year – will be split across all four of its main TV channels, kicking off with The One Show on BBC1 on the opening Friday night.</p><p>BBC2 will be home to the festival's big acts, including this year's big headliners, the Rolling Stones, although it remains to be seen how much of the band's set the corporation will be able to broadcast with outstanding rights issues still to be settled.</p><p>The One Show co-host Chris Evans, a Glastonbury first-timer, will also present his Radio 2 breakfast show from the site, the start of 59 hours of radio coverage, up from 51 hours during the last festival in 2011.</p><p>Radio 2 will air 19 hours of music from the festival, with other coverage on Radio 1 and digital channels Radio 1 Xtra and 6 Music.</p><p>The BBC's presenting team will include Radio 1 DJs Nick Grimshaw and Greg James, 6 Music's Steve Lamacq and two of the familiar faces of its festival coverage, Radio 2's Jo Whiley and Mark Radcliffe.</p><p>Shennan said the BBC had a new four-year deal with Glastonbury organisers in place, beginning with this year's festival.</p><p>The BBC's controller for multiplatform across TV and radio, Mark Friend, said the digital landscape had changed significantly since the last festival in 2011.</p><p>Six streams of live music from six different festival stages will be available on mobile, tablets and PCs, as well as Virgin Media homes with a \"connected\" red button. A seventh roving camera will follow the BBC's presenters in the build-up to the festival on Friday.</p><p>Mobile users will be able to access the entirety of the BBC's festival coverage via the iPlayer radio app, which has been downloaded more than 2 million times.</p><p>\"Most people expect to get audio and visual content on their mobile devices when they want – tablet usage has quadrupled since the last Glastonbury,\" said Friend.</p><p>\"We are going to bring you all the action live as it happens with more than 250 hours of content covering more than 120 performances.

But it sounds as if he is going to be getting into the spirit of the festival after all.</p><p></p><p>Rather than getting helicoptered on and off the site to play the show, the Rolling Stones frontman says he is planning to camp on the Worthy Farm site in yurts with his family next month.</p><p></p><p>The 69-year-old rocker told Q magazine: \"I've got nothing else to do on Glasto weekend, and I want to spend some time with my family and have a good time as well.\" Jagger revealed that his daughters Jade and Elizabeth are in the process of sourcing yurts for the family escapade, and hinted that they may even visit after-hours raves at Shangri-La: \"I don't need [my daughters] to show me the cool places to go. I'm sure I can find some places of my own that are much cooler\" – giving rise to the tantalising possibility that Jagger could end up dancing shirtless at 4am at house venue the NYC Downlow.</p><p></p><p>Asked whether he was worried about being hassled on his family vacation, Jagger said: \"Depends where I go. I think everyone will be pretty laid back.\" The frontman said he was no stranger to camping and had been with his own children despite earning millions – although the weather was a little less unpredictable than the UK. He said he had been \"on the beach with my kids in the Caribbean, but it's just the same as Brighton – there's just less chance of bad weather\".</p><p></p><p>He told the magazine, out later this month: \"We went camping all the time when I was a kid.
