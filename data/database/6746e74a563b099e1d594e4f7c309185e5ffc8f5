As the other festivals  spent the past few months carving up this year's headliners, it seemed Michael Eavis would be left begging for scraps. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Eminem, the Kings Of Leon, the Killers, the Stone Roses, Justin Timberlake <em>and</em> My Bloody Valentine and Elton John had all been booked in exclusive deals that would prevent them stepping foot on Worthy Farm.</p><p>In the end, things didn't turn out too badly. No Fleetwood Mac, as had been rumoured (ahem), but Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons are eight very safe pairs of hands when it comes to headline slots, and the Rolling Stones, who Eavis was presumably able to afford using a Groupon voucher, do seem to represent a coup.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's the inclusivity of the event, rather than the headliners, that most impresses. A few years ago Eavis appeared on the BBC News channel's interview programme <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/6766839.stm\" title=\"\">Hardtalk</a>. The presenter, Stephen Sackur, comfortable with taking politicians to task on corruption and hypocrisy, looked ridiculous on the farm porch trying to apply the same tactics. He demanded, with Paxman-esque persistence, to know why Eavis thought such a lineup of mixed messages was appropriate. Kylie and U2? Surely you can't please everyone? Eavis just chuckled.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-376111495\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1019162776001_110624Glastothreewords-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110624Glastothreewords/110624Glastothreewords.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>What Glastonbury excels at is pleasing everyone. It may not be the anti-establishment hotbed of yore, but Britain's unfashionable subcultures do get taken care of. The tent's not only big enough for twentysomething indie fans and the old hippies but all the weirdos in between. For instance, turn-of-the-century underground ravers get to enjoy cult garage DJ Maurice Fulton, while survivors of acid house's second wave will be treated to a set from originator of hip house Tyree Cooper.</p><p>As Britain swings towards US-style ID stringency, the festival is also one of the few places where children are afforded the same good times as adults – 13-year olds are free to roam through the fire-pits of Arcadia at 5am with no one checking what they're swigging on. And UK garage obsessives  Disclosure, baby-faced troubadour King Krule and Odd Future head honchos Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, all of whom were born in the 90s, will provide some high-quality children's entertainment.</p><p>Then, as the bill expands, you'll see the music of enviromental protestors represented on the solar-powered  Croissant Neuf stage, with nu-folky Sixth Formers added to the lineup of the Strummerville campfire. And if that makes you a bit sick in your mouth, good. Having something for everyone doesn't mean you have to like everything.</p><p>That said, some musical genres are notable by their absence: reformed Britpop also-rans; Vegas-playing  brostep DJs; either of the Gallagher brothers. Glastonbury has taken the right tack by leaving that sort of thing to the V festival.</p><p>What makes me think Glastonbury still stands up for the counterculture, however, isn't so much who's on the bill, but the sight of the bill itself. There was no orchestrated social media countdown to the announcement, no flashy YouTube video of the acts who had been announced. Instead, just <a href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/2013-line-up-revealed\" title=\"\">a single image listing all the bands who have so far confirmed chucked up on the Glastonbury website</a>. It was a mess: about nine different fonts, some pointless clip-art down the side and the Rolling Stones' name printed the same size as I Am Kloot's. To those that fear Glastonbury has become a corporate husk, this sponsorship-free low-resolution jpeg should be of some comfort.</p>","headline":"Glastonbury 2013: a lineup proving you can keep

As the other festivals  spent the past few months carving up this year's headliners, it seemed Michael Eavis would be left begging for scraps. Beyoncé, Rihanna, Eminem, the Kings Of Leon, the Killers, the Stone Roses, Justin Timberlake <em>and</em> My Bloody Valentine and Elton John had all been booked in exclusive deals that would prevent them stepping foot on Worthy Farm.</p><p>In the end, things didn't turn out too badly. No Fleetwood Mac, as had been rumoured (ahem), but Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons are eight very safe pairs of hands when it comes to headline slots, and the Rolling Stones, who Eavis was presumably able to afford using a Groupon voucher, do seem to represent a coup.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's the inclusivity of the event, rather than the headliners, that most impresses. A few years ago Eavis appeared on the BBC News channel's interview programme <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/6766839.stm\" title=\"\">Hardtalk</a>. The presenter, Stephen Sackur, comfortable with taking politicians to task on corruption and hypocrisy, looked ridiculous on the farm porch trying to apply the same tactics. He demanded, with Paxman-esque persistence, to know why Eavis thought such a lineup of mixed messages was appropriate. Kylie and U2? Surely you can't please everyone? Eavis just chuckled.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-376111495\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1019162776001_110624Glastothreewords-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/110624Glastothreewords/110624Glastothreewords.m3u8\"></source>\n      </video><p>What Glastonbury excels at is pleasing everyone. It may not be the anti-establishment hotbed of yore, but Britain's unfashionable subcultures do get taken care of. The tent's not only big enough for twentysomething indie fans and the old hippies but all the weirdos in between. For instance, turn-of-the-century underground ravers get to enjoy cult garage DJ Maurice Fulton, while survivors of acid house's second wave will be treated to a set from originator of hip house Tyree Cooper.</p><p>As Britain swings towards US-style ID stringency, the festival is also one of the few places where children are afforded the same good times as adults – 13-year olds are free to roam through the fire-pits of Arcadia at 5am with no one checking what they're swigging on. And UK garage obsessives  Disclosure, baby-faced troubadour King Krule and Odd Future head honchos Tyler the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, all of whom were born in the 90s, will provide some high-quality children's entertainment.</p><p>Then, as the bill expands, you'll see the music of enviromental protestors represented on the solar-powered  Croissant Neuf stage, with nu-folky Sixth Formers added to the lineup of the Strummerville campfire. And if that makes you a bit sick in your mouth, good. Having something for everyone doesn't mean you have to like everything.</p><p>That said, some musical genres are notable by their absence: reformed Britpop also-rans; Vegas-playing  brostep DJs; either of the Gallagher brothers. Glastonbury has taken the right tack by leaving that sort of thing to the V festival.</p><p>What makes me think Glastonbury still stands up for the counterculture, however, isn't so much who's on the bill, but the sight of the bill itself. There was no orchestrated social media countdown to the announcement, no flashy YouTube video of the acts who had been announced. Instead, just <a href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/2013-line-up-revealed\" title=\"\">a single image listing all the bands who have so far confirmed chucked up on the Glastonbury website</a>. It was a mess: about nine different fonts, some pointless clip-art down the side and the Rolling Stones' name printed the same size as I Am Kloot's. To those that fear Glastonbury has become a corporate husk, this sponsorship-free low-resolution jpeg should be of some comfort.</p>","headline":"Glastonbury 2013: a lineup proving you can keep

was widely rumoured to be  the Rolling Stone most doubtful about the band's decision to play Glastonbury. But it sounds as if he is going to be getting into the spirit of the festival after all.</p><p></p><p>Rather than getting helicoptered on and off the site to play the show, the Rolling Stones frontman says he is planning to camp on the Worthy Farm site in yurts with his family next month.</p><p></p><p>The 69-year-old rocker told Q magazine: \"I've got nothing else to do on Glasto weekend, and I want to spend some time with my family and have a good time as well.\" Jagger revealed that his daughters Jade and Elizabeth are in the process of sourcing yurts for the family escapade, and hinted that they may even visit after-hours raves at Shangri-La: \"I don't need [my daughters] to show me the cool places to go. I'm sure I can find some places of my own that are much cooler\" – giving rise to the tantalising possibility that Jagger could end up dancing shirtless at 4am at house venue the NYC Downlow.</p><p></p><p>Asked whether he was worried about being hassled on his family vacation, Jagger said: \"Depends where I go. I think everyone will be pretty laid back.\" The frontman said he was no stranger to camping and had been with his own children despite earning millions – although the weather was a little less unpredictable than the UK. He said he had been \"on the beach with my kids in the Caribbean, but it's just the same as Brighton – there's just less chance of bad weather\".</p><p></p><p>He told the magazine, out later this month: \"We went camping all the time when I was a kid. Camping in France was our family holiday. And we brought baked beans with us, as we didn't trust that fancy foreign food.

A seventh roving camera will follow the BBC's presenters in the build-up to the festival on Friday.</p><p>Mobile users will be able to access the entirety of the BBC's festival coverage via the iPlayer radio app, which has been downloaded more than 2 million times.</p><p>\"Most people expect to get audio and visual content on their mobile devices when they want – tablet usage has quadrupled since the last Glastonbury,\" said Friend.</p><p>\"We are going to bring you all the action live as it happens with more than 250 hours of content covering more than 120 performances. Whatever people's tastes there will be something for you, all of this available live and on catch-up.</p><p>\"Just as we did at the Olympics and for the first time at a big music event, it will be available on PC, mobile, tablet and connected TVs, whether you are at home, work or on the go you are going to be able to get this stuff, making it really accessible and easy to find.</p><p>\"2012 was an unprecedented year of innovation for the BBC and set a new standard for live events.\"</p><p>Shennan, who is also controller of Radio 2 and 6 Music, said the BBC aimed to make the festival \"bigger than the sum of its parts\".</p><p>He said it would be part of a weekend of \"unbelievable live content\" from the BBC, along with the Wimbledon tennis championships and the British grand prix.</p><p><em>•&nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
