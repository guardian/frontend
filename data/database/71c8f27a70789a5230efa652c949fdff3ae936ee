        "body":"<p>Drawing, believes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080bbs\" title=\"\">Andrew Marr</a>, is much too important to be left to artists. Everyone should do it. The simple act of setting pencil to paper can change your life, maybe even help save it.</p><p>\"After my stroke,\" he says, sitting in his modest but stylishly done-up suburban house in London, \"I was lying in bed and just drawing pictures of the covers and the end of the bed: in a sense, nothing. But it starts you thinking, 'Oh yes, my mind's still there, I'm still engaging in the same way that I was.' I might not have the same skill because I can't move my arm properly, but the desire to do it is still there.\"</p><p>The morning is so pallid that the only colour seems to come from his collection of rollicking abstract paintings by <a href=\"http://www.alancristea.com/artist-Gillian-Ayres)\" title=\"\">Gillian Ayres</a>. Marr is nursing his left hand as he explains how his illness, and <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-21/andrew-marr-i-was-completely-delusional-about-how-ill-i-was\" title=\"\">slow recovery</a> this year, affects his ability to make pictures.</p><p>\"I can draw again all right, but because I still can't use this hand very well and it's not strong, holding the bit of paper or the notebook in one hand and drawing with the other is something I can't do. So I'll be drawing and the notebook will slip off my knees and I have to pick it up again. Sharpening pencils takes for ever. I drop things all the time, so I sit on a bench surrounded by pencils I've dropped, bits of rubber. It's a messier and slower business, but I can do it – which is great.\"</p><p>Then, in a bold thought that says a lot about him, he muses that having a stroke has actually made him a better artist. We talk about late Picasso, <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-the-death-of-actaeon\" title=\"\">late Titian</a> and late Cézanne, how they all got greater in old age; how his friend David Hockney says painting is <a href=\"http://www.redtedart.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/david-hockney-arrival-of-spring-2011.jpg\" title=\"\">an old man's game</a>. He's not old – he's 54 – but just as age made his heroes paint more wildly, his temporary loss of function has forced him to be more daring.</p><p>\"I think that, since the stroke, I've loosened up a bit because, to be honest, putting one line on a bit of paper takes me a little bit more effort than it did, so you don't want to waste the effort. And my big problem as a drawer has always been to be finickity, too dibbity-dabbity as they used to say.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419104516'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380902354721/Andrew-Marr-at-home-in-Lo-001.jpg' alt='Andrew Marr at home in London' width='200' height='271' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Andrew Marr at home in London Photograph: Phil Fisk for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Marr calls himself a \"drawer\", not an artist. In fact, the whole point of his new work, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849493345\" title=\"\">A Short Book About Drawing</a>, is that he is no artist – even though every illustration in it is drawn, painted or sketched on an iPad by him. Once, he argues, drawing was the basis of fine art. Today, it's barely taught by art schools, but that's a liberation for the rest of us: we can draw without having to judge the results as art.</p><p>Why should we spend our free time doing that instead of eating crisps and watching TV? Because, Marr believes, drawing – or any kind of skilled manual effort – frees you from the exhausting emptiness of modern life. He's amused when I say the book has \"moral fervour\". But it does. He tells me how western society with its obsessive consumerism and endless distractions totally misunderstands the nature of happiness. A truly happy life, he thinks, does not come from vacant chilling out: \"It's not going and lying on a fucking beach, you know? It's not just lolling about. I think it comes from making things and being connected to the rest of the world.\"</p><p>He cites the American political philosopher Matthew Crawford who now works as a motorcycle mechanic and whose book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/case-working-hands-michael-crawford\" title=\"\">The Case for Working With Your Hands</a> argues that to be whole people, we have to make things. Yet Marr's belief that drawing is a life-enhancing discipline (he jokes about \"the zen of drawing\") would equally have delighted the Victorian socialist art critics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/24/art\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/20/in-praise-of-william-morris\" title=\"\">William Morris</a>, who shared his belief that modern society has lost touch with what matters.</p><p>\"When you are doing something that you've got some inclination or talent towards, but which is not easy, and you're therefore completely concentrating on making something – that is, I think, when most people are happiest.\" For a farmer in touch with nature or a drawer sketching a tree, \"there's a dignity and a purpose to life, which you don't get from working in a call centre or being on television.\"</p><p>He laughs. Marr is not being vain in publishing his drawings: he makes no grand claims for them even though he has drawn seriously all his life and even considered going to art school, instead of Cambridge. \"I still wonder if I might have been better off going to art college,\" he says.</p><p>In terms of happiness? \"Yes.\"</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849493345\" title=\"\">A Short Book About Drawing</a>, by Andrew Marr, is published by Quadrille</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419096149|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|20d856a0f81074b4b4f5098a6f56c10d89bf21e8 -->",

        "headline":"French museum makes bid to recover lost paintings of first world war",
        "body":"<p>The tranquil scene, a young boy about to bathe at the bend of a river, hangs in the museum of a small town in northern France as if nothing more upsetting than an occasional duster had ever happened to it. Almost a century ago, as the trenches of the first world war snaked ever closer, it was crated up by German soldiers and moved by truck from Douai to a nearby town, then in the last chaotic months sent by barge and train to Brussels together with most of the greatest treasures of the Douai museum.</p><p>That painting by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Shepherd Bathing, was returned after the war and is now one of the stars of the <a href=\"http://www.corotdanslalumieredunord.fr/\" title=\"\">museum's major new exhibition</a> of work by the artist and local contemporaries. However more than 250 paintings from the collection which also vanished in 1918 have never been seen since.</p><p>\"It is truly a mystery why nobody has ever inquired about these missing works before,\" said Anne Labourdette, the young director of the Musee de la Chartreuse. \"The situation with the second world war is very well understood, but with the first world war this is really an untold story. I think in Douai there was so much pain over what happened that for many years people did not want to think about it. And for my predecessors, when some reparation money was paid by Germany perhaps it was more interesting to build a new collection than look for what was lost.\"</p><p>She became director seven years ago and launched the hunt, with researchers and art historians who have recently become interested in the story, uncovering a secret agenda where some Germans wanted French paintings as hostages for the return of German art siezed by Napoleon a century earlier.</p><p>She will soon publish the first inventory of the museum collection in 1914, what was taken but returned in 1919, and what vanished forever. She has recovered three pictures, including a lovely Jules Breton which she managed to block being sold in New York, but major missing works include a harvest scene possibly by Rubens, and a mermaid claimed to be by the 15th century German artist Lucas Cranach.</p><p>Striking photographs, probably taken by the British in October 1918, show the museum's ransacked galleries, floors littered with empty frames. A solitary landscape still hanging over a door was ironically destroyed in second world war bombings.</p><p>Douai is only a few miles from the Belgian border, and in 1914 the Germans took over as a base for troops for the front, organising entertainments and establishing German only shops. It was a point of pride that the museum stayed open. Later the best from Douai and other towns was moved slightly further from the front to Valenciennes to protect it, where the Germans organised a showcase exhibition with an illustrated catalogue which has proved invaluable. Finally it was moved again to Brussels, where after the war the authorities tackled the mammoth task of identifying and returning warehouses full of art.</p><p>Labourdette has found reports of losses at each stage, but the saddest fate awaited the pictures judged second rate by the Germans and left behind in Douai – mainly the \"petits maitres\", local artists including friends and those directly influenced by Corot's luminous paintings which would certainly have hung in the new exhibition.</p><p>As the Germans abandoned the town in September 1918, blowing up buildings, bridges, roads and train lines, the museum was looted, its paintings slashed out of their frames and rolled into kit bags or slung into trucks.</p><p>\"We have no idea where these works are,\" Labourdette said. \"Some must have been destroyed, but not all. Somebody must know where they are. This story is not over.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419188242|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|fd5afe7dcb471475aa3e3808ad10a75f713dab57 -->",

        "body":"<p>Tommy Hindley, who has died from a brain tumour aged 66, covered many Olympic Games – from Moscow 1980 onwards – and was a regular at World Cup football tournaments, but he was most celebrated for his shots of grand slam tennis matches. His images are displayed at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon and were regularly published in the Guardian, the Observer and many other publications.</p><p>Tommy had worked as the official Tottenham Hotspur photographer for a long time before starting to freelance at the Observer. One of his early commissions from the paper was to cover the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in 1989. His poignant picture of the ensuing disaster, depicting the victims laid out on the pitch, was used on the Observer's front page the next day.</p><p>Born in Hackney, east London, Tommy was the only child of Thomas and Catherine Hindley. He often said he had to bring himself up as his father spent much of Tommy's childhood in a sanatorium suffering from TB and his mother had to work long hours in a clothing factory to support them.</p><p>Throughout his life Tommy seemed to thrive on adversity. He would not surrender to the gangs of boys from neighbouring Tottenham or his opponents on the football pitch or, much later, sports stars such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/john-mcenroe\" title=\"\">John McEnroe</a>, who at the 1983 French Open kicked one of Tommy's lenses. \"You cannot be serious, John!\" Tommy screamed back.</p><p>After leaving Lordship Lane Secondary Modern, Tottenham, Tommy worked in Fleet Street as a messenger and, one day, had the cheek to walk into one of the broadsheets and ask for a job as a photographer. He was told politely to come back when he could do the job.</p><p>He managed to get some part-time evening work teaching at the London College of Printing (now the London College of Communication). Fortunately, his partner, Jan, whom he went on to marry in 1981, had a good job in the City and an old secondhand Mini so she paid all the bills and drove them around.</p><p>I played a small part in his change of fortunes in the late 1970s. I had just got a start on the Guardian and needed somebody to look after my local paper contracts when I saw Tommy's advert looking for work in the <a href=\"http://www.bjp-online.com/\" title=\"\">British Journal of Photography</a>. It turned out that we lived around the corner from each other and Jan was soon driving Tommy to Enfield Town FC, Saracens rugby club and Southgate hockey on wet, dark Saturday afternoons.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419183643'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/6/1381063900029/Tommy-Hindley-sports-phot-009.jpg' alt='Tommy Hindley, sports photographer, with camera' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Tommy Hindley was the official Tottenham Hotspur photographer before starting to freelance at the Observer</figcaption></figure><p>He would shoot everything on a handful of rolls of film and then print and deliver to the local papers personally by deadline, often in the middle of the night. Soon they were delivering to the national papers. Jan remembers: \"I would wait in Fleet Street, with the engine running usually (in case my Mini broke down), while Tommy ran up and handed the photos to the picture desk.\"</p><p>In 1977 he formed his own agency, <a href=\"http://tommyhindley.com/about.html\" title=\"Tommy Hindley's Professional Sport picture agency\">Professional Sport</a>, which has since won many awards. He secured high-profile contracts with the Lawn Tennis Association and the All England Club and was presented with a 2010 Tennis Europe award by Derek Howorth, then president of the LTA. He was chairman of the International Tennis Photographers Association for many years and was also a member of the Sports Journalists' Association.</p><p>His first Olympics came at Moscow in 1980, and his son Julian remembers working with him at the Athens Games of 1996, when they scooped the front pages of many papers with a shot of Kelly Holmes bringing home a gold medal for Great Britain. \"Dad got the shot and I ran (almost probably as fast as Kelly) to transmit the picture he literally threw across the track to me on a disc.\"</p><p>Last year was the pinnacle for Tommy as the Olympics were staged in his home town. It had all come full circle for the boy from the East End, and again he was on hand to take striking shots.</p><p>Tommy is survived by Jan and their children, Julian, Faye and Giles.</p><p>• Thomas Valentine Hindley, photographer, born 20 June 1947; died 18 September 2013</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419179293|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|7fb59f5694097b2621bba2043a33bc794a348d1f -->",

        "body":"<p>He is the anonymous street art vigilante who uses the nondescript walls of cities to stage million-dollar exhibitions. In many places around the world, Banksy's graffiti art, with its strong political motifs, has become a cultural symbol and a community treasure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/02/bansky-arrives-new-york-street-art-residency\">This month he is in New York</a>, for what is expected to be a month-long residency featuring several new projects. </p><p>However, with great artistic acclaim and value comes a surge in commercialization. Many of Banksy's murals – prized greatly by art fans but even more so by private property owners – have been displaced and auctioned. In Los Angeles in August, a Banksy Flower Girl piece was removed from a gas station and put up for auction. The starting bid was $300,000. In February, <a href=\"link http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/11/banksy-slave-labour-mural-row-sale\">a piece entitled Slave Labour</a> disappeared under mysterious circumstances from a North London Poundland store, only to turn up in a Miami auction later that month, with an asking price of $700,000.</p><p>And then there are the Banksy pieces that have been put at risk simply because of their public nature. In Bristol, Gorilla in a Pink Mask was painted over by a building's new owners, who thought it was just a vandal's graffiti. In New York this week, Banksy's first mural was tagged by other artists within hours – before being erased entirely.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419181710'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381065085579/Banksy-art-painted-over-N-008.jpg' alt='Banksy art painted over New York' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A piece in Manhattan's Lower East Side on Allen Street was painted over less than 24 hours after it was put up. Photograph: Alexander Ayer/Barcroft USA</figcaption></figure><p>Regarding such threats of removal or damage to public art, cities are faced with two questions: should they protect the art? And if so, how? Banksy's murals are most often public art drawn – illegally, in some cases – on private property. This raises issues of ownership and preservation.<br /> <br />Amy Adler, professor of art law at New York University, suggests that \"amendments to planning legislation are therefore a possible next step\", in order to empower public authorities to preserve art in public spaces. </p><p>In Los Angeles, legal proceedings were brought when a large mural by the artist Ed Ruscha, on private land, was suddenly painted over. This was one of the few instances in which a work of public art was protected under federal visual artists rights regulations, preserving the work even if the ownership of the physical property changes. </p><p>Adler contends, however, that in Banksy's case, \"for this to apply, Banksy himself would have to file for protection, which given his penchant for anonymity and illegality of his graffiti, he does not do\".</p><p>When a mural has been put on a publicly owned space, local authorities have greater power to decide what to do – in some cases, they have taken on the task of preservation themselves. In 2006, Bristol city council polled residents when a Banksy image appeared on a public clinic: 97% said they wanted it to stay. </p><p>However not everybody agrees that the art should be preserved. In New York, authorities reacted less kindly to a Wall Street rat painting, critical of corporate America, and Let Them Eat Crack was ordered to be painted over. Banksy's Pulp Fiction bananas suffered the same fate after Transport for London claimed it employed \"cleaners and not professional art critics\".</p><p>\"If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art,\" Robert Davis, the chairman of Westminster Council's planning committee, said at the time. \"To go and deface other people's property is graffiti. Just because he's famous doesn't give him that right.\" </p><p>Steven Thomas, a partner at the Irell &amp; Manella law firm in LA, lends supports to this stance, as \"the moral rights of Banksy are trumped by the fact trespass on the property took place. The building owner or local council can do as they wish\".</p><p>Local governments find themselves powerless when the piece is on private property, where the retention depends on the owner. The recent removal of Slave Labour from a convenience store wall in London was a sting to the local community who regarded it as a source of pride to an otherwise degenerate area. The local Haringey Council protested that public works should not be for private enjoyment. It was eventually sold in London, though not reinstalled on the wall.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419181709'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381064472173/Banksy-in-New-York-008.jpg' alt='Banksy in New York' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Street art reading 'Playground Mob, The Musical', allegedly done by the Banksy, is seen in the Lower East Side. Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In 2011 John Webster of the University of Bristol, in Banksy's home town, suggested the addition public art to national historic registries. In the US, though, the National Register of Historic Places considers pieces of \"historical interest or great artistic value\", but only after at least 50 years. The UK only considers significant work after 15 years – but does protect it under a National Trust Lottery fund. Webster therefore proposes that an extension to criteria would have to be considered to incorporate protection for future generations.</p><p>Regarding the situation in the US, Phillipa Loengard, director at the Columbia Kernochan Center for Law and Arts, says: \"The problem with the register is that the whole building would have to be listed resulting in more bureaucracy with developers and owners.\" </p><p>She cites a recently overturned ordinance by the Los Angeles city council that now allows street artists to paint murals in public. </p><p>\"Cities should instead adopt something like the California Civil Code 989 which allows any community group to ask for protection by the building owner, if they fundraise for the preservation.\" </p><p>The legislation requires \"recognized quality\" and \"substantial public interest\" which is yet to be tested, but this could prove to be the way forward for many different communities.</p><p>Successful preservation has happened when local groups work directly with the artists and property owners to come to an agreement – something which is hard to do with a mysterious artist like Banksy. </p><p>Adler says: \"The real problem we have is the rich irony of cultural preservatio. The intention of the work is social change and vandalism. By trying to preserve it, it is contrary to the ethos of the work and subversive street culture.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419137912|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|508bda66000232e84f3f23db9fe835ee293d42b8 -->",

        "headline":"Art Under Attack: Histories of British Iconoclasm – review",
        "body":"<p>An image, wrote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer\" title=\"\">Albrecht Dürer</a>, \"is no more responsible for superstitious abuse than a weapon is responsible for a murder\". Don't blame the gun, blame the homicidal lunatic who fires it – Dürer's argument about art, more than 500 years ago, is strangely similar to that of the US gun lobby today. Images are not inherently dangerous, he claims, they do not have the power to rouse people to passion, still less idolatry or violence. Only a maniac or a criminal would attack a work of art.</p><p>It is easy to see the logic of this view, which is still prevalent. After all, its dark obverse is that any work of art that has suffered some kind of assault may have provoked or deserved it. The attack occurred because the sculpture unhinged him; the picture terrified her; the portrait looked at her in the wrong way.</p><p>And oddly enough, when someone savaged the eyes of <a href=\"http://www.pinakothek.de/en/albrecht-duerer/self-portrait-fur-trimmed-robe\" title=\"\">Dürer's great 1500 self-portrait</a> in 1905, the museum authorities took precisely this line. Why were the eyes attacked, they asked in the annual report, if not because of the way they looked at the attacker \"with their alarmingly penetrating stare\"?</p><p>Art Under Attack – the subject of <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/art-under-attack-histories-british-iconoclasm\" title=\"\">this riveting show</a> at Tate Britain – begins with iconoclasm and ends with destruction as \"an act of creation\" (think <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://artobserved.com/artimages/2013/06/1_Sad-presentiments-of-what-must-come-to-pass.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://artobserved.com/2013/06/new-york-jake-and-dinos-chapman-insult-to-injury-at-yoshii-gallery-through-june-29th-2013/&amp;h=1024&amp;w=1225&amp;sz=525&amp;tbnid=WLyZa9Q92frNEM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=108&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Djake%2Band%2Bdinos%2Bchapman%2Bgoya%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=jake+and+dinos+chapman+goya&amp;usg=__OW2FqV7TEDy6z4-9x4AKo1-27xk=&amp;docid=UhA-4IqYG2r8AM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oxRLUrSmCKqY0QWqnYHoBA&amp;ved=0CEAQ9QEwAw\" title=\"\">Jake and Dinos Chapman</a>). This last section feels irrelevant and entirely unnecessary. The impulse to attack works of art is so various, so common, so inconsistent and bizarre the curators could have devoted many more galleries to the history of destruction and still not reached the end of their exploration.</p><p>Iconoclasm proper, for instance, involves the purging of religious images. If militant Protestants believed that graven images were sinful, idolatrous, that they might lead to lasting damnation, you'd think they might have been more comprehensive in their appalling destructiveness.</p><p>But though the show is full of tortured medieval figures – Jesus beheaded, Joseph blinded, the Virgin's nose hacked from her face – these sculptures remain unimpeachably recognisable. Christ in Majesty (particularly targeted, it seems, during the reign of His Majesty Henry VIII) may have lost his head, but the absence of the right arm holding the book and the enthroned pose immediately identify the sculpture to the faithful.</p><p>And looking at the magnificent limestone sculpture of the <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/statue-dead-christ-on-loan-first-time-tate-britain-mercers-hall\" title=\"\">Dead Christ</a>, which was only discovered last century in the ground beneath the Mercers' Hall in London, one wonders if something in the art itself held the iconoclasts back. The body lies upon its bier, the size of life and fully as profound, poor mouth agape and stone blood freezing in the wounds. The feet, the arms and the crown of thorns are gone, but the attackers did no more damage to the face.</p><p>Iconoclasm suggests extreme violence and, sure enough, there are wild axe marks and frenzied stabbings in this show. It took brute force to lop the hands off a stone Christ – and just think how extraordinary that the perpetrators were Christians themselves – but the damage could also be laboriously programmatic.</p><p>The show contains a contemporary painting of the 1644 destruction in Canterbury Cathedral – workers methodically shattering the high windows with pikes while Puritans in tall hats keep a strict clock-watch below. Pews were used to fuel the furnace in which the lead traceries were melted down, statues were chunked for reuse as masonry; the recycling was ruthlessly efficient.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419112053'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/2/1380725482234/Statue-of-the-Dead-Christ-010.jpg' alt='Statue of the Dead Christ from the Mercers' Company.' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>‘The size of life and fully as profound’: Statue of the Dead Christ from the Mercers' Hall, London. Photograph: Marcus Leith and Andrew Dunkley</figcaption></figure><p>And yet at the same time the eyes of religious figures were being scratched out of paintings or gouged from statues specifically so that they could no longer make contact with worshippers. Eyes were regarded as having the power to move. Orders were given to \"utterly extinct and destroy\" such images \"so that there remains no memory of same\". No memory, no vision – nothing to affect the viewer.</p><p>Iconoclasm, vandalism: these are held to be abnormal, philistine, superstitious or as crazy as Dürer might have it. But the middle sections of this show test all these beliefs. The toppling of public statues, for instance, is practically a political tradition the world over.</p><p>Who would puzzle over the felling of George III's statue in America during the war of independence or the eventual removal – after a century of bearing down from a great height – of Nelson's statue in Dublin? Who does not understand the potency of painting the leader's hands red, giving him horns, or putting a placard round his neck to make him apologise? None of this seems remotely aberrant.</p><p>The motive for destructive acts is rarely philistine either. Sometimes the violence is even committed by artists themselves in defence of art. <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/carl-andre-648\" title=\"\">Carl Andre</a>'s <em>Equivalent VIII</em> was attacked by a painter who thought that modern art ought to be better than bricks; Damien Hirst's <em>Away From the Flock</em> – the lamb in formaldehyde – was stained with black ink as a form of creative \"improvement\" by another artist.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/sculptors/12802.shtml\" title=\"\">Reg Butler</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/butler-final-maquette-for-the-unknown-political-prisoner-l01102\" title=\"\"><em>Unknown Political Prisoner</em></a> was attacked by a Hungarian who believed that if the prisoner represented the suffering of real people during the second world war then he ought to be made out of something more dignified than scrap metal. Reg Butler ought to start over. The protest was matched to the motive.</p><p>Each of these instances makes one think again about the nature of art and of our relationship with it; this is what makes Art Under Attack so vividly stimulating. Of course the show has its exceptions. When <a href=\"http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/yale/summary/v013/13.2otten.html\" title=\"\">Mary Wood</a> slashed John Singer Sargent's portrait of Henry James in 1914, the attack had nothing to do with (and nothing to say about) either the artist or the writer, whose books she had not read, and it's not obvious that it furthered the suffragette cause in any way. Nor are the documents and photographs interesting.</p><p>On the other hand, the very fact that Wood attacked a portrait – and not, say, a landscape – has its peculiar&nbsp;significance. When it comes&nbsp;to iconoclasm, the damage is almost always done to representations&nbsp;of people as if they were surrogate persons.</p><p>To attack images as if they were real or alive – it sounds the most primitive of instincts. But before one rejects the idea as purely superstitious, consider the close connection between people and portraits. Some kind of special relationship is universally felt to exist between the two, for instance, such that even adults plant kisses on images, carry them like champions through the streets, are excited by them – or as angered by them – as they might be by living beings. You don't see the same thing happening with still lifes.</p><p>Dürer, whose 1500 self-portrait has inspired both love and fear down the centuries, may be right to argue that works of art cannot be responsible for acts of human violence. But it's wrong to think that art does not have the strength to move or provoke, to enrage or inspire, and not just admiration but passion or loathing. The attacker acts upon these feelings, inexcusably, but he or she is reacting to something that many people (and indeed many museums) ignore, namely the power of art to affect us.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418866693|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|1ebe4202a935b054b93f3fbeab044fed998a9092 -->",

        "headline":"The unholy row over Hawksmoor's London masterpiece",
        "body":"<p>A new building for an inner-city primary school is completed, an addition to its premises that is for the use of nursery-age children and is also meant to serve as a community centre for the adult population. The project is a collaboration between the diocese of London, an Anglican rector, and a school whose children are mostly Muslim. The building has been designed by respected architects who won the commission in a competition, and has been approved by planners and English Heritage. Yet the building stands empty and unused, because a group of local residents and architectural experts, assisted by its lawyers, argues that it breaches acts of parliament. They would, ideally, like the new building to be demolished, and years of work and about £1m worth of construction to be binned.</p><p>This seems incomprehensible, coming – as it does – from a group of serious, well-intentioned people; but this is an unusual location: the new building at Christ Church primary stands, like a dinghy beside a liner, next to the sheer white, south elevation of Nicholas Hawksmoor's <a href=\"http://www.spitalfieldsvenue.org/\" title=\"\">Christ Church, Spitalfields</a>, one of the greatest – most powerful, most original, most moving – architectural creations in London. The school building, say the <a href=\"https://www.christchurchspitalfields.org/\" title=\"\">Friends of Christ Church</a>, defaces the setting of Hawksmoor's work, which has been carefully and expensively restored. The view of its south wall, they say, should be unobstructed. They also object to the fact that it stands in what was once the church's graveyard, and later became public gardens, and that it occupies what should be open space.</p><p>This spot has been built on before – a 70s youth centre was demolished to make way for the school building. But, say the Friends, this youth centre was only ever intended to be temporary (this point is disputed) and should not be used as a precedent for a permanent structure. As the Friends have led the campaign which raised many millions to restore the church, they feel their views matter. One of them describes the diocese's actions as \"parking their tanks on our lawn\". Their anger seems personal, as if their own property had been infringed.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113794'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380913604144/Christ-Church-Spitalfield-001.jpg' alt='Christ Church Spitalfields' width='460' height='298' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The front aspect of Hawksmoor's Spitalfields church. Photograph: Antonio Olmos</figcaption></figure><p>Claims and counterclaims fly. The building is a \"vanity project\" say the Friends, and there is no need for its community space; the diocese's response is \"we're trying to provide the opportunities that children and families deserve\". The school might close soon, say the Friends; not so, says the diocese. The Friends say they were consulted too little and too late; the diocese says \"there was an enormous amount of consultation\".</p><p>The objectors have on their side the Hawksmoor expert Professor Kerry Downes, Christopher Woodward, co-author of <em>A Guide to the Architecture of London</em>, and Eleanor Mitchell, the architect of the 70s youth centre. They have opposed the project for three years, objecting unsuccessfully as it passed through planning, and are now mounting a legal challenge. They claim the construction contravenes the Open Spaces Act and Disused Burial Grounds Act, and that the last breach is a criminal offence. The diocese of London, the London borough of Tower Hamlets, and the rector of Christ Church, say the Friends, had no right to build, or permit to be built, anything on the site, and they are going to court to try to prove it.</p><p>Yet visiting the empty building, I fail to share their outrage. In itself it is a well-made, well-considered work – a \"barn\", as its architects call it, that rises from a low perimeter, scaled to the size of infants, to a spacious central hall. It has a satisfyingly sturdy timber structure, and big glass walls that afford views through to the surrounding greenery. It is both protective and open, intimate and generous. It also uses materials such as re used stock bricks, with a plum tinge, laid with a garden wall bond. This is an attempt to echo the old walls and houses that huddle close to this and other Hawksmoor churches.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419113796'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380801125633/spitalfields-2-001.jpg' alt='spitalfields 2' width='460' height='275' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The school's airy, light interior. Photograph: Studio Cullinan and Buck Architects Ltd</figcaption></figure><p>The architects of the project, Jon Buck and Dominic Cullinan of <a href=\"http://www.scabal.net/\" title=\"\">Scabal</a>, argue that its controversial position is the best available. Yes, they could have built it on a bit of playground, squeezing it between mature plane trees and the windows of adjoining properties, but this would have meant laying replacement play areas, with artificial sports pitches and metal fences, at the feet of the church. More important, they say, the place chosen means that the new building can act as both a boundary and portal for the school. It protects the play spaces, but also welcomes people approaching from the side of the churchyard gardens.</p><p>The core of the matter, architecturally, is whether the flank walls of Hawksmoor's churches are set pieces that demand to be seen completely unimpeded, and whether their relationship to their graveyards is an essential and unalterable part of their concept. I would say not: while the buildings themselves are determined and consistent, their surroundings, including those of Christ Church, have always been more loose and elastic. Open space has expanded and contracted, neighbouring buildings have come and gone – the force of the white stone churches lies in their persistence among change.</p><p>As for the argument about open space, it might indeed have been questionable to build something new on what had previously been green, but the existence for 40 years of another structure, the youth centre, does make a difference, and it is arguable whether some more grass or asphalt would be of greater public benefit than what is now being offered.</p><p>The objectors (some of whom know more about Hawksmoor than I do) disagree, and theirs are valid opinions. They have been aired through the processes of planning permission, although they did not prevail. The Friends also have a right to point out that they think public authorities have acted illegally, and if they have a case the courts should examine it. But the point at which they press for demolition is the one at which their campaign looks merciless. There are greater outrages against the fabric of British cities with which to do battle.</p><p>As for the old graveyard of Christ Church, what it requires now is coherent transformation of its landscaping, within which the new school building might stand as a pavilion. Rather than fight legal battles, the Friends, the diocese and other interested parties should concentrate on achieving this.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418956526|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|47564039f6c60bc7bab44a84158d9c6a987bb4ec -->",

        "headline":"Top British war artist launches assault on 'elite' Frieze art fair",
        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://friezelondon.com\" title=\"\">Frieze art fair</a>, which opens for business next week, is a success story for its founders, for artists and for commercial galleries. But those artists and galleries who are consistently left out of the annual event complain it creates a chill wind for everyone else.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.johnkeaneart.com/mainframes.html\" title=\"\">John Keane</a>, who was appointed as the official Gulf war artist by the Imperial War Museum in 1994, believes that Frieze is too selective and has an unhealthy relationship with the contemporary art establishment, particularly Tate Modern. There is now an inner circle, he argues, that puts other visual artists at a disadvantage.</p><p>\"While Frieze is going on it is hard for anyone else to be seen,\" he said this weekend. \"All the newspapers cover the same shows and you tend to see the same artists' names coming up at the Tate, Hayward and Whitechapel galleries.\"</p><p>Keane, who is probably best known for his 2002 <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw57442/Mo-Mowlam\" title=\"\">portrait</a> of the late politician Mo Mowlam, which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery, believes that the system allows a small group of private galleries to benefit from the public support of a nationally funded gallery, such as Tate Modern, that receives money each year to buy new work at the fair.</p><p>\"It is almost like a supermarket sweep,\" said Keane. \"The Tate is allowed in early to look for the best stuff. It might be exciting, and I congratulate Frieze for becoming so successful, but if you happen to be outside the loop it doesn't look quite so good.\"</p><p>Frieze began 11 years ago and takes place every autumn in Regent's Park, London. It has since branched out, with an annual venture in New York starting two years ago and a sister show, Frieze Masters, that allows galleries to sell work from previous eras.</p><p>\"I have never had any work in the show, although I have been working as an artist for a long time now and making a reasonable living. I have a good relationship with a gallery too,\" said Keane, who shows his work at the Flowers Gallery, where his exhibition Fear opens on 19 October. It was inspired by Simon Sebag Montefiore's book about Stalin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/20/biography.features\" title=\"\"><em>The Court of the Red Tsar</em></a>, and Keane believes it is some of the best work he has created.</p><p>The Flowers Gallery was established in 1970 by Angela Flowers and it has never been included in Frieze, despite having applied several times. \"My gallery has been told not to bother applying any more,\" said Keane. \"As I say, it is to its credit that Frieze has been a huge success. The trouble is it pretty much soaks up all the interest and no one else gets coverage.\"</p><p>For Matthew Slotover, the co-founder of Frieze, Keane's charges are undeserved. Slotover, who does not vote on which galleries are included in the fair, believes there is an effort to present a cross-section of the best.</p><p>\"The fair is open to everyone to apply, and we have a changing committee from around the world who decide who is accepted – and we get more than three times the number of applicants to accepted galleries,\" he said. \"The make-up of the fair does change each year, so I always encourage people to apply.\"</p><p>On 17 October the Tate will reveal the works it has bought from this year's fair through the <a href=\"http://friezelondon.com/tate-fund/\" title=\"\">Outset/Frieze art fair fund</a> at a special event held in Tate Britain. The fund was founded in 2003 to support new art and is sponsored by Le Méridien Hotels &amp; Resorts, with extra funding this year from Leviev Extraordinary Diamonds. Each year guest curators from abroad join four Tate curators to help in the selection process.</p><p>\"Outset's work in championing emerging and re-emerging artists has become a vital component of the contemporary art world,\" said the Tate's director, Nicholas Serota, last week.</p><p>Slotover says there is no formal relationship between the Tate and Frieze: \"Tate is given £150,000 from Outset to buy works directly from galleries at Frieze. These are chosen by two independent museum curators in association with Tate.\"</p><p>He points out that art museums often buy works from Frieze, as well as from other fairs such as <a href=\"http://www.tefaf.com/\" title=\"\">Tefaf</a> and<a href=\"https://www.artbasel.com/\" title=\"\"> Art Basel</a>, and that the Tate still buys most of its acquisitions elsewhere.</p><p>Keane, however, believes that many artists feel they are excluded from a privileged group. As an artist who is drawn to political subject matters, he is used, he said, to feeling outside the loop.</p><p>\"Because Frieze is selective it means that money for Outset is spent on an exclusive club. I think this limits plurality,\" Keane said. \"What I would like to ask Matthew Slotover is: 'Can I join your exclusive club, please?'\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419140104|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|653b860b77d41a269c089283a82fa49a05e8dbc2 -->",

        "body":"<p>Last winter, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/klee\" title=\"\">Paul Klee</a> Centre in Berne had a brilliant idea for an exhibition. They partnered a large selection of works by&nbsp;Klee with a broad sampling of the work of Klee's contemporary, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Itten\" title=\"\">Johannes Itten</a>. When I saw it at the Martin-Gropius-Bau museum in Berlin, it was quietly devastating. Itten is one of those figures always referred to as \"very interesting\" by art historians, meaning almost the opposite. He was a&nbsp;contemporary of Klee's, and, briefly, a&nbsp;colleague when they both taught at the Bauhaus in its Weimar years from 1919. Itten was a curious person: he led a mystical religious movement at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/27/bauhaus-art-as-life-barbican\" title=\"\">the Bauhaus</a> called Mazdaznan, whose followers wore purple robes and ate nothing but garlic (Alma Mahler said that you could tell when you had walked past a Bauhaus student in those early years). Both Klee and he were somewhat mystically inclined, and thought deeply about the significance of colour. Both were restless creators, and their work changes dramatically every two or three years. They ought to be very good companions in a gallery survey.</p><p>Instead, you felt intensely sorry for Itten. Every shift in style in Itten's work was expertly achieved, closely argued-for and deathly dull. His grid-pattern abstracts are so tedious they give the impression of boring even their creator. Strikingly, every time Itten moves from one pictorial manner to another, he seems to leave everything behind. There is nothing that would convince you that one of his 1960s abstracts, such as <em>Adieu</em> (1965) was painted by the same artist that reduced a leaning woman to a&nbsp;pattern of lines in <em>Woman with Birds</em> (1945) or a&nbsp;still life of vases in 1922. There is no character there at the core. But Klee has an irreducible centre, and though he changed his style and approach many times in the 40&nbsp;years of his mature career, there is always something there that makes you say \"Klee\" without hesitation. When Klee appears in a photograph, I've observed that even people who don't recognise him&nbsp;are drawn to his extraordinary, warm, humorous face – there is an unforgettable one of him with his Great&nbsp;War regiment, his expression turning the spiked Pickelhaube he wears into a moment of pure comedy. His work is much the same. At the calm centre of his enormous fantasy, there is&nbsp;an ego-denying self, looking outwards into the world.</p><p>It is a colossal body of work, catalogued in the first instance by Klee himself. The Tate's survey focuses on the key exhibitions that marked the development of Klee's career, and shows the public face of the development of his art. His relationship with his public is a gripping subject, and includes such unwilling representations as the Nazis' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/16/secondworldwar\" title=\"\">Degenerate Art</a> exhibitions. To penetrate into the deeper, private movements of Klee's thought and imagery, some consultation of his own catalogue, and the recent, still more extensive, catalogue raisonné, is&nbsp;indispensable. From 1911, he began to inventory every item of his work, going back to drawings he had made when he was three or four years old. From then until his death in 1940, he&nbsp;catalogued almost everything he produced, numbering it and ascribing it to a year. The huge and magnificent catalogue raisonné produced in Berne by the Paul&nbsp;Klee Foundation consists of&nbsp;nine volumes, accounting for 9,800 drawings, prints, paintings and illustrations: the backbone of it is Klee's orderly cataloguing habit. I&nbsp;have them, and they are thrilling volumes to read through, watching Klee burst out into something entirely new, developing from painting to painting. You can follow every step.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418972250'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380798624946/The-Conqueror.-Paul-Klee.-001.jpg' alt='The Conqueror.\nPaul Klee.' width='200' height='238' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><em>Conqueror</em>. Photograph: Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern</figcaption></figure><p>Take a moment in 1922. Klee was a&nbsp;first-rate musician, and music quite often surfaces in his art. Roughly in the middle of his year's production – number 142 of 260 numbered works – he goes back to music. We can see the order&nbsp;in which he created things, the direction that his mind went in, by following the works he created over a&nbsp;few days, in numbered succession. First, there is a&nbsp;colour-gradation exercise between a&nbsp;capital A and an O, called <em>Overture</em> – Klee had been teaching at the Bauhaus for about 18 months, and it seems to start from&nbsp;one of his colour exercises. Then a tiny piece of grotesquery, a drawing called <em>Brewing Witches</em>; a grotesque piece of musical comedy called <em>The Heroic Tenor as a&nbsp;Concert Singer</em>, and then three watercolours that seem to be part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;different pattern of thought, closely&nbsp;resembling each other. The mechanised tenor and his piano, a&nbsp;tiny&nbsp;mechanical box, set something off&nbsp;now, and we have an<strong> </strong><em>Old Steamboat</em>, an&nbsp;oil-transfer drawing of impressively clanking appearance. Klee apparently wanders off into something quite different; two enchanting, weightless horticultural watercolours, <em>Plants in the Moonlight</em> and <em>Project for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Garden</em>. The work of these few days seems quite exploratory, quite undirected. But then the three strands of investigation unite in the magnificent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twittering_Machine\" title=\"\"><em>Twittering Machine</em></a>. The garden; the&nbsp;clanking machinery; the vision of&nbsp;music all come together in this vision of four birds at dawn, poised on&nbsp;a&nbsp;branch as their crank is turned and&nbsp;they burst into song.</p><p>To pluck moments from Klee's work at random is to be astonished by his variety of subject and approach. The fantastical oil-transfer drawings of the early Bauhaus years are what his name calls up – it was a process he invented, and the messy, joyously splodgy line is,&nbsp;indelibly, his own. But then Klee himself thought the translucent, miniature watercolours of Tunisia from&nbsp;1914 were at the heart of his work. In his journal, whether written at the time or with subsequent reflection, he&nbsp;wrote of this moment \"Colour and I&nbsp;are one. I am a painter.\" Or there are the grand, massive games of the very last years, where strong, thick lines are&nbsp;refused permission to cross or touch, as in <a href=\"http://www.artchive.com/artchive/K/klee/insula.jpg.html\" title=\"\"><em>Insula Dulcamara</em></a> of 1938, or moments when the spray-paint techniques of the early 1920s shift into&nbsp;the centre of investigation.</p><p>There is a&nbsp;sudden interest in divisionist techniques in the Düsseldorf period of&nbsp;the early 1930s. Where does it come from? From Seurat, or from a memory of North African architecture? A key work is <a href=\"http://www.paintingiant.com/paul-klee/portal-of-a-mosque.html\" title=\"\"><em>Portal to a Mosque</em></a> in a Berlin collection, a graph-paper fantasy summoning up memories of Mamluk glasswork. The units grow smaller; the&nbsp;works ripple out into visions of landscape, like the 1932 <em>Lowlands</em> in a&nbsp;now-unknown location. For a couple of years, the divisionist fantasy is what&nbsp;a Klee looks like. Then it abruptly stops; he starts making geometrical figures out of unbroken lines and paintings and drawings out of short, feathery brush and pencil strokes. To&nbsp;be honest, I don't much like the feathery period, and Klee was glad to be out of it – it was his most fraught and least productive period, coinciding with the triumph of the Nazis. It doesn't matter. The beautiful divisionist period and the unsatisfying feathery period are over just as quickly as each other, and Klee hardly ever returns to either.</p><p>I have come to think of Klee as an exemplary artistic figure, facing outwards into the world and not painfully contemplative of the self, drawing mastery not just from his command of the medium, but from the&nbsp;struggles to&nbsp;control his tools. He&nbsp;doesn't necessarily intend to make a big statement; he often simply observes something in front of him, tenderly and exactly. (I&nbsp;never see a dog sleeping on a cushion without thinking of Klee.)&nbsp;In his career, he explores the possibilities of a particular mode or style, does what he can with it and then moves on to something quite different. Klee, you feel, could have carried on for ever. At the core of his work, however, there is something solid and irreducible that never changes, however alluringly different the surface of his work. He reminds one in a way of Stravinsky, who moved from Russian nationalist to cubist to neoclassicist to serialist without ever writing a bar of music that could be mistaken for anyone else's.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418972251'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380798511022/park-near-lu-paul-klee-001.jpg' alt='park near lu paul klee' width='200' height='286' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><em>Park near Lu</em>.

Did the man who created the minimalist landscape <a href=\"http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/paul-klee/park-bei-lu-1938\" title=\"\"><em>Park near Lu</em></a> in 1938 and the extravagant, grotesque and masterly <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=67282\" title=\"\"><em>Aged Phoenix</em></a> in 1905 possess multiple personalities? Or can we look at the vivid satire of the early engravings and that of the 1930 <a href=\"http://www.artsunlight.com/artist-NK/N-K0004-Paul-Klee/N-K0004-011-conqueror.html\" title=\"\"><em>Conqueror</em></a> and say that here is someone whose values, at bottom, never changed? What is that central, unmistakable core that Klee possessed and that Itten went without?</p><p>The core of Klee, I think, is his comedy. One of the underestimated sources of modern art is commercial, comic art, and the exchange between the newspaper \"funnies\" and the most advanced art was easier than one might suppose. Artists of the time sought inspiration outside the long tradition of academic training: some in indigenous African or South American art; some (like Klee) in the art of children; others in commercial, advertising and even comic art. The line that goes from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/aug/17/toulouse-lautrec-moulin-rouge-paintings\" title=\"\">Toulouse-Lautrec</a> to Beardsley to the Fauvistes is quite clear. Another line comes from the tradition of expressive distortion in caricature and satire into more expressionist styles – the physical distortions in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/apr/19/art.shopping\" title=\"\">Egon Schiele</a>'s portraits have precedents in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/aug/24/our-critics-arts-highlights-autumn#/?picture=415616990&amp;index=3\" title=\"\">Daumier</a>'s cartoons.</p><p>An extreme example here is the German-American artist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/06/lyonel-feininger-manhattan-bauhaus-review\" title=\"\">Lyonel Feininger</a>. After years of considerable commercial success as a comic artist for the Chicago Sunday Tribune, Feininger took the battery of distortion and simplification he had developed as&nbsp;the creator of <em>Wee Willie Winkie's World</em> into life as an expressionist painter and teacher at the Bauhaus. Klee never had a career as a comic artist in the rich satiric traditions of southern Germany and Switzerland. However, his early exercises in comic distortion and satire never went away. The early Munich images of disgruntled fish eyeing up a&nbsp;hook and line resurface years later, in a 1925 <a href=\"http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/paul-klee/fish-image-1925\" title=\"\"><em>Fish Image</em></a>, or in <em>Fish Gaze</em> from 1940 – unmistakably very stupid fish, those two – and in other treasured images of animals in their own society, such as a&nbsp;marvellously funny and tender <a href=\"http://www.vontobel-art.com/en/Klee-Paul/Kingdom-of-Birds-aid54301\" title=\"\"><em>Kingdom of Birds</em></a><em> (1918)</em>.</p><p>Underlying all of this is a dream sensibility of distortion and misogynist grotesquery. The physical presence of humans, especially in the early images, is often shockingly obscene. The disturbing 1906 <em>Puppet on Violet Ribbons</em> has prehensile feet with long fingers, and a closely delineated anus where her vagina would conventionally be. In other works of this period, animals sniff at the pudenda of women; it is not always clear whether it is the animal's mouth or the woman's genitalia that is dripping fluid. Klee was determined to explore his fantasies and deep-rooted beliefs, however bizarre. In the so-called <em>Diaries</em> – not daily records, but examinations of recalled experience – he sets down a&nbsp;startling series of vignettes from early childhood. The traditions of the grotesque image, the dream-fantasy, the rapturous contemplation of the possible and the satiric humour are wedded from Klee's earliest days. \"In&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream I saw the maid's sexual organs,\" he writes. \"They consisted of four male (infantile) parts and looked something like a cow's udder (two to three years).\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418972252'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380800108117/paul-klee-001.jpg' alt='paul klee' width='200' height='274' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Paul Klee at Possenhofen, 1921. Photograph: Felix Klee </figcaption></figure><p>The satirical grotesquery and his willingness to distort material places Klee in a comic tradition. The well-known engraving <em>Two Men Meet, Each Believing the Other to be of Higher Rank</em> depicts two emperors, Franz Joseph of&nbsp;Austria-Hungary and Wilhelm II of&nbsp;Germany, naked, bowing low. A&nbsp;small anthology could be put together of Klee's satirical jibes at power, emperors, soldiers and dictators. They include such self-explanatory pieces as <em>Pride of&nbsp;the Gatekeeper</em> from 1929 and the evil-looking <a href=\"http://nicolecarrel.net/Sea_Snail_King.html\" title=\"\"><em>Sea Snail King</em></a> from 1933. Satire stretches into beautiful design in&nbsp;the 1930 <em>Conqueror</em>. A small, geometrical figure, alone and running, bears a flag clearly too heavy for him to&nbsp;support. He seems to be running in one direction; a spear or a&nbsp;giant arrow, perhaps, is pointing in quite the other direction. He is going to&nbsp;fall over. Or,&nbsp;still more abstract, later in&nbsp;the 1930s, when the terror of the dictators had become completely clear,&nbsp;he painted the great 1939 <a href=\"http://www.picturebook-illust.com/artist/003_klee/106.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Destroyed Labyrinth</em></a>. Klee had long been drawn to&nbsp;fragments, half-signifying a lost civilisation; there are many images associated with Egyptian themes from earlier in his career. In&nbsp;<em>Destroyed Labyrinth</em> we see the remains of a&nbsp;tyrant; the walls were built to herd and harry and control people. Now they are&nbsp;in fragments; the builder's purpose is&nbsp;lost; across these small fragments, a&nbsp;child could find his way. Like all of&nbsp;Klee's later work, it is, on some level,&nbsp;a beautiful and noble statement against the tyrannies of his time. Like all of Klee's work, it does not itself dictate or control; it allows the eye to&nbsp;find its own&nbsp;way through its patterns&nbsp;and structures.</p><p>He is the artist I love best in the world: I love his modesty and his resourcefulness, and his willingness to combat oppression and violence with laughter. His work reflects the idea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/milankundera\" title=\"\"><em>Milan Kundera</em></a>, that the machinery of power works by imposing forgetfulness; that the way the individual can fight back is through laughter. At the time, nothing could have seemed more fragile and pointless a gesture against the armies of Hitler than a painting of&nbsp;fish, gawping at each other, by a&nbsp;Dessau art professor. But nothing remains of Hitler's power, and the structures he built are mostly dust. What certainly does remain are is a&nbsp;little, tender picture of a garden; a&nbsp;sheet of luminous colours; music transformed into an image.</p><p>Klee died in great pain in 1940, waiting for the Swiss state to acknowledge that he was a citizen of the country in which he was born. It&nbsp;must have seemed to him that he had died in failure, in a&nbsp;world that he could do nothing about. As the exhibition of his incomparable, funny, inexhaustible work opens at Tate Modern, we can say that here is an artist who got more right than most.</p><p>• Philip Hensher's novel about Klee at the Bauhaus, <em>The&nbsp;Emperor Waltz</em>, will be published next year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418849461|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c355c7fecf24a6ac56274714a4a4e85d54ef2380 -->",

        "body":"<p>Drawing, believes <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0080bbs\" title=\"\">Andrew Marr</a>, is much too important to be left to artists. Everyone should do it. The simple act of setting pencil to paper can change your life, maybe even help save it.</p><p>\"After my stroke,\" he says, sitting in his modest but stylishly done-up suburban house in London, \"I was lying in bed and just drawing pictures of the covers and the end of the bed: in a sense, nothing. But it starts you thinking, 'Oh yes, my mind's still there, I'm still engaging in the same way that I was.' I might not have the same skill because I can't move my arm properly, but the desire to do it is still there.\"</p><p>The morning is so pallid that the only colour seems to come from his collection of rollicking abstract paintings by <a href=\"http://www.alancristea.com/artist-Gillian-Ayres)\" title=\"\">Gillian Ayres</a>. Marr is nursing his left hand as he explains how his illness, and <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-09-21/andrew-marr-i-was-completely-delusional-about-how-ill-i-was\" title=\"\">slow recovery</a> this year, affects his ability to make pictures.</p><p>\"I can draw again all right, but because I still can't use this hand very well and it's not strong, holding the bit of paper or the notebook in one hand and drawing with the other is something I can't do. So I'll be drawing and the notebook will slip off my knees and I have to pick it up again. Sharpening pencils takes for ever. I drop things all the time, so I sit on a bench surrounded by pencils I've dropped, bits of rubber. It's a messier and slower business, but I can do it – which is great.\"</p><p>Then, in a bold thought that says a lot about him, he muses that having a stroke has actually made him a better artist. We talk about late Picasso, <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-the-death-of-actaeon\" title=\"\">late Titian</a> and late Cézanne, how they all got greater in old age; how his friend David Hockney says painting is <a href=\"http://www.redtedart.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/david-hockney-arrival-of-spring-2011.jpg\" title=\"\">an old man's game</a>. He's not old – he's 54 – but just as age made his heroes paint more wildly, his temporary loss of function has forced him to be more daring.</p><p>\"I think that, since the stroke, I've loosened up a bit because, to be honest, putting one line on a bit of paper takes me a little bit more effort than it did, so you don't want to waste the effort. And my big problem as a drawer has always been to be finickity, too dibbity-dabbity as they used to say.\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419104516'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/4/1380902354721/Andrew-Marr-at-home-in-Lo-001.jpg' alt='Andrew Marr at home in London' width='200' height='271' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Andrew Marr at home in London Photograph: Phil Fisk for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Marr calls himself a \"drawer\", not an artist. In fact, the whole point of his new work, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849493345\" title=\"\">A Short Book About Drawing</a>, is that he is no artist – even though every illustration in it is drawn, painted or sketched on an iPad by him. Once, he argues, drawing was the basis of fine art. Today, it's barely taught by art schools, but that's a liberation for the rest of us: we can draw without having to judge the results as art.</p><p>Why should we spend our free time doing that instead of eating crisps and watching TV? Because, Marr believes, drawing – or any kind of skilled manual effort – frees you from the exhausting emptiness of modern life. He's amused when I say the book has \"moral fervour\". But it does. He tells me how western society with its obsessive consumerism and endless distractions totally misunderstands the nature of happiness. A truly happy life, he thinks, does not come from vacant chilling out: \"It's not going and lying on a fucking beach, you know? It's not just lolling about. I think it comes from making things and being connected to the rest of the world.\"</p><p>He cites the American political philosopher Matthew Crawford who now works as a motorcycle mechanic and whose book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/case-working-hands-michael-crawford\" title=\"\">The Case for Working With Your Hands</a> argues that to be whole people, we have to make things. Yet Marr's belief that drawing is a life-enhancing discipline (he jokes about \"the zen of drawing\") would equally have delighted the Victorian socialist art critics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/24/art\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/20/in-praise-of-william-morris\" title=\"\">William Morris</a>, who shared his belief that modern society has lost touch with what matters.</p><p>\"When you are doing something that you've got some inclination or talent towards, but which is not easy, and you're therefore completely concentrating on making something – that is, I think, when most people are happiest.\" For a farmer in touch with nature or a drawer sketching a tree, \"there's a dignity and a purpose to life, which you don't get from working in a call centre or being on television.\"</p><p>He laughs. Marr is not being vain in publishing his drawings: he makes no grand claims for them even though he has drawn seriously all his life and even considered going to art school, instead of Cambridge. \"I still wonder if I might have been better off going to art college,\" he says.</p><p>In terms of happiness? \"Yes.\"</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849493345\" title=\"\">A Short Book About Drawing</a>, by Andrew Marr, is published by Quadrille</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419096149|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|20d856a0f81074b4b4f5098a6f56c10d89bf21e8 -->",

        "body":"<p>He is the anonymous street art vigilante who uses the nondescript walls of cities to stage million-dollar exhibitions. In many places around the world, Banksy's graffiti art, with its strong political motifs, has become a cultural symbol and a community treasure. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/oct/02/bansky-arrives-new-york-street-art-residency\">This month he is in New York</a>, for what is expected to be a month-long residency featuring several new projects. </p><p>However, with great artistic acclaim and value comes a surge in commercialization. Many of Banksy's murals – prized greatly by art fans but even more so by private property owners – have been displaced and auctioned. In Los Angeles in August, a Banksy Flower Girl piece was removed from a gas station and put up for auction. The starting bid was $300,000. In February, <a href=\"link http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/11/banksy-slave-labour-mural-row-sale\">a piece entitled Slave Labour</a> disappeared under mysterious circumstances from a North London Poundland store, only to turn up in a Miami auction later that month, with an asking price of $700,000.</p><p>And then there are the Banksy pieces that have been put at risk simply because of their public nature. In Bristol, Gorilla in a Pink Mask was painted over by a building's new owners, who thought it was just a vandal's graffiti. In New York this week, Banksy's first mural was tagged by other artists within hours – before being erased entirely.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419181710'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381065085579/Banksy-art-painted-over-N-008.jpg' alt='Banksy art painted over New York' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A piece in Manhattan's Lower East Side on Allen Street was painted over less than 24 hours after it was put up. Photograph: Alexander Ayer/Barcroft USA</figcaption></figure><p>Regarding such threats of removal or damage to public art, cities are faced with two questions: should they protect the art? And if so, how? Banksy's murals are most often public art drawn – illegally, in some cases – on private property. This raises issues of ownership and preservation.<br /> <br />Amy Adler, professor of art law at New York University, suggests that \"amendments to planning legislation are therefore a possible next step\", in order to empower public authorities to preserve art in public spaces. </p><p>In Los Angeles, legal proceedings were brought when a large mural by the artist Ed Ruscha, on private land, was suddenly painted over. This was one of the few instances in which a work of public art was protected under federal visual artists rights regulations, preserving the work even if the ownership of the physical property changes. </p><p>Adler contends, however, that in Banksy's case, \"for this to apply, Banksy himself would have to file for protection, which given his penchant for anonymity and illegality of his graffiti, he does not do\".</p><p>When a mural has been put on a publicly owned space, local authorities have greater power to decide what to do – in some cases, they have taken on the task of preservation themselves. In 2006, Bristol city council polled residents when a Banksy image appeared on a public clinic: 97% said they wanted it to stay. </p><p>However not everybody agrees that the art should be preserved. In New York, authorities reacted less kindly to a Wall Street rat painting, critical of corporate America, and Let Them Eat Crack was ordered to be painted over. Banksy's Pulp Fiction bananas suffered the same fate after Transport for London claimed it employed \"cleaners and not professional art critics\".</p><p>\"If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art,\" Robert Davis, the chairman of Westminster Council's planning committee, said at the time. \"To go and deface other people's property is graffiti. Just because he's famous doesn't give him that right.\" </p><p>Steven Thomas, a partner at the Irell &amp; Manella law firm in LA, lends supports to this stance, as \"the moral rights of Banksy are trumped by the fact trespass on the property took place. The building owner or local council can do as they wish\".</p><p>Local governments find themselves powerless when the piece is on private property, where the retention depends on the owner. The recent removal of Slave Labour from a convenience store wall in London was a sting to the local community who regarded it as a source of pride to an otherwise degenerate area. The local Haringey Council protested that public works should not be for private enjoyment. It was eventually sold in London, though not reinstalled on the wall.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419181709'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/6/1381064472173/Banksy-in-New-York-008.jpg' alt='Banksy in New York' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Street art reading 'Playground Mob, The Musical', allegedly done by the Banksy, is seen in the Lower East Side. Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In 2011 John Webster of the University of Bristol, in Banksy's home town, suggested the addition public art to national historic registries. In the US, though, the National Register of Historic Places considers pieces of \"historical interest or great artistic value\", but only after at least 50 years. The UK only considers significant work after 15 years – but does protect it under a National Trust Lottery fund. Webster therefore proposes that an extension to criteria would have to be considered to incorporate protection for future generations.</p><p>Regarding the situation in the US, Phillipa Loengard, director at the Columbia Kernochan Center for Law and Arts, says: \"The problem with the register is that the whole building would have to be listed resulting in more bureaucracy with developers and owners.\" </p><p>She cites a recently overturned ordinance by the Los Angeles city council that now allows street artists to paint murals in public. </p><p>\"Cities should instead adopt something like the California Civil Code 989 which allows any community group to ask for protection by the building owner, if they fundraise for the preservation.\" </p><p>The legislation requires \"recognized quality\" and \"substantial public interest\" which is yet to be tested, but this could prove to be the way forward for many different communities.</p><p>Successful preservation has happened when local groups work directly with the artists and property owners to come to an agreement – something which is hard to do with a mysterious artist like Banksy. </p><p>Adler says: \"The real problem we have is the rich irony of cultural preservatio. The intention of the work is social change and vandalism. By trying to preserve it, it is contrary to the ethos of the work and subversive street culture.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419137912|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|508bda66000232e84f3f23db9fe835ee293d42b8 -->",

        "body":"<p>The tranquil scene, a young boy about to bathe at the bend of a river, hangs in the museum of a small town in northern France as if nothing more upsetting than an occasional duster had ever happened to it. Almost a century ago, as the trenches of the first world war snaked ever closer, it was crated up by German soldiers and moved by truck from Douai to a nearby town, then in the last chaotic months sent by barge and train to Brussels together with most of the greatest treasures of the Douai museum.</p><p>That painting by Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Shepherd Bathing, was returned after the war and is now one of the stars of the <a href=\"http://www.corotdanslalumieredunord.fr/\" title=\"\">museum's major new exhibition</a> of work by the artist and local contemporaries. However more than 250 paintings from the collection which also vanished in 1918 have never been seen since.</p><p>\"It is truly a mystery why nobody has ever inquired about these missing works before,\" said Anne Labourdette, the young director of the Musee de la Chartreuse. \"The situation with the second world war is very well understood, but with the first world war this is really an untold story. I think in Douai there was so much pain over what happened that for many years people did not want to think about it. And for my predecessors, when some reparation money was paid by Germany perhaps it was more interesting to build a new collection than look for what was lost.\"</p><p>She became director seven years ago and launched the hunt, with researchers and art historians who have recently become interested in the story, uncovering a secret agenda where some Germans wanted French paintings as hostages for the return of German art siezed by Napoleon a century earlier.</p><p>She will soon publish the first inventory of the museum collection in 1914, what was taken but returned in 1919, and what vanished forever. She has recovered three pictures, including a lovely Jules Breton which she managed to block being sold in New York, but major missing works include a harvest scene possibly by Rubens, and a mermaid claimed to be by the 15th century German artist Lucas Cranach.</p><p>Striking photographs, probably taken by the British in October 1918, show the museum's ransacked galleries, floors littered with empty frames. A solitary landscape still hanging over a door was ironically destroyed in second world war bombings.</p><p>Douai is only a few miles from the Belgian border, and in 1914 the Germans took over as a base for troops for the front, organising entertainments and establishing German only shops. It was a point of pride that the museum stayed open. Later the best from Douai and other towns was moved slightly further from the front to Valenciennes to protect it, where the Germans organised a showcase exhibition with an illustrated catalogue which has proved invaluable. Finally it was moved again to Brussels, where after the war the authorities tackled the mammoth task of identifying and returning warehouses full of art.</p><p>Labourdette has found reports of losses at each stage, but the saddest fate awaited the pictures judged second rate by the Germans and left behind in Douai – mainly the \"petits maitres\", local artists including friends and those directly influenced by Corot's luminous paintings which would certainly have hung in the new exhibition.</p><p>As the Germans abandoned the town in September 1918, blowing up buildings, bridges, roads and train lines, the museum was looted, its paintings slashed out of their frames and rolled into kit bags or slung into trucks.</p><p>\"We have no idea where these works are,\" Labourdette said. \"Some must have been destroyed, but not all. Somebody must know where they are. This story is not over.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419188242|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|fd5afe7dcb471475aa3e3808ad10a75f713dab57 -->",

        "body":"<p>Last winter, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/klee\" title=\"\">Paul Klee</a> Centre in Berne had a brilliant idea for an exhibition. They partnered a large selection of works by&nbsp;Klee with a broad sampling of the work of Klee's contemporary, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Itten\" title=\"\">Johannes Itten</a>. When I saw it at the Martin-Gropius-Bau museum in Berlin, it was quietly devastating. Itten is one of those figures always referred to as \"very interesting\" by art historians, meaning almost the opposite. He was a&nbsp;contemporary of Klee's, and, briefly, a&nbsp;colleague when they both taught at the Bauhaus in its Weimar years from 1919. Itten was a curious person: he led a mystical religious movement at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/27/bauhaus-art-as-life-barbican\" title=\"\">the Bauhaus</a> called Mazdaznan, whose followers wore purple robes and ate nothing but garlic (Alma Mahler said that you could tell when you had walked past a Bauhaus student in those early years). Both Klee and he were somewhat mystically inclined, and thought deeply about the significance of colour. Both were restless creators, and their work changes dramatically every two or three years. They ought to be very good companions in a gallery survey.</p><p>Instead, you felt intensely sorry for Itten. Every shift in style in Itten's work was expertly achieved, closely argued-for and deathly dull. His grid-pattern abstracts are so tedious they give the impression of boring even their creator. Strikingly, every time Itten moves from one pictorial manner to another, he seems to leave everything behind. There is nothing that would convince you that one of his 1960s abstracts, such as <em>Adieu</em> (1965) was painted by the same artist that reduced a leaning woman to a&nbsp;pattern of lines in <em>Woman with Birds</em> (1945) or a&nbsp;still life of vases in 1922. There is no character there at the core. But Klee has an irreducible centre, and though he changed his style and approach many times in the 40&nbsp;years of his mature career, there is always something there that makes you say \"Klee\" without hesitation. When Klee appears in a photograph, I've observed that even people who don't recognise him&nbsp;are drawn to his extraordinary, warm, humorous face – there is an unforgettable one of him with his Great&nbsp;War regiment, his expression turning the spiked Pickelhaube he wears into a moment of pure comedy. His work is much the same. At the calm centre of his enormous fantasy, there is&nbsp;an ego-denying self, looking outwards into the world.</p><p>It is a colossal body of work, catalogued in the first instance by Klee himself. The Tate's survey focuses on the key exhibitions that marked the development of Klee's career, and shows the public face of the development of his art. His relationship with his public is a gripping subject, and includes such unwilling representations as the Nazis' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/16/secondworldwar\" title=\"\">Degenerate Art</a> exhibitions. To penetrate into the deeper, private movements of Klee's thought and imagery, some consultation of his own catalogue, and the recent, still more extensive, catalogue raisonné, is&nbsp;indispensable. From 1911, he began to inventory every item of his work, going back to drawings he had made when he was three or four years old. From then until his death in 1940, he&nbsp;catalogued almost everything he produced, numbering it and ascribing it to a year. The huge and magnificent catalogue raisonné produced in Berne by the Paul&nbsp;Klee Foundation consists of&nbsp;nine volumes, accounting for 9,800 drawings, prints, paintings and illustrations: the backbone of it is Klee's orderly cataloguing habit. I&nbsp;have them, and they are thrilling volumes to read through, watching Klee burst out into something entirely new, developing from painting to painting. You can follow every step.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418972250'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380798624946/The-Conqueror.-Paul-Klee.-001.jpg' alt='The Conqueror.\nPaul Klee.' width='200' height='238' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><em>Conqueror</em>. Photograph: Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern</figcaption></figure><p>Take a moment in 1922. Klee was a&nbsp;first-rate musician, and music quite often surfaces in his art. Roughly in the middle of his year's production – number 142 of 260 numbered works – he goes back to music. We can see the order&nbsp;in which he created things, the direction that his mind went in, by following the works he created over a&nbsp;few days, in numbered succession. First, there is a&nbsp;colour-gradation exercise between a&nbsp;capital A and an O, called <em>Overture</em> – Klee had been teaching at the Bauhaus for about 18 months, and it seems to start from&nbsp;one of his colour exercises. Then a tiny piece of grotesquery, a drawing called <em>Brewing Witches</em>; a grotesque piece of musical comedy called <em>The Heroic Tenor as a&nbsp;Concert Singer</em>, and then three watercolours that seem to be part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;different pattern of thought, closely&nbsp;resembling each other. The mechanised tenor and his piano, a&nbsp;tiny&nbsp;mechanical box, set something off&nbsp;now, and we have an<strong> </strong><em>Old Steamboat</em>, an&nbsp;oil-transfer drawing of impressively clanking appearance. Klee apparently wanders off into something quite different; two enchanting, weightless horticultural watercolours, <em>Plants in the Moonlight</em> and <em>Project for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Garden</em>. The work of these few days seems quite exploratory, quite undirected. But then the three strands of investigation unite in the magnificent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twittering_Machine\" title=\"\"><em>Twittering Machine</em></a>. The garden; the&nbsp;clanking machinery; the vision of&nbsp;music all come together in this vision of four birds at dawn, poised on&nbsp;a&nbsp;branch as their crank is turned and&nbsp;they burst into song.</p><p>To pluck moments from Klee's work at random is to be astonished by his variety of subject and approach. The fantastical oil-transfer drawings of the early Bauhaus years are what his name calls up – it was a process he invented, and the messy, joyously splodgy line is,&nbsp;indelibly, his own. But then Klee himself thought the translucent, miniature watercolours of Tunisia from&nbsp;1914 were at the heart of his work. In his journal, whether written at the time or with subsequent reflection, he&nbsp;wrote of this moment \"Colour and I&nbsp;are one. I am a painter.\" Or there are the grand, massive games of the very last years, where strong, thick lines are&nbsp;refused permission to cross or touch, as in <a href=\"http://www.artchive.com/artchive/K/klee/insula.jpg.html\" title=\"\"><em>Insula Dulcamara</em></a> of 1938, or moments when the spray-paint techniques of the early 1920s shift into&nbsp;the centre of investigation.</p><p>There is a&nbsp;sudden interest in divisionist techniques in the Düsseldorf period of&nbsp;the early 1930s. Where does it come from? From Seurat, or from a memory of North African architecture? A key work is <a href=\"http://www.paintingiant.com/paul-klee/portal-of-a-mosque.html\" title=\"\"><em>Portal to a Mosque</em></a> in a Berlin collection, a graph-paper fantasy summoning up memories of Mamluk glasswork. The units grow smaller; the&nbsp;works ripple out into visions of landscape, like the 1932 <em>Lowlands</em> in a&nbsp;now-unknown location. For a couple of years, the divisionist fantasy is what&nbsp;a Klee looks like. Then it abruptly stops; he starts making geometrical figures out of unbroken lines and paintings and drawings out of short, feathery brush and pencil strokes. To&nbsp;be honest, I don't much like the feathery period, and Klee was glad to be out of it – it was his most fraught and least productive period, coinciding with the triumph of the Nazis. It doesn't matter. The beautiful divisionist period and the unsatisfying feathery period are over just as quickly as each other, and Klee hardly ever returns to either.</p><p>I have come to think of Klee as an exemplary artistic figure, facing outwards into the world and not painfully contemplative of the self, drawing mastery not just from his command of the medium, but from the&nbsp;struggles to&nbsp;control his tools. He&nbsp;doesn't necessarily intend to make a big statement; he often simply observes something in front of him, tenderly and exactly. (I&nbsp;never see a dog sleeping on a cushion without thinking of Klee.)&nbsp;In his career, he explores the possibilities of a particular mode or style, does what he can with it and then moves on to something quite different. Klee, you feel, could have carried on for ever. At the core of his work, however, there is something solid and irreducible that never changes, however alluringly different the surface of his work. He reminds one in a way of Stravinsky, who moved from Russian nationalist to cubist to neoclassicist to serialist without ever writing a bar of music that could be mistaken for anyone else's.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418972251'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380798511022/park-near-lu-paul-klee-001.jpg' alt='park near lu paul klee' width='200' height='286' class='gu-image'/><figcaption><em>Park near Lu</em>.

What is that central, unmistakable core that Klee possessed and that Itten went without?</p><p>The core of Klee, I think, is his comedy. One of the underestimated sources of modern art is commercial, comic art, and the exchange between the newspaper \"funnies\" and the most advanced art was easier than one might suppose. Artists of the time sought inspiration outside the long tradition of academic training: some in indigenous African or South American art; some (like Klee) in the art of children; others in commercial, advertising and even comic art. The line that goes from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/aug/17/toulouse-lautrec-moulin-rouge-paintings\" title=\"\">Toulouse-Lautrec</a> to Beardsley to the Fauvistes is quite clear. Another line comes from the tradition of expressive distortion in caricature and satire into more expressionist styles – the physical distortions in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/apr/19/art.shopping\" title=\"\">Egon Schiele</a>'s portraits have precedents in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/aug/24/our-critics-arts-highlights-autumn#/?picture=415616990&amp;index=3\" title=\"\">Daumier</a>'s cartoons.</p><p>An extreme example here is the German-American artist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/06/lyonel-feininger-manhattan-bauhaus-review\" title=\"\">Lyonel Feininger</a>. After years of considerable commercial success as a comic artist for the Chicago Sunday Tribune, Feininger took the battery of distortion and simplification he had developed as&nbsp;the creator of <em>Wee Willie Winkie's World</em> into life as an expressionist painter and teacher at the Bauhaus. Klee never had a career as a comic artist in the rich satiric traditions of southern Germany and Switzerland. However, his early exercises in comic distortion and satire never went away. The early Munich images of disgruntled fish eyeing up a&nbsp;hook and line resurface years later, in a 1925 <a href=\"http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/paul-klee/fish-image-1925\" title=\"\"><em>Fish Image</em></a>, or in <em>Fish Gaze</em> from 1940 – unmistakably very stupid fish, those two – and in other treasured images of animals in their own society, such as a&nbsp;marvellously funny and tender <a href=\"http://www.vontobel-art.com/en/Klee-Paul/Kingdom-of-Birds-aid54301\" title=\"\"><em>Kingdom of Birds</em></a><em> (1918)</em>.</p><p>Underlying all of this is a dream sensibility of distortion and misogynist grotesquery. The physical presence of humans, especially in the early images, is often shockingly obscene. The disturbing 1906 <em>Puppet on Violet Ribbons</em> has prehensile feet with long fingers, and a closely delineated anus where her vagina would conventionally be. In other works of this period, animals sniff at the pudenda of women; it is not always clear whether it is the animal's mouth or the woman's genitalia that is dripping fluid. Klee was determined to explore his fantasies and deep-rooted beliefs, however bizarre. In the so-called <em>Diaries</em> – not daily records, but examinations of recalled experience – he sets down a&nbsp;startling series of vignettes from early childhood. The traditions of the grotesque image, the dream-fantasy, the rapturous contemplation of the possible and the satiric humour are wedded from Klee's earliest days. \"In&nbsp;a&nbsp;dream I saw the maid's sexual organs,\" he writes. \"They consisted of four male (infantile) parts and looked something like a cow's udder (two to three years).\"</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418972252'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380800108117/paul-klee-001.jpg' alt='paul klee' width='200' height='274' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Paul Klee at Possenhofen, 1921. Photograph: Felix Klee </figcaption></figure><p>The satirical grotesquery and his willingness to distort material places Klee in a comic tradition. The well-known engraving <em>Two Men Meet, Each Believing the Other to be of Higher Rank</em> depicts two emperors, Franz Joseph of&nbsp;Austria-Hungary and Wilhelm II of&nbsp;Germany, naked, bowing low. A&nbsp;small anthology could be put together of Klee's satirical jibes at power, emperors, soldiers and dictators. They include such self-explanatory pieces as <em>Pride of&nbsp;the Gatekeeper</em> from 1929 and the evil-looking <a href=\"http://nicolecarrel.net/Sea_Snail_King.html\" title=\"\"><em>Sea Snail King</em></a> from 1933. Satire stretches into beautiful design in&nbsp;the 1930 <em>Conqueror</em>. A small, geometrical figure, alone and running, bears a flag clearly too heavy for him to&nbsp;support. He seems to be running in one direction; a spear or a&nbsp;giant arrow, perhaps, is pointing in quite the other direction. He is going to&nbsp;fall over. Or,&nbsp;still more abstract, later in&nbsp;the 1930s, when the terror of the dictators had become completely clear,&nbsp;he painted the great 1939 <a href=\"http://www.picturebook-illust.com/artist/003_klee/106.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Destroyed Labyrinth</em></a>. Klee had long been drawn to&nbsp;fragments, half-signifying a lost civilisation; there are many images associated with Egyptian themes from earlier in his career. In&nbsp;<em>Destroyed Labyrinth</em> we see the remains of a&nbsp;tyrant; the walls were built to herd and harry and control people. Now they are&nbsp;in fragments; the builder's purpose is&nbsp;lost; across these small fragments, a&nbsp;child could find his way. Like all of&nbsp;Klee's later work, it is, on some level,&nbsp;a beautiful and noble statement against the tyrannies of his time. Like all of Klee's work, it does not itself dictate or control; it allows the eye to&nbsp;find its own&nbsp;way through its patterns&nbsp;and structures.</p><p>He is the artist I love best in the world: I love his modesty and his resourcefulness, and his willingness to combat oppression and violence with laughter. His work reflects the idea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/milankundera\" title=\"\"><em>Milan Kundera</em></a>, that the machinery of power works by imposing forgetfulness; that the way the individual can fight back is through laughter. At the time, nothing could have seemed more fragile and pointless a gesture against the armies of Hitler than a painting of&nbsp;fish, gawping at each other, by a&nbsp;Dessau art professor. But nothing remains of Hitler's power, and the structures he built are mostly dust. What certainly does remain are is a&nbsp;little, tender picture of a garden; a&nbsp;sheet of luminous colours; music transformed into an image.</p><p>Klee died in great pain in 1940, waiting for the Swiss state to acknowledge that he was a citizen of the country in which he was born. It&nbsp;must have seemed to him that he had died in failure, in a&nbsp;world that he could do nothing about. As the exhibition of his incomparable, funny, inexhaustible work opens at Tate Modern, we can say that here is an artist who got more right than most.</p><p>• Philip Hensher's novel about Klee at the Bauhaus, <em>The&nbsp;Emperor Waltz</em>, will be published next year.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418849461|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|c355c7fecf24a6ac56274714a4a4e85d54ef2380 -->",

        "headline":"New York museum ups security as gold bar sculpture goes on show",
        "body":"<p>Every art museum needs guards. But at the <a href=\"http://www.newmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">New Museum in New York</a>, a work by the artist Chris Burden requires security of an especially intense variety.</p><p><a href=\"http://referentiel.nouvelobs.com/file/1215685.jpg\" title=\"\">Tower of Power</a>, a 1985 sculpture now on show in the long-awaited Burden retrospective, consists of 100 kilograms of gold ingots – worth, at today's prices, about £2.6m – stacked in a small pyramid and encased in a vitrine. Surrounding the gold are tiny figures made of matchsticks and sewing needles, encircling the tower like worshippers. The pyramid is barely a foot tall, and it's placed on a modest pedestal that puts the gold below eye level.</p><p>The curators have installed Tower of Power in one of the museum's least visible locations: a tiny niche on a stairwell between the third and fourth floors. Visitors are only allowed up one at a time and must deposit their coats and bags in a locker beforehand. At a press preview this week, an affable private guard – wearing not a New Museum uniform but a dark blue polo shirt with the word \"SECURITY\" emblazoned on it – stood watch. The New Museum will station someone there 24 hours a day.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/chris-burden-extreme-measures\" title=\"\">Chris Burden: Extreme Measures</a>, which opens to the public this weekend, is the first major exhibition of the transgressive Los Angeles artist in the United States in 25 years. The show takes up the entirety of the New Museum's building and has posed logistical challenges even beyond the defense of 100 kilos of bullion.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.boweryboogie.com/2013/09/new-museum-unveils-chris-burden-ghost-ship-facade/\" title=\"\">Dangling on the facade of the museum is Ghost Ship (2005)</a>, a 30ft schooner originally designed to sail unmanned, guided by a computer program. The vessel will remain in place for a year. Also disrupting the exterior is a new work: <a href=\"http://newmuseum.tumblr.com/post/62900262358/opening-today-chris-burden-extreme-measures\" title=\"\">a pair of 36ft towers affixed to the roof</a>. Their incomplete design suggests the breakneck construction of the New Museum's gentrifying neighbourhood and the Twin Towers that once stood just to the south. The structures were installed with a crane that reached from the street all the way to the top of the museum, and the title of the new work – Twin Quasi Legal Skyscrapers – hints at the challenges Burden's art has posed to the institution.</p><p>Elsewhere in the exhibition, viewers will encounter a 1964 Ford crane truck with a one-ton weight suspended from an apparatus mounted on the vehicle's flatbed. <a href=\"http://newmuseum.tumblr.com/post/61783002478/chris-burdens-1-ton-crane-truck-2009-is-now\" title=\"\">One Ton Crane Truck (2009)</a> is on the ground floor because curators were unable to transport it upstairs.</p><p>A giant kinetic sculpture, <a href=\"http://moca.org/pc/viewArtWork.php?id=4\" title=\"\">The Big Wheel (1979)</a>, is a three-ton, 8ft flywheel powered by a 1968 Benelli motorcycle. When a gallery assistant revs the motorcycle's engine, the flywheel starts spinning: at first slowly, then disconcertingly fast. According to the museum, the giant cast-iron flywheel can hit 200 revolutions a minute.</p><p>Burden first came to prominence in the 1970s with videotaped performances of uncommon bravery, or recklessness: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26R9KFdt5aY\" title=\"\">having a friend shoot him in the arm with a rifle</a> (Shoot, 1971), or <a href=\"http://www.zwirnerandwirth.com/exhibitions/2004/0904Burden/transfixed.html\" title=\"\">having himself crucified on the bonnet of a Volkswagen Beetle</a> (Trans-Fixed, 1974). The new retrospective features these works only through printed documentation, although, in a videotaped interview, the artist discusses the risks and relevance of his early performances. Asked whether Shoot was anything more than a foolhardy gesture, Burden counters, \"Being shot is as American as apple pie.\"</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419041256|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|106da72140748b92588b4fd2952f8794b672aef0 -->",

        "body":"<p>A replica of the Victorian-era Crystal Palace could be rebuilt on the same site as the original building in south London by 2018, according to plans unveiled by mayor Boris Johnson and a Chinese billionaire behind the proposed scheme.</p><p>Ni Zhaoxing, chairman of property development firm ZhongRong Group, is investing &pound;500m to rebuild what was the first large-scale glass and steel building. The structure, left, was designed by Joseph Paxton for the Great Exhibition of 1851 and erected in Hyde Park. It was relocated to Sydenham in 1854 but burned down in 1936.</p><p>Ni, who Forbes magazine estimates is worth $1.25bn (&pound;772m), said that he has visited the ruins of the old Crystal Palace at least 10 times in the past.</p><p>He said he was motivated by passion rather than greed: &quot;When I visited the ruins I thought how can we restore the former glory of the Crystal Palace?&quot;</p><p>Speaking a few feet away from the proposed site of the new building on the Italian-style terraces – its staircases and balustrades crumbling from neglect, the odd headless statue evoking the faded might of an imperial past – Johnson called the plan &quot;a brilliant, original and simple vision&quot;.</p><p>While details were scant, the new building was described as a &quot;culture-led exhibition space&quot; that will include a hotel and conference facilities, studios, galleries and other commercial units.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-418988480\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380815956468/Artists-impression-of-how-008.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\" s=\"\" impression=\"\" of=\"\" how=\"\" the=\"\" rebuilt=\"\" crystal=\"\" palace=\"\" would=\"\" look.'=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Artist's impression of how the rebuilt Crystal Palace would look. Photograph: In-Press Photography/PA</figcaption></figure><p>The area has a history of strong community opposition to building on the site of Paxton's exhibition hall. In 1997, plans for a multiplex of retail units, bars and restaurants provoked a long legal battle and an occupation by activists. Ultimately Bromley council was defeated. Some locals also view Ni's plan with scepticism. They say they have been left in the dark about the plans that would affect their neighbourhood.</p><p>A local resident, Jessica Cahill, came to the park armed with a banner that read &quot;Parks for People, not for profit&quot;. She said she has no idea what the plans entail as the launch was closed to the public.</p><p>&quot;I'm concerned about the loss of green space and commercial space being developed on parkland,&quot; she said.</p><p>The head of the Crystal Palace Park Community Stakeholder Group, which sits on the park's executive board, said he was surprised to hear of these plans through articles in the press two months ago.</p><p>&quot;This came from leftfield,&quot; said Martin Tempia. &quot;No one seems to know anything about the micro elements of this. That's a particular concern when you consider the speed at which they want to push this forward,&quot; he said.</p><figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-418988481\"><img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/3/1380816197112/Boris-Johnson-and-Ni-Zhao-008.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Ni Zhaoxing at the Crystal Palace launch event.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /><figcaption>Boris Johnson and Ni Zhaoxing at the Crystal Palace launch event.

        "body":"<p>Opulent eroticism curves and billows in <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/shunga.aspx\" title=\"\">this bold exhibition of <em>shunga </em>prints</a> made to entertain and arouse Japanese men and women between 1600 and 1900. Fantasy blossoms too: in a sensational picture by Hokusai, <a href=\"http://www.mardecortesbaja.com/HokusaiDreamFishermansWife.jpg\" title=\"\">two octopuses make love to a fisherman's wife</a>, their tentacles literally everywhere. Her face is ecstatic.</p><p>The curator of this delve into art's sensual history <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/27/joy-art-japan-sex-passion\" title=\"\">at the British Museum</a> insists that pleasure is mutual in shunga. Early modern Japan was no feminist paradise, and the show does stress the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/women_of_the_pleasure_quarters.aspx\" title=\"\">harsh realities of the sex industry</a>. But in shunga prints, which were looked at by men and women and treasured by married couples, everyone is having a good time. Lovers bask side by side in kimonos and you have to look a moment to see what they're up to under the brightly coloured folds. Or they twist into spectacular conjunctions that create wondrous patterns of white limbs and backs.</p><p>This art is sexy. It's intended to promote what it portrays. But it has very little in common with modern \"pornography\": it would be <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/images/respro_japan_624.jpg\" title=\"\">absurd to see these pictures as objectifying anyone</a>. Men and women alike are shown with a sensual imagination that is <a href=\"http://japan400.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Utamakura.web_.jpg\" title=\"\">disarmingly loving</a>. There's no violence or cruelty and above all, no sense of sin.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-418752813'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/1/1380634481826/Shunga-009.jpg' alt='Shunga' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Sexual bliss ... Nishikawa Sukenobu, Sexual dalliance between man and geisha, c. 1711-16. Photograph: Copyright of The Trustees of the British Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Shunga was the underground art of samurai Japan. While official culture praised Chinese Confucian values of strict morality, authority and hierarchy, shunga prints laugh at all that and turn the official worldview upside down. A travesty of an advice book for women mocks conventional tips to obey your in-laws and advocates sex as the way to a happy marriage. But beyond jokes and titillation, there is in fact <a href=\"http://www.phaidon.com/resource/420-1-keisai-eisen.jpg\" title=\"\">an ideal that blazes through these images</a>: peace and concord are born out of sexual bliss.</p><p>No wonder this art appealed to westerners like <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec_017.jpg\" title=\"\">Toulouse-Lautrec</a> and <a href=\"http://uploads2.wikipaintings.org/images/aubrey-beardsley/the-climax-1893.jpg\" title=\"\">Aubrey Beardsley</a>, one or two of whose shunga-influenced images are here. Its lush lines and fiery colours are truly the door to alternative wisdom.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/418740777|2013-10-07T10:05:57Z|b8114afcf8ce87cdfd99700b6101365444199e3a -->",

Japanese technology company, <a href=\"http://www.yaskawa.com/global_home.html\">Yaskawa Electric</a> – known for its <a href=\"http://www.motoman.co.uk/\">Motoman</a> robotics used in the car industry – has turned its hand to human prosthetic enhancements and unveiled plans for what it calls the Ankle Walking Assist Device.</p> <p>The design is a motorised leg brace, fitted around the wearer's foot and shin with velcro straps, and connected by a cable to a waist-mounted battery pack. The boot senses when the user's heel makes contact with the ground and supplies a powered boost to help keep up a consistent walking pace. The amount of power the boots provide can be adjusted to help the user maintain balance and forward momentum – although budding Tony Starks will be sad to learn a turbo setting will not be available.</p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVJ7NvCGZOU\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MVJ7NvCGZOU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <p>Developed in partnership with the Tokyo-based <a href=\"http://global.shibaura-it.ac.jp/en/\">Shibaura Institute of Technology</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spacebio-lab.com/ENG-access.html\">Hiroshima University’s Space Bio Laboratories</a>, the robo-boot has been designed with stroke victims in mind, of which Japan has around 300,000 annually, though the company says it could aid a wide range of mobility impairments when it is released in 2015.</p> <p>Facing a rapidly ageing populace and a declining birth rate, Japan is increasingly examining the potential of assistive robotics to help its elderly population remain mobile for longer. The world's first neuroprosthetic robot suit – the <a href=\"http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/02/28/business/robot-suit-certified-for-disabled/#.Uk3h7GR4ZoU\">Hybrid Assistive Limb</a> produced by <a href=\"http://www.cyberdyne.jp/english/\">Cyberdyne</a> – was certified earlier this year, while the same technology is being used to develop automated muscular therapy techniques.</p> <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cd73eb3a-fdd1-4a2a-b950-a68648a01536\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/3/1380837207551/810f520f-a245-4fbe-a36b-3eb63143efce-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Iron Man … Cyberdyne's Hybrid Assistive Limb is controlled by the wearer's neural signals.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption>Iron Man … Cyberdyne's Hybrid Assistive Limb is controlled by the wearer's neural signals.

Wheeled to the side of a hospital bed, its leg-shaped jaws are clamped around the limbs of supine patients to administer a range of resistance exercises.
