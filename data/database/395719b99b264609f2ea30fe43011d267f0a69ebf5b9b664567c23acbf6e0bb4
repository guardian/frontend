        "trailText":"Paul Bettany shines in the starry cast of Margin Call, a tense, intelligent economic-thriller, writes <strong>Mark Kermode</strong>",
        "headline":"Mark Kermode's DVD round-up",
        "body":"<p>A couple of years ago, electrifying presence <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paul-bettany\" title=\"\">Paul Bettany</a> confessed that he had become so disillusioned with the romcoms and fantasy romps that were his bread and butter (handsomely paying the bills without feeding his soul) that he considered withdrawing from the cinema altogether. This would have been a great loss because Bettany (who acted Russell Crowe off the screen in both <em>A Beautiful Mind</em> and <em>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</em>) remains one of the UK's most charismatic and reliably watchable screen exports, a Malcolm McDowell for the 21st century. Thankfully the actor's faith in the medium was restored by a script that would go on to garner an unexpected but thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination for writer/director JC Chandor, forming the backbone of a film that would prove conclusively that Bettany still had within him the fire so spectacularly evidenced in films such as <em>Gangster No 1</em> and <em>Dogville</em>.</p><p>In the ensemble drama <strong>Margin Call</strong> (2011, Paramount, 15) Bettany plays a smoothly reptilian corporate bagman working in a pre-crash American financial firm in 2008. Having fired the risk analyst (Stanley Tucci) who stumbled on a potentially catastrophic \"over-exposure\", the firm faces a Lehman-like long, dark night of the soulin which the abyss looms as black as the sky above the glittering skyscrapers of New York. As the quizzically eyebrowed Zachary Quinto (one of several credited producers) struggles to understand the numbers, the crisis escalates upwards, through <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/kevinspacey\" title=\"\">Kevin Spacey</a>'s bullish boss to Jeremy Irons's peculiarly detached company overlord, who has the manner of a descended demi-god and demands to be spoken to \"as you might to a young child, or a golden retriever\".</p><p>With echoes of the fiscal morality of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89165/wall.street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street</em></a> and (more pertinently) the pressure-cooker grind of <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, it's easy to see why this tense, intelligent economic-thriller should have attracted such a starry cast (even Demi Moore makes a cameo). It's a little stagey at times but for the most part debut director Chandor injects real dramatic zing into the proceedings, surrounding his cast with alienating shiny surfaces that reflect the emptiness of their lives and the terror on their faces as Armageddon approaches. At its best, this has something of the madness of Po Bronson's scorchingly prophetic novel <em>Bombardiers</em>, with its only semi-satirical visions of traders hiding in crawlspaces beneath their desks serving as a perfect metaphor for offices as warzones. And in the midst of it all, Bettany gets to deliver the very best Gekko-esque speech about how \"normal people\" have nothing but their own unrealistic greed to blame for the coming storm, and how without him \"the world gets really fucking fair, really fucking quickly, and nobody actually wants that\". Largely overlooked in cinemas, this movie actually gains dramatic collateral on the small screen, where it proves a solidly smart investment.</p><p>Although JC Chandor and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/davidcronenberg\" title=\"\">David Cronenberg</a> are worlds apart as directors, there are clear thematic and stylistic comparisons to be made between <em>Margin Call</em> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cosmopolis-DVD-Robert-Pattinson/dp/B008HDQPVK/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352291642&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Cosmopolis</strong></a> (2012, Entertainment One, 15), the latter of  which is adapted (perhaps over-literally) from Don DeLillo's novel. Released in the same week that the final <em>Twilight</em> movie opens in cinemas, <em>Cosmopolis</em> knowingly casts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/robert-pattinson\" title=\"\">Robert Pattinson</a> as an utterly unsympathetic vampire – a monetary bloodsucker existing in a netherworld of crumbling numbers, crawling across New York in his spaceship-like limousine, hermetically sealed from the street-level chaos raging just beyond his tinted, bulletproof windows. Treating his subject as a quasi-sci-fi text in which currency is the new flesh, Cronenberg conjures a world in which \"money is talking to itself\" and people have been cut out of the equation. Unsurprisingly, there's much to admire but very little to like about this clinically cool depiction of an all-but-undead world in which the central characters struggle to imitate the behaviour of human beings.</p><p>Pattinson is great in the central role, Peter Suschitzky's camera staying with him for almost the entire running time, leaving him to shoulder the not inconsiderable burden of the movie's deep-seated malaise. High-brow supporting cameos (Juliette Binoche, Samantha Morton, Paul Giamatti) come and go but it's the under-appreciated Pattinson who provides the real engine power and who earns the right to be taken a lot more seriously than some give him credit for. The fact that a film with a star this big has managed to find such a (comparatively) small audience perversely proves its artistic integrity. I still don't actually like it, though.</p><p>Which brings us rather neatly to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Friends-Kids-DVD-Jon-Hamm/dp/B008LU8OCM/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352291703&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Friends with Kids</strong></a> (2011, Lionsgate, 15), a movie that it is possible to like (up to a point) without admiring in the slightest. Corralling the on-screen firepower from the infinitely more accomplished <em>Bridesmaids</em> (Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Chris O'Dowd and actor/producer Jon Hamm), this posits two BFF's making a pact to conceive and raise a child together while still staying the free-spirited independent individuals they were in pre-parental life. The fact that any of this raises a chuckle, let alone a laugh, should be seen as high praise considering how grizzly the mutant prospect of <em>When Harry Met Sally…</em> meets <em>What to Expect When You're Expecting</em> looks on paper. The problem, as director/writer/star <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/03/jennifer-westfeldt-friends-kids-hamm-interview\" title=\"\">Jennifer Westfeldt</a> discovers, is that a good heart and an even better cast don't necessarily make for a great comedy, although only the most hard-hearted viewer would make it through without raising a smile.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/398964094|2014-05-14T16:53:45Z|04cb2e711293f49d834b17d60f9c324e39b5ec3c -->",
