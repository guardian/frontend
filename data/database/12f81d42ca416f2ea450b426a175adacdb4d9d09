        "headline":"Christina Aguilera feeds 'war-torn' Rwanda",
        "body":"<p>Christina Aguilera, ambassador for World Food Program, recently went to \"war-torn Rwanda\"<a title=\"People Magazine tells us\" href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20738743,00.html\"><em> People Magazine</em> tells us</a><a title=\"People Magazine tells us\" href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20738743,00.html\">.</a> Well, thankfully she made it back home safely. War is not an easy thing. Although, I'm not sure exactly which war <em>People Magazine</em> is referring to â€“ last I checked, the civil war and genocide in Rwanda <a title=\"ended 20 years ago\" href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7027.pdf\">ended 20 years ago</a>. Well, Rwanda <a href=\"http://africasacountry.com/jeffrey-gettlemans-profile-of-paul-kagame-the-global-elites-favorite-strongman/\">has other problems</a> and its government is implicated in violence in neighbouring DRC, but it is not war-torn. </p><p>Her <a title=\"Light Up The Sky\" href=\"http://www.maxilyrics.com/christina-aguilera-light-up-the-sky-lyrics-a752.html\">Light Up The Sky</a> forms the background to the video about Aguilera's trip. We hear her sing \"When skies are grey, I'll light your way, I'll be your shoulder, You can lean on me\" while seeing her feed \"starved African children\".</p><p>\"The people of Rwanda touched me in a way I cannot express or put into words. They are in a place that needs our help and I am so proud of the work that we are doing there,\" Aguilera says. \"This trip came at a time when I needed to step away and connect with bigger issues in the world,\" she continues.</p><p>Africa. Helping westerners who're a wee bit down-in-the-dumps feel better about themselves since 1884.</p><p>Even if we were to accept this blatant lie that Rwanda is a \"war-torn\" place where \"refugee camps\" abound, what kind of superpowers do Aguilera and the WPF have to make them think they alone could change such situation? War and poverty are the result of larger structural inequalities, part of larger historical, political circumstances that no individual can resolve. And certainly not Hollywood style celebrities: Aguilera, Invisible Children's <a title=\"Jason Russell\" href=\"http://africasacountry.com/?s=jason+russell\">Jason Russell</a> or even <a title=\"Bono\" href=\"http://africasacountry.com/?s=bono\">Bono</a>. Enough of these celebrities scrolling out of nowhere wanting to save African lives. Keep to your various professions thank you very much.</p><p>Also, the participating \"restaurants\" to help end world hunger, partners with the WFP, are KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Really? Junk food providers helping end world hunger. Given all the information available to indicate the disastrous effects (heart diseases, diabetes) of eating junk food this partnership couldn't be more ironic.</p><p>The video ends with Aguilera singing \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" to a group of children. One among them is singing along and she seems a bit surprised by this. Too unfathomable that children of \"war-torn poor Rwanda\" might know an English/American nursery rhyme? Welcome to the 21st century.</p><p><em>Natacha Nsabimana is a Phd candidate in anthropology at Columbia University in New York</em></p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419855312|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|2addbb34340075cc6b2954c1a35883a67ef63328 -->",
