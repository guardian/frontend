        "body":"<p>The devil is making a comeback. </p><p>Or maybe, if we're to believe a certain group of politicos, he's been hiding in plain sight all along. </p><p>First, we had Representative Michele Bachmann (Republican, Minneosota) asserting that President Obama's decision to help a segment of the Syrian rebels is proof positive that the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/michele-bachmann-end-times_n_4060063.html\">four horsemen of the apocalypse would be showing up any day now</a>. Because terrorists.</p><p>\"Rather than seeing this as a negative, we need to rejoice, Maranatha, come Lord Jesus, His day is at hand,\" she said in an interview with a Christian radio station. </p><p>Senator Rand Paul (Republican, Kentucky), speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.valuesvotersummit.org/\">Values Voter Summit</a> over the weekend, declared that there was a \"worldwide war against Christianity\" – and the president, he said, isn't doing a thing to stop it. And then we had Senator <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/14/politics/shutdown-showdown/\">Ted \"Shutdown\" Cruz</a> (Republican, Texas), at the same conference, using a line from the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/\">The Usual Suspects</a> – \"the greatest trick the devil ever played was to convince the world he didn't exist\" – to make a clumsy analogy to liberals.</p><p>Because leftwingers have \"convinced conservatives that we cannot win\". Never mind those <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/10/20903624-nbcwsj-poll-shutdown-debate-damages-gop?lite\">plummeting Republican approval ratings</a>, senator, Satan made the pollsters do it.</p><p>Sadly, I've come to expect such \"us v them\" histrionics from Bachmann et al. They are, after all, playing to their base. So I'd be tempted to dismiss this all as political theater – played-out political theater – if it weren't for <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/\">that crazy times interview</a> that US supreme court Justice Antonin Scalia did with New York magazine. In it, he talked about the devil. At great length. With no apparent irony:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>And then You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people and whatnot. And that doesn't happen very much anymore … It's because he's smart … What he's doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He's much more successful that way.</p></blockquote><p>And then, he told the reporter that since she didn't hold the same belief system, she'd be going to hell, too. Let's hope he was kidding about that. </p><p>Now, I'm all about freedom of religion. (My own beliefs tend to veer towards agnosticism, with a healthy side of Buddhism.) And I certainly respect the good justice's right to believe in whatever the hell he wants to believe in, even if that means a fervent belief in Beelzebub. But given that Scalia's about to weigh in on a case about <a href=\"http://www.citizenlink.com/2013/10/08/u-s-supreme-court-to-hear-new-york-prayer-case-next-month/\">public prayer in government meetings</a>, I really wish he'd kept his lips zipped.</p><p>Religion has no place in politics – and it certainly has no place in the US supreme court. Religion, or the lack thereof, is such a deeply, deeply personal thing. People who think they've got a personal pipeline to the divine make me nervous. Scratch that. People <em>in power</em> who think they've got a personal pipeline to the divine make me nervous.</p><p>Really nervous. Because religion has been used in this country to justify all sorts of things – slavery being at the top of that list. It encourages revisionist thinking, like the Texas Board of Education's reshaping American history in its <a href=\"http://billmoyers.com/content/messing-with-texas-textbooks/\">textbooks</a>. And unless you've pulled some mystical magic trick, died, crossed over to the great beyond and come back again, how do you really <em>know</em> what God's thinking? If, that is, She exists at all. </p><p>So, I don't like the role that religion – to be specific, Christianity – plays too often in American politics. It made me cringe during the 2008 presidential election, watching Barack Obama tie himself into knots trying to establish his Christian bonafides. Why should it matter? What if he were, let's say, a devout adherent to the <a href=\"http://www.bahai.us/\">Baha'i faith</a>? Or if he were a committed atheist?</p><p>No, we weren't created to be a Christian nation, even though the Founding Fathers had Christians in their ranks. When he was president, Thomas Jefferson, a fervent theist, told a group of Baptist ministers government had no business meddling in religion. Moreover, he said, there needed to be a <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/jeffwall.html\">\"wall of separation between church and state\"</a>.</p><p>What happened to the wall? I like the wall. We need the wall. In fact, let's toss a few more bricks on top of the wall while we're at it – the better to keep the devil from meddling in our political affairs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419941161|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|0531399467b317e032c3304c90b4625182c7c5ee -->",

        "body":"<p>From the moment Pope Francis <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9928534/First-sight-of-Pope-Francis.html\">stepped out on that balcony</a>, I knew that something was different. Maybe it was the shy smile, the warm wave. The choice of \"Francis\" perhaps. Or his Jesuit roots, his Argentinian homeland. But still, I was waiting for the Prada loafer to drop.</p><p>I was waiting for Francis to bash gay and lesbian people and advocate against our equality. And then he said<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/29/pope-francis-says-wont-judge-gay-priests/\"> not to judge us</a>. I was waiting for him to wash over the sex abuse scandals as if they never happened. And then he authorized new laws for the Vatican City State that<a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/belief/pope-francis-bank-scandal-clergy-abuse-united-nations\"> criminalize sexual abuse of children</a>.</p><p>I was waiting for him to be silent on issues that matter to me, issues of worker justice and human rights. And then he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/31/pope-francis-easter-address-greed\">spoke out against corporate greed </a>and called for a <a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2013/09/07/pope-francis-leads-global-prayer-vigil-for-syria/\">day of prayer for the people of Syria</a>.</p><p>This isn't to say that he's been perfect. We're still trying to help him find the key to that door Pope John Paul II shut on women's ordination. But he's got many progressive Catholics enthusiastic about our church again.</p><p>Yesterday, when @pontifex was showing up on my Twitter feed at a rather alarming rate, I expected the worst. Decades of secrecy and scandal from popes and bishops alike taught me that, when it comes to the church hierarchy, the worst can too often be expected.</p><p>But Francis, as he's done since the white smoke rose, confounded my expectations. His words from a<a href=\"http://americamagazine.org/pope-interview\"> lengthy interview in the latest issue of America,</a> a Catholic weekly, rang more like poetry than prose to my progressive Catholic ears.</p><p>The church should be a \"home for all\" and not a \"small chapel\" limited to a chosen few? Yes.</p><p>\"I have never been a right-winger\"? Me neither.</p><p>\"I believe consultation is very important\"? Call me anytime.</p><p>The church is \"the people of God, pastors and people together\"? Amen.</p><p>All I could think was, \"This guy gets it\". He gets what Catholics have been saying for years. He gets that Catholics don't want our hierarchy to have limited views that don't reflect our own. He gets why so many Catholics have been searching for the nearest exit. He gets that things need to change.</p><p>I wish that I could just bask in the knowledge that the pope and the people in the pews share many of my views for a transformed church. But I can't. American Catholic that I am, I've got the bishops to consider.</p><p>Since Francis' election, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops hasn't seemed to reverse course. The bishops are still advocating against the rights of LGBT people with both money and voice. They are still undermining women's access to reproductive healthcare. They are still hard on nuns. They are still maintaining the very small chapel they've carved out over the years.</p><p>Perhaps the bishops can't go cold turkey and they need to wean themselves off their \"<a href=\"http://americamagazine.org/pope-interview\">obsession</a>\" – Francis' word – with abortion and gay and transgender people. I'd suggest silence as a good option. Or a stop payment on their checks to anti-gay, anti-women organizations. Or both.</p><p>If this were a game of chess, it'd be the bishops' move. I hope they choose to \"find new balance\" with me and my friend Francis. If not, I too fear that the church we love could crumble like a \"house of cards\".</p><p>Pope Francis is different. He isn't willing to settle for mediocrity or myopia, and that alone is refreshing. What we need now is quick and decisive action – or inaction, as the case may be – by the pope and the US bishops that reflect these transformational words. Until that happens, I'll still be waiting.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/417858860|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|0f280ae98293094419162f1e1a7beba54f24c2e6 -->",

        "headline":"What can religion offer politics?",
        "body":"<p>It wasn't so long ago that the decline of religion and the inevitable onward march of secularism were being taken for granted. To some people, the world might still seem like that as not even the worst <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globalrecession\" title=\"Guardian: Global recession\">global economic crisis</a> since the Depression appears to have done very much to dampen the public appetite for consumerism, celebrity culture and other materialistic pursuits. These enticements may be on hold for the moment for most of us, but we can still enjoy them vicariously as we watch the rich doing the business on our behalf, manfully shouldering the burden of ensuring that the profits of designer shops are booming once again.</p><p>But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iran\" title=\"Guardian: Iran\">events in Iran</a> are a stark reminder of the glowering presence of religion on the world stage, not just in the form of al-Qaida-style fanaticism. There, it is a governing force that demands legitimisation through the ballot box, and won't take no for an answer. The regime may be facing its toughest challenge since it took power, but it's clear that Islam is still an overarching form of ordering society preferred by millions of people. Elsewhere, various forms of Christianity are surging. <a href=\"http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10797\" title=\"Prospect: The global war for souls\">Dr Eric Kaufman writes</a> that \"Middle class Chinese are flocking to Christianity\". In Korea, adherents of Protestantism grew from little more than 2% of the population in 1950 to 20% today. \"Throughout the developing world, in fact, the 'hotter,' more emotional forms of Christianity are enjoying a resurgence, with Pentecostalism in the lead\", Dr Kaufman writes. \"An eighth of Brazil and 20% of Guatemala is now theirs.\"</p><p>There are many countries whose governments see religious resurgence posing a serious challenge to the future shape of their societies. Quite a few of those are in Europe. Only a few days ago, Nicolas Sarkozy <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6557252.ece\" title=\"Times: Burka makes women prisoners, says President Sarkozy\">made a forceful statement</a> about Muslim women wearing full body covering in the form of the burka or niqab, which he said is not welcome in France: \"It is a sign of subservience, a sign of debasement.\" To Sarkozy it is an attack on French republican values. Such a response plays on fears that fundamentalist religion exploits the tolerance which prevails in liberal democratic societies. Once firmly established, it then demands more and more accommodation to its specific religious needs until it is in a position to subvert and alter the very liberalism that allowed it to gain a foothold in the first place.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.eurozine.com/articles/article_2009-06-19-haraszti-en.html\" title=\"Miklós Haraszti\">Miklós Haraszti</a> gives an example of this on the international stage: \"On 26 March, the UN human rights council passed a resolution condemning 'defamation of religions' as a human rights violation, despite wide concerns that it could be used to justify curbs on free speech. The council adopted the non-binding text, proposed by Pakistan on behalf of the Islamic states, with a vote of 23 states in favour and 11 against, with 13 abstentions.\" Haraszti says this is \"a measure which cements oppressive governments' control of free speech while still sounding compatible with the advanced multiculturalism of liberal democracies\".</p><p>Whether Sarkozy's rather aggressive approach is the right way to ensure that religion knows its place in politics and society remains to be seen. Certainly, the world has changed so much that it's not enough to rely on tacit understandings to constitute an framework in which newly assertive religious groups can argue for their principles. It's also not enough to assume that a clear-cut separation of church and state or an equally clear-cut state religion can do the job either. I'm not saying that existing arrangements can't work, but that the new circumstances make a public debate about this issue imperative – in the UK as much as anywhere.</p><p>By new circumstances I mean, for example: First, the end of the cold war left the world without an overarching narrative of good and evil and created a free market in ideas in which any group that is sufficiently assertive and has access to media can communicate its prescriptions for the common good. Those who have taken full advantage of this are religious groups, especially evangelical and fundamentalist ones. This trend will not go away. Second, however advanced the society, the multiple crises of recent years have shown that rational, secular ideologies don't have all the answers to social and political problems. Can it be right to prevent certain religious groups, however doubtful their democratic credentials, from being heard on such problems? Third, the growing tendency of fundamentalist groups playing a more assertive role in society is not a passing phenomenon because they have mastered the technology and modes of communication of modernity. Fourth, in some countries, where the state is unable or unwilling to provide an adequate social safety net, they are a vital source of social welfare support for millions of impoverished people.</p><p>However, it would be wrong to think that the religious challenge comes only from out-and-out fundamentalists. For example, I happen to believe that the Human Rights Act has become a crucial means of ensuring that common universal values can override the unjust practices of certain identity groups. But Britain's human rights culture has come under attack in the UK from both Christian and Jewish sources. <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofyork.org/1841\" title=\"John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, said\">John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, said</a> in 2008: \"Human rights without the safeguarding of a God-reference tends to set up rights which trump others' rights when the mood music changes.\" In The Dignity of Difference, Chief Rabbi Sir Jonathan Sacks made a similar point when he wrote that the universal code of human rights \"understates the difficulty and necessity of making space for strangers – the very thing that has been the source of racism and exclusion in almost every society known to history\". The implication that values derived from religion would better protect the weak and the racially persecuted is not borne out by history. But whoever is right on this point, here we have two very influential, apparently mainstream religious voices determinedly arguing for a greater role for religion in politics.</p><p>Britain is not going the way of Iran, but the question of how we manage the role of religion in the public sphere needs substantive, open and urgent attention. I think a good starting point is the view of the <a href=\"http://www.continental-philosophy.org/2006/07/29/habermas-religion-in-the-public-sphere/\" title=\"Continental Philosophy: Habermas on religion in the public sphere\">German sociologist Jürgen Habermas</a>, who has convincingly argued that it is not the secular state's job to purge the public sphere of all religious contributions. On the contrary, it must make it possible for people of faith, who make no distinction between religious and political convictions, \"to take part in political will formation\". If the state tries to exclude such voices from the public sphere, it may be \"cutting society off from scarce resources for the generation of meanings and the shaping of identities.\" But what the state must do is act as a filter through which any religiously inspired proposals for shaping the common good are translated into secular language if they are to influence the policy agendas of the state.</p><p>I think this would help us avoid an approach based on a false view of Islam as a monolithic, hegemonic entity wherever it exists, and provide a level playing field for all religious groups who wish to contribute to policy debates about creating a good society.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/349393445|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|7d38e3f73875b91441384f12d157c56955a92acb -->",

        "body":"<p>The devil is making a comeback. </p><p>Or maybe, if we're to believe a certain group of politicos, he's been hiding in plain sight all along. </p><p>First, we had Representative Michele Bachmann (Republican, Minneosota) asserting that President Obama's decision to help a segment of the Syrian rebels is proof positive that the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/michele-bachmann-end-times_n_4060063.html\">four horsemen of the apocalypse would be showing up any day now</a>. Because terrorists.</p><p>\"Rather than seeing this as a negative, we need to rejoice, Maranatha, come Lord Jesus, His day is at hand,\" she said in an interview with a Christian radio station. </p><p>Senator Rand Paul (Republican, Kentucky), speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.valuesvotersummit.org/\">Values Voter Summit</a> over the weekend, declared that there was a \"worldwide war against Christianity\" – and the president, he said, isn't doing a thing to stop it. And then we had Senator <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/14/politics/shutdown-showdown/\">Ted \"Shutdown\" Cruz</a> (Republican, Texas), at the same conference, using a line from the movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/\">The Usual Suspects</a> – \"the greatest trick the devil ever played was to convince the world he didn't exist\" – to make a clumsy analogy to liberals.</p><p>Because leftwingers have \"convinced conservatives that we cannot win\". Never mind those <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/10/20903624-nbcwsj-poll-shutdown-debate-damages-gop?lite\">plummeting Republican approval ratings</a>, senator, Satan made the pollsters do it.</p><p>Sadly, I've come to expect such \"us v them\" histrionics from Bachmann et al. They are, after all, playing to their base. So I'd be tempted to dismiss this all as political theater – played-out political theater – if it weren't for <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/\">that crazy times interview</a> that US supreme court Justice Antonin Scalia did with New York magazine. In it, he talked about the devil. At great length. With no apparent irony:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>And then You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people and whatnot. And that doesn't happen very much anymore … It's because he's smart … What he's doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He's much more successful that way.</p></blockquote><p>And then, he told the reporter that since she didn't hold the same belief system, she'd be going to hell, too. Let's hope he was kidding about that. </p><p>Now, I'm all about freedom of religion. (My own beliefs tend to veer towards agnosticism, with a healthy side of Buddhism.) And I certainly respect the good justice's right to believe in whatever the hell he wants to believe in, even if that means a fervent belief in Beelzebub. But given that Scalia's about to weigh in on a case about <a href=\"http://www.citizenlink.com/2013/10/08/u-s-supreme-court-to-hear-new-york-prayer-case-next-month/\">public prayer in government meetings</a>, I really wish he'd kept his lips zipped.</p><p>Religion has no place in politics – and it certainly has no place in the US supreme court. Religion, or the lack thereof, is such a deeply, deeply personal thing. People who think they've got a personal pipeline to the divine make me nervous. Scratch that. People <em>in power</em> who think they've got a personal pipeline to the divine make me nervous.</p><p>Really nervous. Because religion has been used in this country to justify all sorts of things – slavery being at the top of that list. It encourages revisionist thinking, like the Texas Board of Education's reshaping American history in its <a href=\"http://billmoyers.com/content/messing-with-texas-textbooks/\">textbooks</a>. And unless you've pulled some mystical magic trick, died, crossed over to the great beyond and come back again, how do you really <em>know</em> what God's thinking? If, that is, She exists at all. </p><p>So, I don't like the role that religion – to be specific, Christianity – plays too often in American politics. It made me cringe during the 2008 presidential election, watching Barack Obama tie himself into knots trying to establish his Christian bonafides. Why should it matter? What if he were, let's say, a devout adherent to the <a href=\"http://www.bahai.us/\">Baha'i faith</a>? Or if he were a committed atheist?</p><p>No, we weren't created to be a Christian nation, even though the Founding Fathers had Christians in their ranks. When he was president, Thomas Jefferson, a fervent theist, told a group of Baptist ministers government had no business meddling in religion. Moreover, he said, there needed to be a <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/jeffwall.html\">\"wall of separation between church and state\"</a>.</p><p>What happened to the wall? I like the wall. We need the wall. In fact, let's toss a few more bricks on top of the wall while we're at it – the better to keep the devil from meddling in our political affairs.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419941161|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|0531399467b317e032c3304c90b4625182c7c5ee -->",
