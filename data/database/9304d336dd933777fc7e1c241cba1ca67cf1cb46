        "body":"<p>I first met Abu Ali at the end of February 2012, both of us standing in an alleyway in Damascus, his car still running nearby. I was in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syria</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;civilian visa, and trying to hitch a lift to&nbsp;his home town Homs, 160km north of the capital. The Syrian army had by then been shelling rebel-held areas of Homs for three weeks and, like many, he was more focused on the humanitarian cost of conflict than its politics.</p><p>Abu Ali is part of what is commonly referred to as Syria's moderate opposition, though moderate is a relative term. He opposes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\" title=\"\">President Bashar al-Assad</a> but thinks that arming the revolt was a mistake; he will allow that people have a right to self-defence. He&nbsp;wasn't able to help me then (I found another way), but we have stayed in touch. This&nbsp;July, he&nbsp;told me that at least 1,600 of his personal contacts, friends and relatives had been killed or&nbsp;kidnapped in the past two and a half years. \"Our feelings have died,\" he said.</p><p>Late last month, we met again in Damascus. This time, I&nbsp;wanted to get to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs\" title=\"\">Homs</a> with him, to&nbsp;find out what life was now like in Syria's third city. Once home to a million people, in the early days of the conflict it was dubbed \"the capital of the Syria revolution\", but no one calls it that any more. Today, like much of the rest of the country, its citizens find themselves stuck in a vicious stalemate: regime forces move around the city, while many towns and villages in the surrounding countryside are in the hands of the rebels. Within&nbsp;Homs, the conflict has fired up long-dormant rivalries between Sunni Muslims (the overwhelming majority of Syrians) and the Alawite Muslim minority (many of whom are loyal to the ruling regime). Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/syria-chemical-weapons-destroyed\" title=\"\">UN inspectors began destroying Assad's chemical weapons</a>, but&nbsp;death by poison gas is not an over-arching concern for ordinary Syrians. Many more are being killed by simple bombs and bullets.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419774565'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381244335724/Abu-Ali--010.jpg' alt='Abu Ali ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Abu Ali at his home in an opposition area of Homs called Shammas; ­behind him is a bullet hole. Photograph: James Harkin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Abu Ali is a small man who treads carefully, head and shoulders bowed forward, like a pilgrim going quietly about his business. In Damascus, he leads me through the winding alleys of the city's Christian area, formulating an itinerary as we go. He has a peculiar gait; he suffers from slipped discs, the likely result of vigorous interrogation on an instrument called the German chair while serving a 12-year sentence in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sednaya_Prison\" title=\"\">Sednaya</a>, one of the country's most notorious prisons. He was jailed in the late 1980s for his involvement in a long-defunct underground communist organisation. On our way to lunch, we make a pit stop at the house of a young friend of his. The younger man lies face down on a bed and Abu Ali fits a chair into his back to demonstrate the technique; the hands and feet are tied to the seat, and the back adjusted to cause severe stress to the spine. Thirty-six of his prison colleagues are veterans of this procedure, he says, and all complain of the same problem.</p><p>Over a lunch of grilled meat and salad in a high-ceilinged restaurant popular with Christian supporters of the regime, we talk about Homs. (Not just Homs: during a lull in conversation, he&nbsp;points to a lavish salad and instructs me to \"eat that, good for sex\", and chuckles quietly.) Like everyone else, Abu Ali says, his two grown-up children are struggling for money: prices have risen three-fold in two years, and few people except government workers still have jobs. Before&nbsp;the conflict, he had work in the solar power industry but this has largely stalled; his&nbsp;solar contraptions come in useful only at&nbsp;home, during electricity blackouts.</p><p>He now spends much of his time helping some of the many hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the heavy shelling of rebel areas of&nbsp;Homs and the rest of the country. He manages a project for 600 families moved from rural Hama province and the city of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo\" title=\"\">Aleppo</a> to a village west of the city; this involves everything from fundraising to sourcing blankets. He bemoaned the price of milk and the lack of money spent on education; there is huge pressure on schools in the safer areas of the city, and too few schoolbooks. Then there is the strong risk of being hit by a stray mortar or bullet. On 28 May, his nephew Hamza, a 20-year-old student at the city's Ba'ath University, was out shopping with his young fiancee in a pro-regime area when they were hit by rockets fired by rebels. Both were killed instantly.</p><p>Getting at the truth about the Syrian conflict is not easy. Journalist visas from the government are rare, and travel beyond a few square kilometres of central Damascus requires permission from the ministry of information and the accompaniment of a government minder. Western journalists are often limited to a choice between atmospheric street detail or doleful prison interviews with stressed jihadis; what's harder to capture is a range of Syrians speaking freely about what they want. (In rebel-held northern Syria, the rise in criminality and the presence of al-Qaida-like groups makes reporting even more difficult.) Abu&nbsp;Ali had no wish to get into trouble with the authorities, but if I got the OK from the ministry, he said, he'd host me in Homs. A few days later, with my visa running out (and without telling him I was coming), I simply got on a bus.</p><p>This is one of the best ways to get to know ordinary Syrians. With no choice but to talk, and no one official looking over their shoulder, many are happy to practise their English by speaking to the stranger on the adjoining seat. The drawback is that this is a perilous way to travel: one bus at the depot in Damascus has a bullet hole in every window. My seatmate on this bus is especially anxious. A boy of 17 from a village near Hama, 40km north of Homs, he is making his first unaccompanied trip home after enrolling at Damascus University. Three days earlier, his friend was injured by a stray sniper bullet on this same route; it might have been the rebels, but no&nbsp;one really knows. He points to the seat where his friend was hit; he says only pride prevents him from lying on the floor for the entire journey.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419774566'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381244587513/Homs-market-009.jpg' alt='Homs market' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A street market in Karm al-Shami, central Homs, last month. Photograph: James Harkin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, the boy is no fan of the regime. His&nbsp;uncle was arrested 18 months ago and hasn't been heard of since; the family suspect he is dead. The people in his village have come to hate the rebels, too, he says. \"People are so, so bored with them. They come and blow up checkpoints outside towns and run away, then militias arrive and steal everything we have. They would steal even this,\" he says, pointing to my plastic cup. A poor woman from a nearby village had her only cow stolen by pro-regime militias; when a group of locals asked them to give it back, they told her it had said bad things about the president. Hama, long associated with anti-regime activity, is now very quiet, he&nbsp;says; there are so many soldiers there that oppositionists have learned to keep their mouths shut. \"The revolutionaries now accuse Hama of betrayal,\" the boy says. He is circumspect about his political beliefs even among his new university friends, because many might support the regime. \"When I'm around them, I say I love the president, that the terrorists should be punished.\"</p><p>Homs has been described in the west as a city under siege. This, I discover when Abu Ali drives me around it, is no longer the whole story. There are still enclaves under armed rebel control, including parts of the old city, where about 3,000 people are cut off from food and electricity, and living in appalling conditions. Elsewhere, the city is returning to a kind of nervy normality. Abu Ali explains that Homs divides into three areas: the rebel enclaves; pro-regime strongholds, often with large communities of Alawites; and areas with pro-opposition sympathies, such as the one where he lives, which are also tentatively controlled by the regime. In both these areas, the government subsidises the price of bread, and fresh food is plentiful, but prices have risen steeply and no one has the money to buy much. Abu Ali says the rebels had been smuggling food and drink into some areas through underground tunnels, but these were discovered and exploded by regime forces. It seems likely that these rebel strongholds will eventually fall to the regime, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/01/syrian-rebels-retreat-baba-amr-homs\" title=\"\">Baba Amr </a>did before them – this is the area of Homs where journalists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/marie-colvin\" title=\"\">Marie Colvin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/remi-ochlik\" title=\"\">Rémi Ochlik</a> were killed in February 2012. On our trip around the city, we drive past Baba Amr; while a few people have returned, it remains a shattered ruin and a&nbsp;warning from the regime to the rebels.</p><p>We pass through a checkpoint run by pro-regime paramilitaries, known by the oppositionists as shabiha, or ghosts. At one point he dashes out of the car to collect something and returns triumphant, having just been handed some money from a passerby to give to his refugees.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419774567'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381244883869/Homs-site-of-three-deaths-009.jpg' alt='Homs site of three deaths' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The row of shops where French journalist Gilles Jacquier was killed; it is close to the site where Abu Ali’s nephew and his fiancee were killed by rebel rockets in May this year. Photograph: James Harkin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>We drop in on Amjad, a wiry fellow oppositionist who now considers both sides as bad as each other. \"When we watch CNN, France 24, even the BBC,\" he says, \"I don't think they are talking about Homs. It is lies.\" The regime certainly bombs buildings, he says, and it sometimes makes mistakes, but often it's because those buildings are being used as barracks by armed groups. \"We are lost between shabiha and debaha,\" he sighs, using the Arabic word for slaughterers to refer to the rise of puritanical, sectarian Islamism among the rebels. Amjad's brother, a 60-year-old taxi driver, was kidnapped on 4 May. There has been no demand for money or any other obvious motive; the family have not heard from him since.</p><p>Such kidnappings are rife. Some are for military reasons, Abu Ali says, others are motivated by money or religion; sometimes, it's all three. One of&nbsp;his former teachers, a rich artist and a&nbsp;very&nbsp;old man, was recently kidnapped by shabiha who want 24m Syrian pounds (about £100,000) for his release; he hopes to hear from the kidnappers in&nbsp;the next day or two. </p><p>Then there is Tariq, an Alawite recently kidnapped for largely sectarian reasons; armed rebels (what Abu Ali calls \"revolution shabiha\") are demanding the release of government&nbsp;detainees in exchange for his return.</p><p>On our way back to the car, Abu Ali points out the spot where his nephew and his fiancee were killed. Nearby is the row of shops where French journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/11/syria-homs-attack-convoy\" title=\"\">Gilles Jacquier </a>was killed in similar circumstances in January 2012. Jacquier's wife has written a book blaming the regime for the death, but Abu Ali, based on the geography and&nbsp;the pattern of attacks, dismisses this theory. He&nbsp;takes me to the abandoned tenement from&nbsp;which he believes the rocket was fired by&nbsp;anti-regime forces.</p><p>We head to an opposition area of the city, home almost exclusively to Sunni Muslims, for tea with some of Abu Ali's acquaintances. One is from the ruined Baba Amr district, and has twice been forced to leave his home when the army entered to rout the rebels. He won't talk to a journalist, he&nbsp;says, and sits clutching prayer beads. In any case, he adds, talking about it only makes him cry, and he has a problem with his corneas that means he can't let himself shed any tears. On the verge of crying, he changes the subject. Syrians are an optimistic people, he wants me to know, with 7,000 years of civilisation behind them; some of&nbsp;his best friends are Alawites and Christians, friendships born of coincidence, not religion. \"No&nbsp;one should have to see the things I've seen,\" is all he will say about Baba Amr. He stares out of&nbsp;the window like a blind man.</p><p>Abu Ali is of a generation for whom picking apart Syria's complex mosaic of religions and ethnicities remains a tasteless and unpatriotic business. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, he has never told me directly that he is&nbsp;an Alawite Muslim himself. This fact might make it easier for him to pass through some regime checkpoints, but it also poses certain risks. After&nbsp;our tour of the city, he drives me back to the home he shares with his wife in an opposition area called Shammas. It is on the sixth floor of a&nbsp;tenement block and only 800m from Baba Amr; like many homes in the area, there is a crack or crevice from a stray bullet in almost every room. Things aren't as bad as they were, he says, but sometimes he and his wife can't sleep for the noise of the mortars passing overhead and crashing into the ground.</p><p>Amjad, who used to live here, joins us for the ride. He, too, is an Alawite Muslim, and he moved from Shammas to Akrama because he was afraid that his daughters might attract insults in the street because of their religion: \"Just from young people, looking for revenge.\" Shammas, a&nbsp;formerly mixed neighbourhood, is slowly being drained of its Alawites; Abu Ali is one of the few who remains. \"He believes he is safe here,\" Amjad&nbsp;ribs him; it is clear he doesn't have the same confidence. For his part, Abu Ali says he has been stopped at several rebel checkpoints and never had any problems; then again, he is well known in&nbsp;the area, so his experience might not be representative. When he was ordered to leave by&nbsp;one armed group, another stepped in to guarantee his safety.</p><p>Beyond the bombs and the bullets, it is this creeping sectarian migration that represents the most ominous threat to Homs, and to Syria as a whole. Earlier that day, we discover, a Syrian army missile destroyed a building in a very densely populated area of the city, al-Waer, just a few kilometres away. Five hundred thousand people now live in al-Waer; half are recent arrivals, sent from other areas of the city as they have come under the control of armed rebels. Just about everyone there is a Sunni Muslim and the area is not fully under regime control. It is a no-go area even for Abu Ali. Conditions are poor; everyone has a home and bread to eat, but it is seriously overcrowded and some of the tenement blocks remain unfinished, without windows or doors. The regime relies on fortified military positions directly surrounding the area to keep an eye on&nbsp;residents, neutralising threats with rockets or&nbsp;snipers; it sounds like an open prison.</p><p>On a previous visit to Homs, I had met a young man who had been moved to al-Waer from a rebel enclave. We stayed in touch, and over the last few years his aspirations have shifted from getting a good job and a girlfriend to a growing sympathy with the extreme Islamism of the rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra. He's studying engineering at the city's Ba'ath University, but the checkpoints on the way there and back put the fear of God into him; the shabiha, he&nbsp;feels, can do what they like. A week before I&nbsp;travelled to Syria, and having refused all my previous offers to send a little cash, he had tentatively asked for money for his family: it struck me as a sign of growing desperation. \"Life is&nbsp;hard but we continue to live,\" he wrote. \"Here in Homs, all Sunni people want to leave to a safer place.\" He signed off: \"See you after victory.\"</p><p>In the evening, while his wife and I eat grapes and watch a popular Syrian crooner on television, Abu Ali sits in his pyjamas at his desk behind us, doing his accounts, catching up with friends on Facebook and Skype, making a few phone calls to&nbsp;try to find a lawyer for someone in prison. In passing, I see the figure of 120,000 he has written on a sheet of paper; this, it turns out, is someone's best guess at the number of people now being held in regime jails. I ask if there has been any news on his former teacher. The gang who kidnapped him have been persuaded to drop their ransom from 24m Syrian pounds to 3m, he says. Like most of&nbsp;the work Abu Ali does, it's progress of sorts, but still a long way from good news.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419383043|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|5928c478af5a2a11b3da597979dba534ea263f1c -->",

        "body":"<p>Syrian rebels killed at least 190 civilians and took more than 200 hostage during an offensive in Latakia province in August, Human Rights Watch said on Friday, in what it calls the first evidence of crimes against humanity by opposition forces.</p> <p>HRW said many of the dead had been executed by militant groups, some linked to al-Qaida, who overran army positions at dawn on 4 August and then moved into 10 villages nearby where members of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect lived.</p> <p>In its first government-sanctioned trip into Syria during the two-and-a-half year conflict, New York-based HRW has documented a series of sectarian mass killings by Assad's foes during a broader campaign in which Western-backed rebels took part.</p> <p>In some cases, entire families were executed or gunned down as they fled, according to the HRW report <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/10/10/you-can-still-see-their-blood\">You Can Still See Their Blood</a>.</p> <p>HRW identified five rebel groups instrumental to funding, organising, planning and carrying out the Latakia attacks, including the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant groups, as well as the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham and another unit of foreign jihadi fighters.</p> <p>These groups publicised their involvement through videos and statements, some of which were used to corroborate the HRW report. The operation appeared to have been largely financed by private Gulf-based donors, HRW said.</p> <p>What is less clear is the role of fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the armed wing of the main opposition coalition which is openly supported by the United States, Britain, France and Sunni Muslim Gulf states.</p> <p>In a video posted on 11 August and apparently filmed in Latakia, FSA chief Salim Idriss said the organisation was taking part in the offensive \"to a great extent\".</p> <p>But HRW researcher Lama Fakih, who spent several days in Latakia province in September and spoke to residents, soldiers, militiamen, doctors and officials, said she could not confirm whehter the FSA were present on the day the atrocities took place.</p> <p>Assad's forces are also accused by rights groups of committing atrocities and using incendiary and cluster bombs in populated areas. They have carried out sectarian attacks, including killing up to 450 civilians in two massacres in mainly Sunni Muslim areas in May, according to United Nations officials.</p> <p>The opposition and rights groups accuse Damascus of a chemical weapons strike in a Damascus suburb on 21 August that killed hundreds of civilians. The government blames the attack on rebels.</p> <p>Reuters was unable to get comment from all 20 rebel groups mentioned in the HRW report. Syrian National Coalition spokesman Khaled Saleh said the SNC condemned all human rights abuses and if any had been committed by rebels affiliated with the coalition, they would face justice.</p> <p>In a written statement to Reuters, Saleh said: \"We have previously committed ourselves to applying these rules on all the brigades that work for us and we will hold accountable, after investigation and fair trial, all those responsible for violations against human rights or international laws. The incidents in Latakia are not an exception and we will treat them as we treated previous cases.\"</p> <p>A member of the Sunni Islamist Ahrar al-Sham said its fighters had killed no civilians in the offensive.</p> <p>\"If someone uses a weapon against you, you have to fight them. If they do not, you must not kill them,\" said Abu Muhammed al-Husseini, the 30-year-old head of Ahrar al-Sham's political office in Raqqa.</p> <p>Lama Fakih, the Syria and Lebanon researcher in HRW's Middle East and North Africa division, told Reuters in reference to the Latakia operation by rebels: \"Homes were destroyed and burned. Most villagers had not returned.\"</p> <p>Fakih met Hassan Shebli, an Alawite man from the village of Barouda, who fled his village at 4.30am on 4 August as rebels approached. He left his wife, who was in her 60s and needed canes to walk, and his son, 23, who was paralysed, Fakih said.</p> <p>Shebli said they were both killed and buried behind his house. Fakih visited the house and saw bullet holes in the son's bed frame. \"I was able to see the blood splattered on the wall,\" she said, showing a picture of the room.</p> <p>Rebel footage posted on the internet showed images of Shebli's son and wife with rebel fighters during the operation.</p> <p>The scale and organisation of the attacks on civilians suggested premeditation and made them a crime against humanity, HRW said, rather than isolated war crimes reported during the Syrian civil war. The United Nations says the conflict has killed more than 100,000 people.</p> <p>\"These abuses were not the actions of rogue fighters,\" said Joe Stork, acting Middle East director at HRW. \"This operation was a co-ordinated, planned attack on the civilian population in these Alawite villages.\"</p> <p>Residents who returned to the villages said they found bodies of their neighbours on the streets and in their homes, as well as in piles of burnt corpses and in mass graves, Fakih said.</p> <p>Syria's mainly Sunni Muslim rebels are battling to overthrow Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam and accounts for about 12% of Syria's 23 million people.</p> <p>The Latakia offensive ended on 18 August, when the government regained control of the area. Rebels told Reuters in August that about 200 of Assad's men were killed at the start of the offensive.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419665001|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|81d56992d8ad744ed697c6fd010d9ff62059f162 -->",

Please post your comments below.</p> <p>Here's a roundup of the latest developments and analysis:</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/11/syrian-rebels-accused-killing-civilians-latakia\"><strong>Syrian rebels killed at least 190 civilians and took more than 200 hostage during an offensive in Latakia province in August, according to Human Rights Watch in what it says is the first evidence of crimes against humanity by opposition forces.</strong></a> It said&nbsp;many of the dead had been executed by militant groups, some linked to al-Qaida, who overran army positions at dawn on 4 August and then moved into 10 villages nearby where members of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect lived. The <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/10/10/you-can-still-see-their-blood\">report</a> said an arms embargo should be imposed on rebel groups found to have committed such atrocities.&nbsp;</p> <p>• <strong><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/10/10/uk-syria-crisis-children-idUKBRE9990UI20131010\">More than a million child refugees from Syria&nbsp;are vulnerable to exploitation including early marriage, domestic violence and child labour, according a warning from the UN's children's agency.</a>&nbsp;</strong>Michele Servadei, Unicef's deputy representative in Jordan, told a news briefing: &quot;In host communities they are much more exposed to child labour, to early marriage, to exploitation in general.&quot;</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46229&amp;Cr=syria&amp;Cr1=#.UlY8Chwf_O5\"><strong>The ambitious programme to destroy Syria's chemical weapons can only be achieved if both sides observe temporary ceasefires, according to the head of the international body overseeing the programme.</strong></a> Ahmet &Uuml;z&uuml;mc&uuml; director general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, told a news conference:&nbsp;“I think that the elimination of those weapons is in the interest of all. Therefore, if we can assure some cooperation by all parties and some temporary ceasefires could be established in order to permit our experts to work in a permissible environment… I think the targets could be reached.” The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/oct/11/nobel-peace-prize-2013-winner-announced-live-updates\">OPCW is the running for this year's Nobel Peace Prize</a>. </p> <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ELw4pU_jVg\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ELw4pU_jVg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/libyan-pm-kidnapping-zeidan\"><strong>Libya was thrown into turmoil on Thursday after the prime minister, Ali Zeidan, was kidnapped by more than 100 members of his own security force in retaliation for the arrest of an al-Qaida suspect by US special forces in Tripoli.</strong></a>&nbsp;The day's chaotic events deepened fears that Libya may be on the verge of disintegration, with security forces split between regular forces and many militia formations.</p> <h2>Egypt</h2> <p>• <a href=\"http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/83690/Egypt/Politics-/Cairo-condemns-Washington-for-suspending-military-.aspx\"><strong>Egypt has condemned a decision by the United States to suspend major arms deliveries and cut cash assistance to the Egyptian military, state-owned Ahram online reports.</strong> </a>&nbsp;Foreign ministry spokesman Badr Abdel Atty said:&nbsp;&quot;The decision was wrong in terms of content and time. It raises serious questions about US readiness to provide stable strategic support to Egyptian security progammes amid threats and terrorism challenges it has been facing.&quot;</p> <p>• <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/09/egypt\"><strong>The US decision is long-overdue as Egypt is &quot;heading towards fascism&quot; according to Guardian editorial.</strong></a> It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The country is being split into loyalists and traitors. Opponents are branded as non-Egyptians. In a <a href=\"http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/africa/7733-former-egyptian-mufti-supports-the-killing-of-protesters-\">video, </a>the former mufti of Egypt, Ali Gom'ah, said to an audience comprising General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and assembled police chiefs: &quot;Shoot [with live bullets] in full [power]. We must cleanse our city and our Egypt from these hooligans. They do not deserve our Egyptian [identity].&quot;</p> <p>Try as he might, General Sisi cannot contain the continued protest against his takeover. Egypt is locked down and its economy is haemorrhaging. The US, and the EU, must speak out, because the situation is untenable.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>•&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/iran-arrests-network-homosexual-satanists\"><strong>Iran's revolutionary guards have announced the arrest of &quot;a network of homosexuals and satanists&quot; in the western city of Kermanshah, prompting fresh alarm over the treatment of gay people in the Islamic republic.</strong></a>&nbsp;The group were picked up from one of the city's ceremony halls, which they had rented for a birthday party. The guards' website said they were dancing as the raid ensued.</p> </div> </div><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419673154|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|163f4034c87fbfd837e334b45c9ef341fa138721 -->",

        "body":"<p>I first met Abu Ali at the end of February 2012, both of us standing in an alleyway in Damascus, his car still running nearby. I was in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syria</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;civilian visa, and trying to hitch a lift to&nbsp;his home town Homs, 160km north of the capital. The Syrian army had by then been shelling rebel-held areas of Homs for three weeks and, like many, he was more focused on the humanitarian cost of conflict than its politics.</p><p>Abu Ali is part of what is commonly referred to as Syria's moderate opposition, though moderate is a relative term. He opposes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\" title=\"\">President Bashar al-Assad</a> but thinks that arming the revolt was a mistake; he will allow that people have a right to self-defence. He&nbsp;wasn't able to help me then (I found another way), but we have stayed in touch. This&nbsp;July, he&nbsp;told me that at least 1,600 of his personal contacts, friends and relatives had been killed or&nbsp;kidnapped in the past two and a half years. \"Our feelings have died,\" he said.</p><p>Late last month, we met again in Damascus. This time, I&nbsp;wanted to get to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs\" title=\"\">Homs</a> with him, to&nbsp;find out what life was now like in Syria's third city. Once home to a million people, in the early days of the conflict it was dubbed \"the capital of the Syria revolution\", but no one calls it that any more. Today, like much of the rest of the country, its citizens find themselves stuck in a vicious stalemate: regime forces move around the city, while many towns and villages in the surrounding countryside are in the hands of the rebels. Within&nbsp;Homs, the conflict has fired up long-dormant rivalries between Sunni Muslims (the overwhelming majority of Syrians) and the Alawite Muslim minority (many of whom are loyal to the ruling regime). Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/06/syria-chemical-weapons-destroyed\" title=\"\">UN inspectors began destroying Assad's chemical weapons</a>, but&nbsp;death by poison gas is not an over-arching concern for ordinary Syrians. Many more are being killed by simple bombs and bullets.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419774565'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381244335724/Abu-Ali--010.jpg' alt='Abu Ali ' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Abu Ali at his home in an opposition area of Homs called Shammas; ­behind him is a bullet hole. Photograph: James Harkin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Abu Ali is a small man who treads carefully, head and shoulders bowed forward, like a pilgrim going quietly about his business. In Damascus, he leads me through the winding alleys of the city's Christian area, formulating an itinerary as we go. He has a peculiar gait; he suffers from slipped discs, the likely result of vigorous interrogation on an instrument called the German chair while serving a 12-year sentence in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sednaya_Prison\" title=\"\">Sednaya</a>, one of the country's most notorious prisons. He was jailed in the late 1980s for his involvement in a long-defunct underground communist organisation. On our way to lunch, we make a pit stop at the house of a young friend of his. The younger man lies face down on a bed and Abu Ali fits a chair into his back to demonstrate the technique; the hands and feet are tied to the seat, and the back adjusted to cause severe stress to the spine. Thirty-six of his prison colleagues are veterans of this procedure, he says, and all complain of the same problem.</p><p>Over a lunch of grilled meat and salad in a high-ceilinged restaurant popular with Christian supporters of the regime, we talk about Homs. (Not just Homs: during a lull in conversation, he&nbsp;points to a lavish salad and instructs me to \"eat that, good for sex\", and chuckles quietly.) Like everyone else, Abu Ali says, his two grown-up children are struggling for money: prices have risen three-fold in two years, and few people except government workers still have jobs. Before&nbsp;the conflict, he had work in the solar power industry but this has largely stalled; his&nbsp;solar contraptions come in useful only at&nbsp;home, during electricity blackouts.</p><p>He now spends much of his time helping some of the many hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the heavy shelling of rebel areas of&nbsp;Homs and the rest of the country. He manages a project for 600 families moved from rural Hama province and the city of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo\" title=\"\">Aleppo</a> to a village west of the city; this involves everything from fundraising to sourcing blankets. He bemoaned the price of milk and the lack of money spent on education; there is huge pressure on schools in the safer areas of the city, and too few schoolbooks. Then there is the strong risk of being hit by a stray mortar or bullet. On 28 May, his nephew Hamza, a 20-year-old student at the city's Ba'ath University, was out shopping with his young fiancee in a pro-regime area when they were hit by rockets fired by rebels. Both were killed instantly.</p><p>Getting at the truth about the Syrian conflict is not easy. Journalist visas from the government are rare, and travel beyond a few square kilometres of central Damascus requires permission from the ministry of information and the accompaniment of a government minder. Western journalists are often limited to a choice between atmospheric street detail or doleful prison interviews with stressed jihadis; what's harder to capture is a range of Syrians speaking freely about what they want. (In rebel-held northern Syria, the rise in criminality and the presence of al-Qaida-like groups makes reporting even more difficult.) Abu&nbsp;Ali had no wish to get into trouble with the authorities, but if I got the OK from the ministry, he said, he'd host me in Homs. A few days later, with my visa running out (and without telling him I was coming), I simply got on a bus.</p><p>This is one of the best ways to get to know ordinary Syrians. With no choice but to talk, and no one official looking over their shoulder, many are happy to practise their English by speaking to the stranger on the adjoining seat. The drawback is that this is a perilous way to travel: one bus at the depot in Damascus has a bullet hole in every window. My seatmate on this bus is especially anxious. A boy of 17 from a village near Hama, 40km north of Homs, he is making his first unaccompanied trip home after enrolling at Damascus University. Three days earlier, his friend was injured by a stray sniper bullet on this same route; it might have been the rebels, but no&nbsp;one really knows. He points to the seat where his friend was hit; he says only pride prevents him from lying on the floor for the entire journey.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419774566'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381244587513/Homs-market-009.jpg' alt='Homs market' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>A street market in Karm al-Shami, central Homs, last month. Photograph: James Harkin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, the boy is no fan of the regime. His&nbsp;uncle was arrested 18 months ago and hasn't been heard of since; the family suspect he is dead. The people in his village have come to hate the rebels, too, he says. \"People are so, so bored with them. They come and blow up checkpoints outside towns and run away, then militias arrive and steal everything we have. They would steal even this,\" he says, pointing to my plastic cup. A poor woman from a nearby village had her only cow stolen by pro-regime militias; when a group of locals asked them to give it back, they told her it had said bad things about the president. Hama, long associated with anti-regime activity, is now very quiet, he&nbsp;says; there are so many soldiers there that oppositionists have learned to keep their mouths shut. \"The revolutionaries now accuse Hama of betrayal,\" the boy says. He is circumspect about his political beliefs even among his new university friends, because many might support the regime. \"When I'm around them, I say I love the president, that the terrorists should be punished.\"</p><p>Homs has been described in the west as a city under siege. This, I discover when Abu Ali drives me around it, is no longer the whole story. There are still enclaves under armed rebel control, including parts of the old city, where about 3,000 people are cut off from food and electricity, and living in appalling conditions. Elsewhere, the city is returning to a kind of nervy normality. Abu Ali explains that Homs divides into three areas: the rebel enclaves; pro-regime strongholds, often with large communities of Alawites; and areas with pro-opposition sympathies, such as the one where he lives, which are also tentatively controlled by the regime. In both these areas, the government subsidises the price of bread, and fresh food is plentiful, but prices have risen steeply and no one has the money to buy much. Abu Ali says the rebels had been smuggling food and drink into some areas through underground tunnels, but these were discovered and exploded by regime forces. It seems likely that these rebel strongholds will eventually fall to the regime, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/01/syrian-rebels-retreat-baba-amr-homs\" title=\"\">Baba Amr </a>did before them – this is the area of Homs where journalists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/marie-colvin\" title=\"\">Marie Colvin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/remi-ochlik\" title=\"\">Rémi Ochlik</a> were killed in February 2012. On our trip around the city, we drive past Baba Amr; while a few people have returned, it remains a shattered ruin and a&nbsp;warning from the regime to the rebels.</p><p>We pass through a checkpoint run by pro-regime paramilitaries, known by the oppositionists as shabiha, or ghosts. At one point he dashes out of the car to collect something and returns triumphant, having just been handed some money from a passerby to give to his refugees.</p><figure data-media-id='gu-image-419774567'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/10/8/1381244883869/Homs-site-of-three-deaths-009.jpg' alt='Homs site of three deaths' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>The row of shops where French journalist Gilles Jacquier was killed; it is close to the site where Abu Ali’s nephew and his fiancee were killed by rebel rockets in May this year. Photograph: James Harkin for the Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>We drop in on Amjad, a wiry fellow oppositionist who now considers both sides as bad as each other. \"When we watch CNN, France 24, even the BBC,\" he says, \"I don't think they are talking about Homs. It is lies.\" The regime certainly bombs buildings, he says, and it sometimes makes mistakes, but often it's because those buildings are being used as barracks by armed groups. \"We are lost between shabiha and debaha,\" he sighs, using the Arabic word for slaughterers to refer to the rise of puritanical, sectarian Islamism among the rebels. Amjad's brother, a 60-year-old taxi driver, was kidnapped on 4 May. There has been no demand for money or any other obvious motive; the family have not heard from him since.</p><p>Such kidnappings are rife. Some are for military reasons, Abu Ali says, others are motivated by money or religion; sometimes, it's all three. One of&nbsp;his former teachers, a rich artist and a&nbsp;very&nbsp;old man, was recently kidnapped by shabiha who want 24m Syrian pounds (about £100,000) for his release; he hopes to hear from the kidnappers in&nbsp;the next day or two. </p><p>Then there is Tariq, an Alawite recently kidnapped for largely sectarian reasons; armed rebels (what Abu Ali calls \"revolution shabiha\") are demanding the release of government&nbsp;detainees in exchange for his return.</p><p>On our way back to the car, Abu Ali points out the spot where his nephew and his fiancee were killed. Nearby is the row of shops where French journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/11/syria-homs-attack-convoy\" title=\"\">Gilles Jacquier </a>was killed in similar circumstances in January 2012. Jacquier's wife has written a book blaming the regime for the death, but Abu Ali, based on the geography and&nbsp;the pattern of attacks, dismisses this theory. He&nbsp;takes me to the abandoned tenement from&nbsp;which he believes the rocket was fired by&nbsp;anti-regime forces.</p><p>We head to an opposition area of the city, home almost exclusively to Sunni Muslims, for tea with some of Abu Ali's acquaintances. One is from the ruined Baba Amr district, and has twice been forced to leave his home when the army entered to rout the rebels. He won't talk to a journalist, he&nbsp;says, and sits clutching prayer beads. In any case, he adds, talking about it only makes him cry, and he has a problem with his corneas that means he can't let himself shed any tears. On the verge of crying, he changes the subject. Syrians are an optimistic people, he wants me to know, with 7,000 years of civilisation behind them; some of&nbsp;his best friends are Alawites and Christians, friendships born of coincidence, not religion. \"No&nbsp;one should have to see the things I've seen,\" is all he will say about Baba Amr. He stares out of&nbsp;the window like a blind man.</p><p>Abu Ali is of a generation for whom picking apart Syria's complex mosaic of religions and ethnicities remains a tasteless and unpatriotic business. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, he has never told me directly that he is&nbsp;an Alawite Muslim himself. This fact might make it easier for him to pass through some regime checkpoints, but it also poses certain risks. After&nbsp;our tour of the city, he drives me back to the home he shares with his wife in an opposition area called Shammas. It is on the sixth floor of a&nbsp;tenement block and only 800m from Baba Amr; like many homes in the area, there is a crack or crevice from a stray bullet in almost every room. Things aren't as bad as they were, he says, but sometimes he and his wife can't sleep for the noise of the mortars passing overhead and crashing into the ground.</p><p>Amjad, who used to live here, joins us for the ride. He, too, is an Alawite Muslim, and he moved from Shammas to Akrama because he was afraid that his daughters might attract insults in the street because of their religion: \"Just from young people, looking for revenge.\" Shammas, a&nbsp;formerly mixed neighbourhood, is slowly being drained of its Alawites; Abu Ali is one of the few who remains. \"He believes he is safe here,\" Amjad&nbsp;ribs him; it is clear he doesn't have the same confidence. For his part, Abu Ali says he has been stopped at several rebel checkpoints and never had any problems; then again, he is well known in&nbsp;the area, so his experience might not be representative. When he was ordered to leave by&nbsp;one armed group, another stepped in to guarantee his safety.</p><p>Beyond the bombs and the bullets, it is this creeping sectarian migration that represents the most ominous threat to Homs, and to Syria as a whole. Earlier that day, we discover, a Syrian army missile destroyed a building in a very densely populated area of the city, al-Waer, just a few kilometres away. Five hundred thousand people now live in al-Waer; half are recent arrivals, sent from other areas of the city as they have come under the control of armed rebels. Just about everyone there is a Sunni Muslim and the area is not fully under regime control. It is a no-go area even for Abu Ali. Conditions are poor; everyone has a home and bread to eat, but it is seriously overcrowded and some of the tenement blocks remain unfinished, without windows or doors. The regime relies on fortified military positions directly surrounding the area to keep an eye on&nbsp;residents, neutralising threats with rockets or&nbsp;snipers; it sounds like an open prison.</p><p>On a previous visit to Homs, I had met a young man who had been moved to al-Waer from a rebel enclave. We stayed in touch, and over the last few years his aspirations have shifted from getting a good job and a girlfriend to a growing sympathy with the extreme Islamism of the rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra. He's studying engineering at the city's Ba'ath University, but the checkpoints on the way there and back put the fear of God into him; the shabiha, he&nbsp;feels, can do what they like. A week before I&nbsp;travelled to Syria, and having refused all my previous offers to send a little cash, he had tentatively asked for money for his family: it struck me as a sign of growing desperation. \"Life is&nbsp;hard but we continue to live,\" he wrote. \"Here in Homs, all Sunni people want to leave to a safer place.\" He signed off: \"See you after victory.\"</p><p>In the evening, while his wife and I eat grapes and watch a popular Syrian crooner on television, Abu Ali sits in his pyjamas at his desk behind us, doing his accounts, catching up with friends on Facebook and Skype, making a few phone calls to&nbsp;try to find a lawyer for someone in prison. In passing, I see the figure of 120,000 he has written on a sheet of paper; this, it turns out, is someone's best guess at the number of people now being held in regime jails. I ask if there has been any news on his former teacher. The gang who kidnapped him have been persuaded to drop their ransom from 24m Syrian pounds to 3m, he says. Like most of&nbsp;the work Abu Ali does, it's progress of sorts, but still a long way from good news.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419383043|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|5928c478af5a2a11b3da597979dba534ea263f1c -->",

Six of the people kidnapped are ICRC staff and one is a volunteer from the Syrian Red Crescent, he said.</p><p>Schorno declined to provide the nationalities of the six ICRC employees.</p><p>Syria's state news agency, quoting an anonymous official, said the gunmen opened fire on the ICRC team's four vehicles before seizing the Red Cross workers. The news agency blamed terrorists, a term the government uses to refer to those opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>Schorno said the team of seven had been in the field since October 10 to assess the medical situation in the area and to look at how to provide medical aid. He said the part of northern Syria where they were seized by definition is a difficult area to go in.</p><p>Much of the countryside in Idlib province, as well as the rest of northern Syria, has fallen into the hands of rebels over the past year and kidnappings have become rife, particularly of aid workers and foreign journalists.</p><!-- Guardian Watermark: internal-code/content/419844432|2013-10-17T10:28:06Z|8dfa6cb9d9add1c84a03d3af70ab7c7202dc4a58 -->",
