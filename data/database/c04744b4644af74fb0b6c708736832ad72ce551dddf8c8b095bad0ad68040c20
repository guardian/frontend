Many critics carped that the film didn't live up to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and sounded a note of scepticism over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/13/peter-jackson-48fps-tone-down-hobbit-desolation-smaug-hd\" title=\"\">the innovative 48 frames-per-second projection</a>. Still, audiences continued to embrace the film, and a final gross of £52.33m represented a healthy 5.5 multiple of the opening number – a relatively high ratio for a Hollywood blockbuster.</p><p>Now sequel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154178/hobbit\" title=\"\">The Desolation of Smaug</a> arrives with a very similar £9.32m, slightly down on the original. A better Metacritic score of 66/100 (as opposed to 58/100 for Unexpected Journey) suggests that the film has found an easier ride from critics, and an IMDb user rating of 8.5/10 (8.0/10 for the earlier film) might indicate similar greater enthusiasm among cinemagoers. (A word of caution: the eager postings of early adopters can give an initial boost to IMDb user ratings, which then gradually decline as more film fans weigh in with their verdicts.)</p><p>Among films released in 2012, An Unexpected Journey ended up as the third-highest grosser, behind only Skyfall and The Dark Knight Rises. So far in 2013, the top title is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155771/despicable-me-2\">Despicable Me 2</a>, with £47.2m. Since no film has managed £50m this year (in 2012, there were four that passed that milestone), this means that The Desolation of Smaug has every chance of becoming the year's top grosser – although of course it won't achieve this feat by 31 December. All will depend on how audiences respond to Smaug, and whether it can achieve a sustained, robust run like the one delivered by An Unexpected Journey.</p><h2>The runner-up</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-411025754\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/6/18/130618Frozen-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/6/18/130618Frozen-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/6/18/130618Frozen_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/6/18/130618Frozen/130618Frozen.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/6/18/130618Frozen_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/6/25/130618Frozen_vpx.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p> With family films for the festive season, it's not so much about the opening weekend as the full period up to Christmas Eve: virtually the whole of December can be golden. And that looks very much set to be the case with the animated film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155770/frozen\" title=\"\">Frozen</a>. Having opened the previous frame with an impressive £4.7m, the Disney flick has delivered a sensational second session of £4.21m – a decline of just 11%. Among family films this year, not even Despicable Me 2 managed second-weekend takings above £4m.</p><p>After 10 days, Frozen has clocked up a very handy £10.3m, which compares with a similar £10.52m for Disney's Wreck-It Ralph at the same stage of its run, and £8.63m for Monsters University. Those films achieved final tallies of £23.78m and £30.64m respectively, and Disney will be hoping that Frozen lands at a similar place. And since there is no particular plot connection between Frozen and the Christmas holiday, there is no reason why the film couldn't continue to engage audiences beyond 25 December and into wintry January.</p><h2>The year to date</h2><p>This will be the final UK box-office report for 2013 – and in fact the column will be on a three-week hiatus – so it seems a good chance to take stock of the year. Below is a special one-off chart featuring the year's top 30 hits. As usual, there is a strong domination by sequels and films based on existing hit properties, such as stage musical Les Misérables, comic-book icon Superman and books including The Great Gatsby and World War Z. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156058/gravity\" title=\"\">Gravity</a> is a notable exception, repaying backers Warners' $100m gamble on a potentially cerebral space drama with no pre-existing brand recognition. Sony, which has suffered some turmoil in 2013, achieved its biggest hits with a pair of original properties – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154515/captain-phillips\" title=\"\">Captain Phillips</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144406/django-unchained\" title=\"\">Django Unchained</a> – unless you count Richard Phillips' 2010 book or the 1966 film Django starring Franco Nero. Investors demanding a more blockbuster-driven strategy might pause to consider what actually worked for the studio.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-411773435\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2/130728CutdownDespicableMe2.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2-720.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p> Animation has had a particularly strong year in 2013. Not only is the top title (so far) Despicable Me 2, there are two more animations – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155588/monsters-university\" title=\"\">Monsters University</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/151435/croods\" title=\"\">The Croods</a> – in the year's top 10, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150381/wreck-it-ralph\" title=\"\">Wreck-It Ralph</a> is just outside. Frozen should make a fifth animated feature at £20m-plus by year's end.</p><h2>The festive flop</h2><p>Generating a lot of publicity – much of it negative – surrounding the casting of Britain's Got Talent winner Susan Boyle, festive period tale <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/158849/christmas-candle\">The Christmas Candle</a> failed to engage cinema audiences in limited play. Released on a very modest 11 screens, the film achieved a gross of £7,747. Investors presumably hope the film will be a DVD gifting staple for older family members in years to come.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>Overall the box office is a slim 1% up on the equivalent weekend from 2012, when the original Hobbit film and DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians occupied the top two spots in the chart. This extends to four weeks a run where takings were up on the year-ago equivalent, following an eight-week run where box-office lagged behind 2012. Now cinema owners are hoping for a strong hold from both Smaug and Frozen, plus nice returns from the arrival on 18 December of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155772/anchorman\" title=\"\">Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</a>, followed on Friday by The Harry Hill Movie, Moshi Monsters and Walking with Dinosaurs. David O Russell's acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156243/american-hustle\" title=\"\">American Hustle</a> is in London's West End only prior to its nationwide expansion on January 1.

An Unexpected Journey, so demanding that <a href=\"http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/hobbit-x-men-star-sir-ian-mckellen-reveals-122700055.html?\">he almost quit acting</a>.</p><p>The revelation was contained in comments McKellen made on the extended edition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, recently released on DVD and Blu-Ray.</p><p>Forced by the exigencies of director Peter Jackson's visual-effects-oriented shoot in New Zealand to work in isolation for long periods, McKellen said: \"I felt pretty miserable … and thought perhaps, has the time come for me to stop acting altogether if I can't cope with these difficulties?\"</p><p>McKellen's particular problems arise because his character, Gandalf the Grey, is supposed to tower over most of the other, shorter characters, both Hobbit and dwarf. To create the false perspective, he had to be filmed separately, on a greenscreen set, and the backgrounds and other characters added later in the editing suite.</p><p>\"It was so distressing and off-putting and difficult that I thought 'I don't want to make this film if this is what I'm going to have to do',\" McKellen added. \"It's not what I do for a living. I act with other people, I don't act on my own.\" </p><p>Jackson, however, says he noticed McKellen's unhappiness and encouraged him to keep going despite the isolation. \"He truly had such a miserable time on the first day or two of the shoot. We felt sorry for him being dumped in greenscreen land.\"</p><p>The crew also staged an impromptu \"Gandalf appreciation day\" and cheered up the actor by decorating his tent with props from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/lord-of-the-rings\">Lord of the Rings</a> films.</p><p>The actor stuck with the film and returned for the second Hobbit instalment, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154178/hobbit\">The Desolation of Smaug</a>, which is due for release in the UK and UK on 13 December, and on Boxing Day in Australia.</p><p><a

He began his Hobbit trilogy at an amiable, meanderingly wayward canter, and tried the patience of believers and non-believers alike with that initial supper scene, almost an epic in itself. But this second episode commences with a narrative whipcrack – a quick flashback to Gandalf and Thorin tensely discussing their great plan in the snug bar of the Prancing Pony – and then we're off, at a tremendous gallop. </p><p>The Desolation of Smaug is a cheerfully entertaining and exhilarating adventure tale, a supercharged Saturday morning picture: it's mysterious and strange and yet Jackson also effortlessly conjures up that genial quality that distinguishes The Hobbit from the more solemn Rings stories. The absurdity is winning: you're laughing with, not laughing at. For me, it never sagged once in its mighty two hour 40 minutes running time and the high-frame-rate projection for this film somehow looks richer and denser than it did the last time around. Maybe I'm just getting used to it. Jackson has shown that he is an expert in big-league popular movie-making to rival Lucas and Spielberg. His Smaug, with its fight scenes, chase spectaculars, creepy creatures and secret stone doors opening with a grinding noise, is something to set alongside the Indiana Jones films.<br /> <br />The end of the second movie out of three gives us a chance to revisit that critical question: does The Hobbit story work at this great length?  Does epic-i-sation risk making The Hobbit too dour? In the book itself, Tolkien wrote: \"Things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway.\" So perhaps Tolkien anticipated the way in which fantasy can grow exponentially, spinning substance out of itself, and become more and more serious and even solemn. Yet this second Hobbit film has real energy and charm.<br /> <br />Smaug is of course the terrible dragon, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, who has usurped the Lonely Mountain and the dwarf kingdom of Erebor with all its gold, and whom the dwarves and Bilbo Baggins are on a mission to unseat. The \"desolation\" is the wasteland he has imposed on the country thereabouts, rather than any depression the dragon himself may be feeling. Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) is the alpha dwarf, grimly intent on his destiny: to reclaim his people's heritage and homeland. Martin Freeman is Bilbo, and Freeman's laidback, more naturalistic line-readings make a pleasing and interesting contrast to the more contoured saga-speak that comes out of everyone else's mouth, whether they are speaking English or Elvish or the guttural Orc tongue.<br /> <br />Bilbo is reluctant to confide the truth about the ring in his possession to Ian McKellen's Gandalf, who absents himself from the party reasonably early on, leaving that visually striking group looking and feeling vulnerable. Poor little Bilbo playing a non-Snow-White to the even littler dwarves as they trail across the magnificent landscape – but who are in fact tougher, more aggressive and more resilient than him.<br /> <br />A series of bizarre fantasy episodes, in a kind of Jackson-Tolkien-rococo style, brings us closer and closer to the mountain. The dwarves encounter Beorn the skin-changer who agrees, albeit churlishly, to help. The company finds itself lost and somehow spiritually oppressed in the forest of Mirkwood in which they get up close and personal with some colossal and very nasty spiders, which loom out of the screen in three dimensions, encasing their prisoners with skin-crawling webs. But the most uproarious setpiece comes when Bilbo, Thorin and the dwarves escape from the wood-elves' prison by hiding in barrels that are washed away down the river – which will bring them in contact with Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) and then the vain, shifty and time-serving Lord of Laketown, enjoyably played by Stephen Fry.<br /> <br />The barrel-chase down the river is a great sequence: a full-tilt headspinning action spectacular with orc against elf against dwarf-and-hobbit. Somehow, the whole movie has this same huge propulsive energy, whooshing the heroes onwards towards their great goal. Despite the dwarves' tough reputations, and Bilbo's expertise in the ignoble art of burglary, their diminutive size always gives them a weirdly childlike air: an air of outraged and unquenchable innocence. Bilbo's showdown with the terrible Smaug himself is of course the great finale, a narrative rhyme to his faceoff with Gollum that concluded the last film, and a satisfyingly exotic event.<br /> <br />And all the time, Jackson's New Zealand landscape has a storybook beauty, a fitting habitat for this story which unfolds in all seasons and times of day: fallen snowflakes gather in beards, the last rays of sunset glints in fur. Jackson depicts this fantasy world with style and gusto, and I'm looking forward to the third film already.</p>","headline":"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - review","trailText":"<p>The second

screamed Quentin Tarantino in self-congratulatory mode, during a 2001 interview on the subject of his forthcoming samurai epic Kill Bill. The film was set to compensate loyal followers for years of creative inertia, so it seemed more than a little odd when he later split the movie in two at the behest of its producers. His beloved fans would now be expected to pay for two separate tickets and wait an extra six months to see Bill meet his maker, and all to ensure a larger box office take for backers Miramax Films. The reaction was far from appreciative.</p><p>Fast-forward a decade and last year's announcement that The Hobbit – just 310 pages long in book form – would be stretched across three lengthy epics <strong>(1)</strong> was met with a fan reaction verging on the priapic. So when did audiences become so deferential to a release strategy blatantly motivated by naked financial gain?</p><p>The trend has grown apace since Tarantino's double Bill proved a financial godsend for Miramax, while audience resistance has dwindled to nothing. When the producers of the Harry Potter franchise split Deathly Hallows down the middle in 2010 (that's 3.5 horcruxes a film, stats fans) it still felt like a dicey manoeuvre. Three years later, a two-part conclusion is practically de rigueur, with The Hunger Games' final chapter Mockingjay set to double-team audiences across the autumns of 2014 and 2015 <strong>(2)</strong>. Where fanboys and girls once felt hard done by such a mercenary approach to film distribution, now they actively petition studios to extend their tired franchises into oblivion <strong>(3)</strong>.</p><p>In some ways, the trend harks back to the age of cinema intermissions –&nbsp;short breaks in the middle of lengthy films designed to allow projectionists to change reels and audience members to stretch their legs and/or sneak into neighbouring screens. In 1969, a screening of Paint Your Wagon wasn't complete without the chance to stop halfway, have a breather and ponder whether or not Lee Marvin would manage to tame Jean Seberg's headstrong ways come the second act.</p><p>The problem was that intermissions meant longer running times, which in turn meant fewer screenings per day. Why, the studios reasoned, should they give audiences three hours' entertainment for the price of one admission when they could hold half the narrative hostage for 12 months and double their money <strong>(4)</strong>? What we're left with is the movies' equivalent of those magazine subscriptions that promise you a die-cast Porsche but don't give you the tailpipe until week 79. The Hobbit's tailpipe will be shipped out next December, in the form of final franchise entry There And Back Again, but Tolkien obsessives need not despair. In an interview with MTV last year, director Peter Jackson (whose net worth was recently estimated at £220m) revealed that additional Middle-Earth movies would be a \"fine idea\".

He was very attached to his tropical fish; at the end of each day he'd melt into a beanbag and gaze at them endlessly. But as the movies got bigger, stealing him from his London home for months at a time, they had to go. \"These discus were <em>beautiful</em>. The fish man came into my house and scooped them out into bags, gave me £20 for them. I said, 'Just take them, it's all too much...' So the fish tank is now in the attic and shall stay there until I can afford to not work, when I'll look at fish all day long.\"</p><p>After breaking into the film world in 2010, Evans was suddenly everywhere: five films in that first year, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/134747/clash-of-the-titans\" title=\"\">Clash Of The Titans</a>, Robin Hood and Tamara Drewe. Summer 2013 found him snarling at Vin Diesel as Fast &amp; Furious 6's bad boy, while this week's Hobbit sequel sees him play the altogether more heroic Bard The Bowman. His first leads follow soon: he recently wrapped Dracula Untold, which takes the bloodsucker back to his roots, and is now filming a remake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/24/the-crow-remake-legal-row\" title=\"\">The Crow</a>. From nowhere, this 34-year-old Welshman seems to have waltzed into Hollywood and gobbled up all the franchises.</p><p>\"Well, I had a lot of ground to cover,\" he says. \"It happened overnight in a way, but for 10 years I was struggling through theatre. All those wonderful experiences, living on kebabs and all that shit. But it is sometimes being in the right place at the right time.\"</p><h2>'I feel like I've put Aberbargoed on the map for something other than once having had the biggest slag heap in Europe'</h2><p>Born to a bricklayer and a cleaner in Aberbargoed, a tiny village in the Welsh valleys, Evans partly attributes his tenacity to his upbringing as a Jehovah's Witness. His family didn't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and his education was miserable. \"I was often looked at as a leper by kids at school, because I was a Jehovah's Witness. They didn't like it – you were 'weird'. And on Saturday mornings you'd be knocking at their doors. I remember standing there with my mum and dad, thinking, 'Oh my God, I know whose door this is, and I'll have to see them on Monday.' It was terrible.\"</p><p>Terrible but character building? \"Well, I'm still here, and I'm smiling,\" he says, explaining that being bullied gave him thick skin and that having doors slammed in his face prepared him for rejection. \"When I didn't get a job I thought, 'Don't worry, there'll be another one.' I still live by that now. Nothing really fazes me any more.\"</p><p>Evans had always wanted to sing, so at 16 he left school, quit the Jehovah's Witnesses and got a job to finance some singing lessons. He won a scholarship to The London Studio Centre, graduated in 2000 and rose up the theatrical ranks for nine years, starring in the likes of Rent and Miss Saigon. Then, off the back of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/17/theatre\" title=\"\">Small Change</a> at the Donmar Warehouse, he auditioned for the 2009 film adaptation of Dorian Gray. He didn't get the role, but his audition tape did the rounds in LA. \"A lot of people said, 'Who's this guy? Where's he been?' That's how it all began.\"</p><p>In the new Hobbit he plays Bard The Bowman, a character with a particular set of skills (well, one) – a small role in the book that's been beefed up for Peter Jackson's expanded interpretation. \"We haven't added a whole plotline that doesn't exist, but Bard's story has more breathing space to move,\" says Evans, who was on set for almost a year. \"It's a very exciting part of the film, and we really do give Bard his moment.\" Also, for the first time on film he was asked to use his own accent. As a result, Bard's family are Welsh. \"I feel like I've put Aberbargoed on the map for something other than once having had the biggest slag heap in Europe,\" he laughs.</p><p>Did he have a strategy for conquering Hollywood? \"Definitely, because I was starting in the business way later than most people. My team have been very clear in where they saw me.\" He's on screen for all of 12 seconds in Clash Of The Titans, but merely having the chance to exploit that movie on his CV set off a chain reaction.</p><p>\"I was 30, a fully fledged man, I wasn't a twinkie kid. I didn't have a pretty face, I had rugged lines. I'm not a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/twilight\" title=\"\">Twilight</a> boy, I'll never be as good looking as those lads, and that's fair enough. I'm this dude that can play a farmhand and a handyman and sometimes a Greek god. And now I'm playing Count Dracula,\" he grins, very happy with his lot. The fish will have to wait.</p><p><em>The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug is out in the UK on 13 Dec</em></p>","headline":"Hobbit star Luke Evans swaps the valleys for the Shire","trailText":"<p>At the age of 30, this Welsh actor became an overnight success.

</video><h2>Holiday season hit-making</h2><p>'Tis the season when studio chiefs with the right movies rub their hands/smart phones in glee, manage a half-smile and issue impersonal notes of thanks to the minions for all their hard work. Holiday season means hits and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155770/frozen\" title=\"\">Frozen</a> has the makings of one. Not every Disney animation is a dead cert these days – to wit, Planes – but the latest release from the production line appears to have what it takes to become a blockbuster. It climbed to top spot in North America in its third weekend, reaching an estimated $134.2m (£81.9m). Really, this figure should be viewed as a two-weekend result because the opening session was limited to a single theatre. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154178/hobbit\" title=\"\">The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug</a> arrives this week but that shouldn't diminish the very young audience too much so long as their parents can resist the temptations of Middle Earth. Frozen will stick around until the end of the year and continue to notch up excellent business for the studio.</p><h2>Another spectacular limited-release debut</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-408568790\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/5/9/130509LlewynDavis-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/5/9/130509LlewynDavis-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/5/9/130509LlewynDavis/130509LlewynDavis.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/5/9/130509LlewynDavis_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/5/9/130509LlewynDavis_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p> There's been a few great limited releases in recent months as savvy distributors roll out their big awards hopefuls in a small number of venues before edging up towards a wider release. The weekend's star performer was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154516/inside-llewyn-davis\" title=\"\">Inside Llewyn Davis</a>, the Coen brothers' take on the folk scene in 1961 New York that, in typically arch fashion, is not about Bob Dylan. The movie won the Gotham best feature award last week, and lead actor Oscar Isaac is nominated for an Independent Spirit award, so it arrives with its bona fides intact. $401,000 (£244,666) from four theatres would suggest audiences are eager to see it.</p><h2>Out of the Furnace</h2><figure data-media-id='gu-image-424523172'><img src='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2013/12/9/1386589231183/Out-of-the-Furnace-008.jpg' alt='Out of the Furnace' width='460' height='276' class='gu-image'/><figcaption>Redneck kingdom … Out of the Furnace. Photograph: Kerry Hayes/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Alas, the same cannot be said for the Christian Bale drama Out of the Furnace, which opened at No 3 through Relativity Media on $5.3m (£3.2m) from 2,101 sites. Scott Cooper directs his first film since Crazy Heart, which earned Jeff Bridges his best actor Oscar in 2010. The first half is an intriguing story of revenge that plays out in the terrifyingly remote Appalachian kingdom of a redneck monster portrayed by Woody Harrelson. The second half descends into formula, but the movie is still worth a gander. Shame about the release, because a potential awards outsider like this needs every bit of positive energy it can get. If it fades away in a week or so, it will be hard to maintain any kind of momentum.</p><h2>Dallas Buyers Club is a yo-yo</h2><p>Focus Features' true-story drama has flirted with the top 10 for several weeks now – the past four sessions have seen it register 12, 10, 12 and 10 in the charts, and that's no bad thing if it keeps <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156634/dallas-buyers-club\" title=\"\">Dallas Buyers Club</a> alive in voters' minds. You get the sense there's a way to go yet, especially if the Los Angeles Film Critics Association best supporting actor prize for Jared Leto on Sunday night starts the ball rolling. Leto and Matthew McConaughey are much fancied for their performances. The latter, of course, plays the lead as the lateRon Woodruff, who, after being diagnosed HIV-positive, smuggles more effective drugs into the US to keep patients like himself alive. So far, the movie has grossed $12.4m.</p><h2>How high can Smaug go?</h2><p>So this week will see the release of The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug and, thankfully, early reviews are saying it's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/08/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug-review\" title=\"\">a considerable improvement on Peter Jackson's dreary first-parter last year</a>. Speaking of which, An Unexpected Journey is the December record-holder on $84.6m (£51.6m) so that's the target for Smaug. $90m (£54.9m) would not appear beyond its reach, given that sequels usually fare better than their predecessors so long as the first movie was beloved. An Unexpected Journey was no Lord of the Rings, but it probably just about did enough to inspire a bigger opening weekend for Smaug.</p><h2>North American top 10, 6-8 December 2013</h2><p>1 <a

But part two, which features the debut of Smaug, the Benedict Cumberbatch-voiced dragon, is picking up strong early reviews.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/hobbit-desolation-smaug/review/663372\" title=\"\">Todd McCarthy of the Hollywood Reporter</a> writes:</p><blockquote><p>Nearly everything … represents an improvement over the first instalment of Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation of JRR Tolkien's beloved creation,\" \"After exhibiting an almost craven fidelity to his source material the first time out, Jackson gets the drama in gear here from the outset with a sense of storytelling that possesses palpable energy and purpose. Toward the end, his perennial tendency to let bloat creep in reasserts itself to an extent … he has a hard time knowing when enough is enough even as the three-hour goalpost looms dead ahead. But for the most part he moves the episodic tale along with reasonable speed for a leviathan while serving up enough fights, close shaves and action-filled melodrama for an old-fashioned movie serial or a modern video game.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137814\" title=\"\">Nick de Semlyen of Empire magazine</a> labels The Desolation of Smaug \"a huge improvement on the previous instalment\". He writes:</p><blockquote><p>One problem with the former film was that it re-trod too closely the footsteps of the Fellowship: it was difficult to share Bilbo's awe at entering Rivendell, given that we'd already been there 11 years before. Here, you can feel Jackson's relief at having entirely new worlds in which to play. </p><p>The forest domain of the Silvan Elves has beauty edged with menace … but the real standouts are Lake-town and Erebor, contrasting but equally stunning showcases of production design. The former, a fog-shrouded, Dickensian burg that we're informed 'stinks of fish oil and tar', is a new, pleasingly earthy flavour for Middle-earth. Kingdom-under-the-mountain Erebor, on the other hand, is the kind of mad location that could only exist on a Weta mega-computer, its centrepiece a stash of wealth so vast it would give Scrooge McDuck a quacking fit.</p></blockquote><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-410590833\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/6/12/130712Smuag-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/6/12/130712Smuag-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/6/12/130712Smuag/130712Smuag.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/6/12/130712Smuag_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/6/12/130712Smuag_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source>\n      </video><p>My colleague Peter Bradshaw is also impressed with the manner in which Jackson has \"picked up the pace\" in part two.</p><p>He says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/08/the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug-review\" title=\"\">in his four-star review</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The Desolation of Smaug is a cheerfully entertaining and exhilarating adventure tale, a supercharged Saturday morning picture.</p><p>It's mysterious and strange and yet Jackson also effortlessly conjures up that genial quality that distinguishes The Hobbit from the more solemn Rings stories. The absurdity is winning: you're laughing with, not laughing at. For me, it never sagged once in its mighty two hour 40 minutes running time and the high-frame-rate projection for this film somehow looks richer and denser than it did the last time round. Jackson has shown that he is an expert in big-league popular movie-making to rival Lucas and Spielberg.</p></blockquote><p>The Telegraph's Robbie Collin, however, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10502508/The-Hobbit-The-Desolation-of-Smaug-review.html\" title=\"\">remains unimpressed with Jackson's decision to film a breezy children's tome as three epic movies</a>. He reckons part two is \"mostly stalling for time\" and largely dismisses it as \"two or three truly great sequences tangled up in long beards and longer pit-stops\".</p><p>Adds Collin:</p><blockquote><p>The tone is 100% Jackson – a kind of thundering gloominess, cut with the occasional glint of Discworld mischief. Jackson and his co-writers, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have decapitated bodies twitching on the ground, and a captured dwarf leering at a female elf: 'Aren't you going to search me? I could have anything down my trousers.' Maybe this really is what a lot of people want to see from a film version of The Hobbit, but let's at least accept that Tolkien would probably not have been among them.</p></blockquote><p>The new film currently has a rating of <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_hobbit_the_desolation_of_smaug/\" title=\"\">79%  on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes</a>, a full 13-point gain on predecessor An Unexpected Journey, if hardly Oscars-bait territory. The Desolation of Smaug arrives in cinemas worldwide on 13 December 2013.</p>","headline":"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug – reviews roundup","trailText":"<p>The second instalment of Peter

For the first time, I \"got\" the JRR Tolkien/Peter Jackson experience. I&nbsp;tuned into the frequency. I tasted the fusion cuisine. I heard the eccentric but weirdly rousing choral harmonies. And this is despite – or more probably because of – never having been a Tolkien fan and being agnostic about the myth-making and, indeed, the prose quality. I never had any dogmatic sense of how the original should be represented or any loyalty to childhood fandom, and in fact I came to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in 2001 with some unbelief, though as the Rings series progressed I&nbsp;was forced – with some churlish ill-grace – to admire those movies' mighty ambition and scope. With the Hobbit series, the penny is properly dropping: it's not about Tolkien, it's Tolkien-plus-Jackson, of course. It's morphed into something new.</p><p>This movie is tremendously enjoyable, and considering how exotic it is, The Desolation of Smaug is weirdly unassuming. It rattles along, never drags, and is always terrifically likable: open, genial and good-natured. The legend is revealing itself to be a&nbsp;rich and potent source of entertainment. Perhaps the point is, as Graham Greene once said about God, you need a sense of humour to believe.</p><p>There's a small caveat. Before I sat down to it, I earnestly pondered the words in my press handout restating the importance of Jackson's technological innovation, HFR or high frame rate, 48 frames per second rather than the conventional 24. The first Hobbit movie in HFR had looked worryingly like daytime television, but I noted that this second film looked much better and wondered if I was just getting used to it. Actually, the projection I saw was in the usual 24&nbsp;frames a second – as will be 80% of&nbsp;the screenings around the country. Perhaps HFR is one of those innovations that might have to be discreetly de-innovated.</p><p>At any rate, The Desolation of Smaug gets off to a mighty gallop. It's a&nbsp;cheerfully exhilarating adventure tale, a supercharged Saturday morning picture. Jackson shows that he is an expert in big-league popular moviemaking to rival Lucas and Spielberg. His Smaug, with its fight scenes, chase spectaculars, creepy creatures and secret stone doors that open with a&nbsp;grinding noise, is something to set alongside the Indiana&nbsp;Jones films.</p><p>Smaug is, of course, the terrible dragon, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, who has usurped the Lonely Mountain and the dwarf kingdom of Erebor with all its gold, and whom the dwarves and Bilbo Baggins are on a mission to unseat. The \"desolation\" is the wasteland he has imposed on the country thereabouts, rather than any depression the dragon may be feeling. Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) is the alpha dwarf, grimly intent on his destiny: to reclaim his people's heritage and homeland. Martin Freeman is Bilbo, and Freeman's laidback, more naturalistic line readings make a pleasing and interesting contrast to the more contoured saga-speak that comes out of everyone else's mouth, whether they are speaking English or Elvish or the guttural Orcish.</p><p>A series of fantasy episodes, in the Jackson-Tolkien-rococo style, brings us closer and closer to the mountain, and the most uproarious sequence comes when Bilbo, Thorin and the dwarves escape from the Wood Elves' prison by hiding in barrels that are washed down the river, bringing them in contact with Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) and then the vain, shifty and time-serving Lord of Laketown, played with florid gusto by Stephen Fry.</p><p>The barrel chase down the river is such a great setpiece: a head-spinning action spectacular with orc against elf against dwarf and hobbit. Somehow, the whole movie has this same huge, propulsive energy, whooshing the heroes onwards towards their great goal. Despite the dwarves' tough reputations, and Bilbo's expertise in the ignoble art of burglary, their diminutive size always gives them a weirdly childlike air in this story: an air of outraged and unquenchable innocence. Bilbo's showdown with the terrible Smaug is, of course, the great finale, a&nbsp;narrative rhyme to his face-off with Gollum that concluded the last film.</p><p>And all the time, Jackson's New Zealand landscape has a storybook beauty, a fitting habitat for this story that unfolds in all seasons and times of day: fallen snowflakes gather in beards, the last rays of sunset glint in fur. Jackson depicts this fantasy world with energy and charm, and I'm looking forward to the third film.</p>","headline":"The Hobbit: The Desolation of&nbsp;Smaug – review","trailText":"<p>Finally I get it!

href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/16/the-hobbit-unexpected-journey-review\" title=\"\"><em>An Unexpected Journey</em></a>, Peter Jackson gets back on track with this second instalment in his ongoing adaptation of Tolkien's slim novel – albeit with the addition of umpteen appendices to flesh out the narrative. With less whimsical waffle than its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>The Desolation of Smaug</em>&nbsp;sets off at a comparatively yomping pace and proceeds to throw an endless array of spectacular sights at the audience, eager to dazzle, ready to please.</p><p>Thus we head east, through the forest of Mirkwood with its creepy pre/post-Potter spiders; to the streets of Lake-town where the stench of fish hangs heavy in the Hammer-esque fog; then on to the lost kingdom of Erebor, a big-screen version of the Magic Mountain fairground ride replete with slidey loops and precipitous drops aplenty. En route we meet an assortment of fantastical characters of all shapes and sizes, ranging from the Wood-elves (a surprise return by Orlando Bloom's Legolas and a newly made-up character, Evangeline Lilly's Tauriel), to the gigantic dragon Smaug, voiced (and motion-captured) by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch\" title=\"\">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>, and brought to roaring life by the digital wizards at Weta. At the centre of it all is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/martin-freeman\" title=\"\">Martin Freeman</a>, whose default expression of habitual bafflement (he appears to teeter perpetually on the brink of some conversational incline) is perfectly suited to the role of Bilbo Baggins – the friendly quizzicality hiding something behind the smile as he begins to comprehend both the powers and dangers of the ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While the sing-song reminiscing and endless tea-party pootlings of <em>An Unexpected Journey</em>&nbsp;are happily notable by their absence, the jury is still out on whether&nbsp;<em>The Hobbit</em>&nbsp;really <em>needs</em> to be strung out over nine hours of film. For all its hi-tech action sequences and handsomely mounted set pieces, you get a lot of bagginess with your Baggins, as the assembled masses march up hill and down dale, their ultimate goal still a long way off. It doesn't help that the constantly sweeping visuals sometimes have the air of a supercharged computer game (an ultra-modded version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/skyrim\" title=\"\"><em>Skyrim</em></a> with mountain staircases by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/16/minecraft-game-no-rules-changed-gaming\" title=\"\"><em>Minecraft</em></a>?) or that sequences such as a barrel ride down a river seem tailor-made for the theme park market. Those agnostic on the subject of Tolkien's genius will sigh at all the usual tropes (here's a map, here's a key, and here's yet another character introduced in sombre tones as Hrithky Hroth of Biddly Bong, third cousin of Thriddledeedee the Thwarted) but more pressing is the question of whether devotees of the book will find their patience tested (perhaps exhausted?) by Jackson's everything-turned-up-to-11 aesthetic. As for the much-hyped high frame rate that proved so divisive last time around, only 20% of UK screenings of Smaug will be projected at 48 frames per second second, signalling a loss of confidence in the technical innovation The Hobbit trilogy was supposed to usher in.</p><p>Something of a mixed bag, then, with several question marks left hanging over the entire <em>Hobbit</em> project, but a definite improvement on the previous outing, and hopefully a portent of better things  to come in <em>There and Back Again</em>.</p>","headline":"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug –

</video><p> Exactly a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125622/hobbit\">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</a> opened in the UK with £9.51m, plus £2.1m in previews. Many critics carped that the film didn't live up to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and sounded a note of scepticism over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/13/peter-jackson-48fps-tone-down-hobbit-desolation-smaug-hd\" title=\"\">the innovative 48 frames-per-second projection</a>. Still, audiences continued to embrace the film, and a final gross of £52.33m represented a healthy 5.5 multiple of the opening number – a relatively high ratio for a Hollywood blockbuster.</p><p>Now sequel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154178/hobbit\" title=\"\">The Desolation of Smaug</a> arrives with a very similar £9.32m, slightly down on the original. A better Metacritic score of 66/100 (as opposed to 58/100 for Unexpected Journey) suggests that the film has found an easier ride from critics, and an IMDb user rating of 8.5/10 (8.0/10 for the earlier film) might indicate similar greater enthusiasm among cinemagoers. (A word of caution: the eager postings of early adopters can give an initial boost to IMDb user ratings, which then gradually decline as more film fans weigh in with their verdicts.)</p><p>Among films released in 2012, An Unexpected Journey ended up as the third-highest grosser, behind only Skyfall and The Dark Knight Rises. So far in 2013, the top title is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155771/despicable-me-2\">Despicable Me 2</a>, with £47.2m. Since no film has managed £50m this year (in 2012, there were four that passed that milestone), this means that The Desolation of Smaug has every chance of becoming the year's top grosser – although of course it won't achieve this feat by 31 December. All will depend on how audiences respond to Smaug, and whether it can achieve a sustained, robust run like the one delivered by An Unexpected Journey.</p><h2>The runner-up</h2><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-411025754\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/6/18/130618Frozen-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/6/18/130618Frozen-720.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/6/18/130618Frozen_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/6/18/130618Frozen/130618Frozen.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/6/18/130618Frozen_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/640/2013/6/25/130618Frozen_vpx.webm\"></source>\n      </video><p> With family films for the festive season, it's not so much about the opening weekend as the full period up to Christmas Eve: virtually the whole of December can be golden. And that looks very much set to be the case with the animated film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155770/frozen\" title=\"\">Frozen</a>. Having opened the previous frame with an impressive £4.7m, the Disney flick has delivered a sensational second session of £4.21m – a decline of just 11%. Among family films this year, not even Despicable Me 2 managed second-weekend takings above £4m.</p><p>After 10 days, Frozen has clocked up a very handy £10.3m, which compares with a similar £10.52m for Disney's Wreck-It Ralph at the same stage of its run, and £8.63m for Monsters University. Those films achieved final tallies of £23.78m and £30.64m respectively, and Disney will be hoping that Frozen lands at a similar place. And since there is no particular plot connection between Frozen and the Christmas holiday, there is no reason why the film couldn't continue to engage audiences beyond 25 December and into wintry January.</p><h2>The year to date</h2><p>This will be the final UK box-office report for 2013 – and in fact the column will be on a three-week hiatus – so it seems a good chance to take stock of the year. Below is a special one-off chart featuring the year's top 30 hits. As usual, there is a strong domination by sequels and films based on existing hit properties, such as stage musical Les Misérables, comic-book icon Superman and books including The Great Gatsby and World War Z. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/156058/gravity\" title=\"\">Gravity</a> is a notable exception, repaying backers Warners' $100m gamble on a potentially cerebral space drama with no pre-existing brand recognition. Sony, which has suffered some turmoil in 2013, achieved its biggest hits with a pair of original properties – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/154515/captain-phillips\" title=\"\">Captain Phillips</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144406/django-unchained\" title=\"\">Django Unchained</a> – unless you count Richard Phillips' 2010 book or the 1966 film Django starring Franco Nero. Investors demanding a more blockbuster-driven strategy might pause to consider what actually worked for the studio.</p><video data-media-id=\"gu-video-411773435\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">\n        <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2/130728CutdownDespicableMe2.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/6/28/130728CutdownDespicableMe2-720.mp4\"></source>\n      </video><p> Animation has had a particularly strong year in 2013. Not only is the top title (so far) Despicable Me 2, there are two more animations – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155588/monsters-university\" title=\"\">Monsters University</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/151435/croods\" title=\"\">The Croods</a> – in the year's top 10, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150381/wreck-it-ralph\" title=\"\">Wreck-It Ralph</a> is just outside. Frozen should make a fifth animated feature at £20m-plus by year's end.</p><h2>The festive flop</h2><p>Generating a lot of publicity – much of it negative – surrounding the casting of Britain's Got Talent winner Susan Boyle, festive period tale <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/158849/christmas-candle\">The Christmas Candle</a> failed to engage cinema audiences in limited play. Released on a very modest 11 screens, the film achieved a gross of £7,747. Investors presumably hope the film will be a DVD gifting staple for older family members in years to come.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>Overall the box office is a slim 1% up on the equivalent weekend from 2012, when the original Hobbit film and DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians occupied the top two spots in the chart. This extends to four weeks a run where takings were up on the year-ago equivalent, following an eight-week run where box-office lagged behind 2012. Now cinema owners are hoping for a strong hold from both Smaug and Frozen, plus nice returns from the arrival on 18 December of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155772/anchorman\" title=\"\">Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</a>, followed on Friday by The Harry Hill Movie, Moshi Monsters and Walking with Dinosaurs.
