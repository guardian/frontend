He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for more general talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at \"some sort of political settlement that would deal with the underlying terrible conflict\".</p><p>In the same interview, Obama also urged Iran's leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis. He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear aspirations peacefully, but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>\"I think what the Iranians understand is that the nuclear issue is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that the threat against … Israel that a nuclear Iran poses is much closer to our core interests.

Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>With a new moderate and media-savvy Iranian leadership in place and a White House looking for a quick diplomatic victory, there is speculation about the prospect of a historic &quot;chance encounter&quot; in the corridors of the UN general assembly next week. There is talk that Barack Obama might shake hands with Iran&apos;s president, Hassan Rouhani, which would be the first direct encounter between US and Iranian leaders since Jimmy Carter and Shaha Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1977. Failing that, diplomats say that a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, could well be on the cards. That alone would be the highest-level exchange since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>&quot;Corridor diplomacy&quot;, or the fancy-meeting-you-here school of foreign policy, has a long if not a particularly proud history as a tool for statesmen and women who have not quite made up their minds whether they want to be seen together. That applies particularly to the always-tricky relationship between the US and Iran. The late US special envoy on Afghanistan, Richard Holbrooke, bumped into Iran&apos;s deputy foreign minister Mohammad-Mehdi Akhoondzadeh, at a conference on Afghanistan in The Hague in 2009. Holbrooke&apos;s boss at the time, Hillary Clinton, called it <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7975079.stm\" title=\"\">&quot;a cordial exchange&quot;</a> and said the two would stay in touch. But they did not. The time was definitely not ripe in Tehran and Akhoondzadeh spent much of his ensuing career back in Tehran trying to play it down, if not deny it altogether.</p> <p>The Hague incident was followed later that year by a &quot;sidebar&quot; meeting between US and Iranian diplomats at Geneva talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. The &quot;sidebar&quot; is a notch up on the corridor meeting. Chairs are usually provided, for example, and sometimes even a table, but the bottom line is that neither side is particularly committed to the outcome. As it turned out, that was the case in Geneva, and there has been no official contact between the two powers ever since.</p> <p>However, general assembly week at the UN, beginning next Monday, is an ever-fertile environment for such coy diplomatic trysts as the corridors are so crowded with world leaders it is sometimes difficult to avoid each other. Obama&apos;s security detail went out of its way to make sure he did not get cornered into a grip-and-grin with Rouhani&apos;s fiercely outspoken predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In a 2009 Summit of the Americas meeting in Trinidad and Tobago, the president was trapped into an involuntary handshake with another nemesis, Venezuela&apos;s Hugo Chávez. Chávez not only managed to sidle up to Obama but hand him a book, triggering much rightwing derision back in Washington. The cheeky publicity-hogging tactic subsequently became known as &quot;pulling a Chávez&quot;.</p> <p>Former British foreign secretary Jack Straw also found himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/28/zimbabwe.foreignpolicy\" title=\"\">unwittingly shaking the hand of an undesirable foreign leader</a>, in the shape of Robert Mugabe. Straw said later that it was an accident as he had been shaking lots of hands in a &quot;dark corner&quot; of the UN. But Gordon Brown suffered what is perhaps the opposite ignominy. In 2009, the then prime minister was desperate for some public face time with Obama. His team would have killed for some regular corridor diplomacy. Instead, the special relationship was relegated to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2009/09/obama_snub_deni.html\" title=\"\">a 15-minute &quot;walk and talk&quot;</a> out of sight in the UN&apos;s kitchens.</p> <p>It was a reminder that political opportunity is forever rubbing shoulders with the potential for humiliation in the teeming halls of global diplomacy.</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8080660","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-17T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"1966287","internalRevision":"1","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The UN general assembly often sees 'impromptu' meetings between leaders who would otherwise rather not be seen with each other.

Obama made a point of inviting Iranian involvement in international talks about a broader settlement to the Syrian conflict, something Washington had previously resisted.</p><p>Speaking on ABC News television, Obama revealed that he had exchanged letters on the Syrian crisis with Rouhani, a moderate elected in June, and raised the prospect of Iran participation in global diplomacy on Syria if Tehran recognised \"that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but destabilising the entire region\".</p><p>He said the Geneva deal could pave the way for talks involving Russia and Iran aimed at \"some sort of political settlement that would − deal with the underlying terrible conflict.\"</p><p>Rouhani is due to attend the United Nations general assembly next week, but it is not yet clear whether he will meet the US president there.</p><p>Britain's foreign office said on Sunday that the foreign secretary, William Hague, would meet his Iranian counterpart in New York, in what it called \"a positive step\" toward restoring full diplomatic ties between the two countries.</p><p>In the same interview, Obama also urged the Iranian leadership not to draw the wrong lessons from his decision to draw back from air strikes on Syria in pursuit of a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis. He said it showed that it was possible to resolve the stand-off over Iran's nuclear aspirations peacefully, but insisted it did not indicate a weakening of US resolve to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>\"I think what the Iranians understand is that – the nuclear issue – is a far larger issue for us than the chemical weapons issue, that – the threat against Iran – against Israel, that a nuclear Iran poses, is much closer to our core interests. That – a nuclear arms race in the region – is something that would be profoundly destabilising,\" the president said in an ABC interview recorded on Friday, before a final Syria deal with Russia was struck in Geneva.</p><p>\"My suspicion is that the Iranians recognise they shouldn't draw a lesson that we haven't struck to think we won't strike Iran,\" Obama said, in remarks that may also have been intended as a reassurance to Israel that US deterrence against any Iranian attempt to build nuclear weapons had not been weakened.</p><p>After a meeting with US secretary of state, John Kerry, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, stressed the same point.</p><p>\"The determination the international community shows regarding Syria will have a direct impact on the Syrian regime's patron Iran. Iran must understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said.</p><p>However, Obama also stressed that there was also a more optimistic message for Iran arising from the Syrian deal with Russia.</p><p>\"What they should draw from this lesson is that there is the potential of resolving these issues diplomatically,\" the president said.</p><p>\"You know, negotiations with the Iranians [are] always difficult. I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy. But you know, my view is that if you have both a credible threat of force, combined with a rigorous diplomatic effort ... you can you can strike a deal.\"</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8077329","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2013-09-16T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1965751","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"US president seeks to shore up US deterrence in the Middle East and warns action against Iranian nuclear programme","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Barack Obama warns Iran that US is still prepared to take military action","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Julian Borger","commentable":"false","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/15/1379265443890/Barack-Obama-shore-up-pot-003.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3tndg","wordcount":"611","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/15/1379265443890/Barack-Obama-shore-up-pot-003.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","newspaperPageNumber":"18","internalStoryPackageCode":"59636","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-18T17:32:38Z","standfirst":"US president seeks to shore up US deterrence in the Middle East and warns action against Iranian nuclear programme","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-10-04T14:14:06Z","internalContentCode":"417338714"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/15/barack-obama-warns-iran-us-military-action","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/15/barack-obama-warns-iran-us-military-action","sectionName":"US news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-417339035","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/15/1379265441367/Barack-Obama-shore-up-pot-001.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","source":"AP","altText":"Barack Obama shore up potency of US deterrence in Middle East","height":"54","credit":"AP","caption":"Obama said his administration's approach to Syria's chemical weapons should show Iran that there's the potential for diplomatic solutions to arms standoffs.

Within hours of the announcement, Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, announced she had contacted Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's new foreign minister, and agreed to meet on the sidelines of the UN meeting in New York later this month.</p><p>Ashton co-ordinates the '5+1' – the permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany –  who have been in largely fruitless talks with Iran over its nuclear programme for seven years. The last round was in Istanbul in May.</p><p>Iranian negotiators have been led since 2003 by the Secretary of the SNSC, at that time none other than Rouhani, who took Iran into two years of negotiations with the European Union during which Tehran suspended all uranium enrichment before a tentative, preliminary agreement broke down.</p><p>Rouhani's new move is partly to create a clearer decision-structure but also reflects his confidence in Zarif, who is US-educated as well as known to many US politicians, including vice-president Joe Biden, from his stint in New York from 2002 to 2007 as Iran's UN representative.</p><p>\"Having a new foreign minister, the first to be respected internationally in three decades, and also a quick decision-making process between him and the president, this is the only workable way to tackle the crippling nuclear crisis,\" said Kourosh Zaim, a leading member of the opposition National Front party in Tehran.</p><p>In the reformist press, Samira Farahbakhsh argued in Mardom Salaarie (Democracy) that Zarif was \"held in high esteem\" by western diplomats given his \"relatively comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of Western players\".</p><p>It has also been argued it was important for Rouhani to put talks under a diplomatic rather than a security rubric.</p><p>Iran Diplomacy, a website associated with Sadegh Kharrazi, former ambassador to both the UN and France, has posted an <a href=\"http://www.irdiplomacy.ir/fa/page/1921026/پایان+نگاه+امنیتی+به+مذاکرات+هسته+ای.html\">article</a> headlined The End of Viewing Nuclear Negotiations a Security Issue, suggesting the move \"tells foreigners that Iran has changed the character of the issue from one of security to diplomatic/political, and that they should reconsider their stance as well...[as understanding] the Iranian side is looking  for a win-win outcome\".</p><p>Kharrazi is close to Zarif, and the pair worked together closely on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/03/iran-nuclear-weapons\">2003 Grand Bargain offer to the United States</a>, an initiative ignored by the Bush administration.</p><p>The article reiterates Kharrazi's experience that Iran requires a positive response from Washington: \"Of course, the transfer of the dossier from SNSC to the foreign ministry doesn't necessarily suggest that Iran will step back from its [claim to] legal rights [for nuclear development under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty], or that this impasse will be resolved and overcome quickly. Resolution of such an impasse depends on the political will of all sides, and for as long as such a will doesn't exist, then the best decision-making systems and the most astute diplomats will produce nothing.\"</p><p>But domestically at least, Rouhani seems to have the momentum with him after his overwhelming presidential election victory in June. When he held talks with the Europeans between 2003 and 2005, Rouhani and his negotiating team were subject to stinging attacks in the conservative press. So far, as president Rouhani has experienced nothing of the sort.</p><p>In 2003-05 the Kayhan newspaper led the way with a series of critical editorials by Hossein Shariatmadari, who as editor-in-chief is an appointee of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In reacting to the transfer of the nuclear file to the foreign ministry, the paper has <a href=\"http://www.kayhan.ir/920616/2.htm#N203 \">simply noted the move</a>, offering no immediate analysis or opinion.<br /> <br />Similarly, Resalat, a daily close to the right-leaning Motalefeh (coalition) Party, has chosen silence.</p><p>Raja News, a website staunchly in support of the still SNSC secretary and defeated presidential candidate Saeed Jalili, has also been mute, prompting speculation in Tehran that Ayatollah Khamenei's office has advised editors not to criticise Rouhani at a delicate time in international affairs.</p><p>Not that the SNSC is entirely out of the picture.  In an interview with the semi-governmental Mehr News Agency, Zarif said talks would be carried out \"in consultations with the SNSC and other relevant organs\". Marzieh Afkham, the first female spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, has also spoken of \"necessary co-ordination\" with the SNSC.</p><p>One editor-in-chief of a reformist publication told Tehran Bureau he was sceptical about the whole move. \"It seems to me that decision-making will remain with the council,\" he said. \"The foreign affairs ministry can only execute the council's decisions. We have to see if the negotiation strategy will change, or just the faces of the negotiators.\"</p><p>But the editor did concede that Zarif is \"a truly powerful negotiator\".</p><p>Zaim, a long-term critic of the Iranian authorities, was even more optimistic in foreseeing a \"U-turn in IRI foreign diplomacy from hard-headedness and stupidity to some sort of wisdom\".</p><p>Zaim added that he hoped Rouhani and Zarif would be given room – at home and abroad – to find solutions. \"This turnabout of course is a good sign and we hope it will bear positive results provided the 5+1 also approach the upcoming negotiations with [an] intent to resolve the crisis,\" he said. \"I believe the Supreme Leader is taking a back seat in this process, because it is a do or die proposition.\" <br /> <br />A professor in Iran told Tehran Bureau he was delighted to see the end of Saeed Jalili's responsibility for handling the nuclear talks. \"He never learned anything about diplomatic protocols except for his mistimed and misplaced smiles. I can truly call Jalili the most incapable Iranian diplomat since the Qajar dynasty [1779-1924].\"</p><p>‎<em>Tehran Bureau's Nuclear Watch series monitors the way the Iranian media reports the country's nuclear programme</em></p>","productionOffice":"UK","showInRelatedContent":"true","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1964635","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"<p>Nuclear watch: Iranian president gives foreign affairs minister responsibility for negotiations with the west</p>","allowUgc":"false","lastModified":"2014-10-04T14:38:52Z","headline":"Iran's conservatives silent as Rouhani puts nuclear talks on diplomatic footing","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Tehran Bureau correspondent","commentable":"true","internalContentCode":"417150062"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/12/iran-nuclear-weapons-talks","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/sep/12/iran-nuclear-weapons-talks","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-417203441","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1379004955177/Irans-foreign-minister-Mo-008.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","source":"EPA","photographer":"SAAD SHALASH / POOL","altText":"Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif ","height":"276","credit":"SAAD SHALASH / POOL/EPA","caption":"Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, will be in charge of nuclear negotiations with the west.

Avoiding any pledge of specific support, he raised his palms in prayer, saying: \"I hope merciful God protects this region from the menace of America and Zionism and other evils.\"</p><p>Khamenei's silence about defending Assad was underscored by a subsequent report from the semi-official Fars news agency on a speech delivered by General Mohammad Ali Jafari, chief of the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. In extensive excerpts of his address to a conference of ground force commanders, there was not a single word about Syria.</p><p>A year ago, by contrast, Colonel Mohammad Ali Asoodi, the head of the guards' culture and propaganda office, said: \"If America attacks Syria, Iran, along with Syrian allies will go into action.\"</p><p>The tone of General Masoud Jazayeri, the deputy chief-of-staff of Iran's armed forces, took a particularly noticeable turn this week.</p><p>On Sunday, he had threatened: \"The United States is aware of the red zone of the Syrian front and any violation of the Syrian red line will have serious consequences for the White House,\" including revenge by multiple nations.</p><p>Three days later, however, he said little more than that an internationalised war would be a net loss to Israel. Like Khamenei, the only intervention he invoked was divine. \"God willing, the flames of this conflagration will set Zionism's robe ablaze,\" he said.</p><p>He refrained from making any threats towards the US, and settled for offering advice: \"The Americans should rid themselves of this arrogant self-assuredness and if they have any resources, spend them on saving the American people.\"</p><p>A Middle East analyst in Tehran said: \"It is evident that Khamenei is worried enough about his nuclear programme and isn't scrambling for a new headache for himself. He has also gotten this into the heads of his vociferous commanders, who love belligerent oration. Why? Because he has understood that this is not a joke anymore.\"</p><p>It is also likely that Iranian leaders see the sort of strike being mooted as no more than a rap on Assad's knuckles, rather than a step towards bringing down his government. Exercising restraint at this juncture will not only keep Iran from wading into an inferno, but will also maintain its ability to influence Syrian politics in the future.</p><p>That said, such restraint may pose its own problems as, according to many reports, Tehran and Damascus signed a mutual defence treaty in 2006. The Iranian student news agency (ISNA), however, recently quoted the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, as denying that any agreement of the sort existed.</p><p>One reformist political activist said: \"I have not heard Moallem's words, but it is clear that Tehran feels that the rumours of this hairy pact are now prickling its nose. Tehran is agitated over unconstrained actions carried out in Syria without co-ordination [with Iran]. I have no doubt Moallem has denied [the existence of] this defensive pact under pressure from Tehran.\"</p><p>Provocative declarations continue to appear in conservative media outlets, such as the influential Kayhan daily, edited by long-time regime insider Hossein Shariatmadari and widely thought to reflect Khamenei's views. In a Wednesday editorial headlined \"Day of Fate Is at Hand\", it welcomed a western attack on Syria with open arms: \"It's time to wonder if we should not take the probable idiocy of the US and its allies as a positive omen.\"</p><p>The paper suggested that western intervention would serve only to yield three results, each of benefit to Iran: hasten the collapse of the Saudi and Qatari regimes; incite the Syrian population to destroy the Salafist rebel forces; and unify the remaining Islamic factions in the war zone against the US and Israel.</p><p>Kayhan editorials have often been seen as testing the water for regime policies, but the editor-in-chief of a reformist publication said: \"Don't take Shariatmadari seriously any more. His perch has collapsed since the elections. No one pays attention or anything else to his words. Of course, he is Khamenei's proxy, but Khamenei has a thousand and one proxies all over the place and each one sings a different tune.\"</p><p>In the eyes of some commentators, recent events suggest that Rouhani and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have been able to get the upper hand in influencing the supreme leader. The lack of a vehement reaction from Tehran to the possibility of a strike on Syria could indicate that the regime is prepared to adopt a much more moderate approach to engagement with the west than was the case during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's eight years as president.</p><p>One Iranian analyst, who spoke on condition of full anonymity, holds a very different opinion. \"The Iranian establishment will stick to its guns,\" he said. \"Zarif and others may use a different, less confrontational tone than Ahmadinejad, but national interests are national interests. If they take Syria, Iran is next, from the Iranian perspective.</p><p>\"Iran hasn't been spending all these resources in Syria for nothing these past decades. Syria was a critical ally during the Iran-Iraq war. [Assad's father, Hafez] supported Iran against Saddam and kept Arab states from forming a united front against the newly formed Islamic Republic in the 1980s.</p><p>\"Even if the shah were in power, he would help [Syria]. It's a matter of national interest.\"</p>","internalOctopusCode":"8012379","productionOffice":"UK","hasStoryPackage":"true","internalPageCode":"1958223","publication":"theguardian.com","trailText":"Behind the more moderate rhetoric, however, some expect Tehran to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Damascus if the latter is attacked","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Iran's reaction to possible US attack on Syria shows signs of restraint","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","byline":"Tehran Bureau correspondent","commentable":"true","secureThumbnail":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/30/1377865402768/Ayatollah-Ali-Khamenei-005.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/3td4y","wordcount":"999","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/30/1377865402768/Ayatollah-Ali-Khamenei-005.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalStoryPackageCode":"59636","commentCloseDate":"2013-09-06T12:23:47Z","standfirst":"Behind more moderate rhetoric, some still expect Tehran to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Damascus if latter is attacked","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2014-10-04T14:38:38Z","internalContentCode":"416160131"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/aug/30/iran-us-attack-syria-restraint","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/world/iran-blog/2013/aug/30/iran-us-attack-syria-restraint","sectionName":"World news","elements":[{"id":"gu-image-416161056","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/30/1377865399544/Ayatollah-Ali-Khamenei-002.jpg","typeData":{"displayCredit":"true","source":"AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei","height":"54","credit":"AFP/Getty Images","caption":"Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has expressed Iran's kinship with Syria but stopped short of saying Tehran would come to Bashar al-Assad's defence.
