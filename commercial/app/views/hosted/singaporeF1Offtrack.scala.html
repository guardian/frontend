    </a>
    for the must do's!
</p>
<h2>
    1) Bay Grandstand (included)
</h2>
<p>
    Zone access: 3, 4
</p>
<p>
    All packages purchased from <a href="https://sianightrace.com/f1-deals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" data-link-name="sianightrace.com">sianightrace.com</a>
    include 3-Day access to the Bay Grandstand in Zones 3 and 4.
    Spectators at the Bay Grandstand get a panoramic view of the Marina Bay skyline.
    Because this section of track requires the drivers to negotiate four angled turns (16 to 19) in quick succession,
    it has proven to be an Achilles' heel for many of them, so expect to see plenty of action.
</p>
<h2>
    2) Premier Walkabout (top up from SGD 242)
</h2>
<p>
    Zone access: 1, 2, 3, 4
</p>
<p>
    If you are coming for all three days and like a bit of variety, consider a Premier Walkabout ticket.
    This allows you to move around and witness the action from special bleachers or stands at the side of the track.
    A good one is Esplanade Drive and Raffles Avenue, which is around Turn 14 on the race track.
    Alternatively head to Turn 3 at the top end of the track, where you can watch the cars join the pack as they exit the Pit Lane.
</p>
<h2>
 3) Singapore Airlines Lounge&#64;Turn 3 Hospitality Suite (top up from SGD 3,157) 
</h2>
<p>
    Zone access: 1, 2, 3, 4  
</p>
<p>
    Feast your eyes on prime views of the race, enjoyed in maximum comfort, with this ticket.
    You'll get the best of both worlds: a luxurious respite from the bustle of the race,
    plus unrivalled view of cars braking to 80km/h as they tackle the turn, before going full throttle down Republic Boulevard.
    Ticket-holders can indulge in a free flow of premium food and an open bar with wine,
    beers and soft drinks in air-conditioned comfort between races, or head outdoors to the Turn 3 Premier Grandstand
    to enjoy assigned seating with wider cushioned seats.

    What the locals say…
</h2>

<p>
    The top 10 places to eat and drink while you're here, as picked by Singaporeans
</p>
<p>
    'For the Grand Prix, you'll want a bar with a view. Try 1-Altitude on level 63 of One Raffles Place,

    or Ce La Vi at the top of Marina Bay Sands (the cocktails will wow you, as will the cityscapes).'
</p>
<p>
    'My favourite cafe in Singapore is Tiong Bahru Bakery at Eng Hoon Street, which serves lovely

    pastries and coffee. It's in a cool, retro-style neighbourhood, with distinctive 1950s low-rise

    buildings.'

</p>
<p>

    '28 HongKong Street is an award-winning, speakeasy-style bar with delicious cocktails. Try one of

    the special punches or a tipple that features American spirits and nods to prohibition.'

</p>
<p>

    'Also on HongKong Street, FOC Restaurant is a sophisticated tapas joint from acclaimed chef

    Nandu Jubany, who previously earned a Michelin star at his restaurant in Spain.'

</p>
<p>

    'Amoy Street is really cool for bars and restaurants. Bochinche, an Argentinean canteen-style

    restaurant serves awesome brunch options – don't miss the French toast with house-cooked ham

    and bacon ice-cream. Employees Only, sister to the famous NYC bar, offers up reliably impressive

    cocktails: try an EO Gimlet, made with Perry&#39;s Tot Navy Strength gin and lime cordial, or a Ready

    Aim Fire: a muddle of mezcal, lime juice, honey-pineapple syrup and Hellfire Bitters. Nibble on

    some bone marrow poppers if you get peckish.'

</p>

    lightboxIndex = None,
    widthsByBreakpoint = ImageContentMedia.inline
)
<br/>

<p>

    'Just over in Duxton, Lucha Loco is a really fun Mexican place that serves delicious food and

    drinks. If you've got a soft spot for tequila and tacos, this is your place.'

</p>
<p>

    'Moosehead Kitchen-Bar does some amazing food and drinks on Telok Ayer Street. It's run by a

    Greek-Aussie father-son team and has a relaxed vibe and a deceptively simple menu – from the

    grilled meats to the incredibly tasty vegetarian dishes, everything's packed with flavour.'

</p>
<p>

    'My favourite cocktail bar is Bar Stories on Haji Lane, Singapore's hipster street. Instead of a

    menu, the mixologists ask you what kind of flavours you like – they're super creative. We asked for

    a bunch of fiery drinks one night because we just wanted to see stuff set on fire: they set each of

    our cocktails on fire in different ways. They're cool staff, not pretentious, and they want to have fun

    with it, but the cocktails stand up to the hype – they're excellent!'

</p>
<p>

    'There's a nice little Japanese-style rooftop bar next to the Fullerton Bay Hotel called Kinki.

    Freshness is key here: expect succulent sushi and sashimi, alongside hot and cold mains, plus

    exotic drinks. There's an extensive sake selection, but I love the peach blossom margarita –

    especially on a balmy Singaporean evening.'

</p>
<p>

    'The Fullerton Bay Hotel's roof is a great spot for Marina Bay views. Stake out seats at the Lantern

    Rooftop Bay bar and survey the city as you sip on kumquat and cardamom cocktails.'
