    Another great option is to combine your visit with a side trip. Singapore Airlines and Trailfinders
    have teamed up to offer some dual-destination F1 packages – pick from Singapore and Phuket,
    Singapore and Borneo, or Singapore and Sydney. Wherever you decide to go, you can take
    advantage of big savings; there are also slashed-price flights just to Singapore, if you’ve got a one-
    track mind.
</p>
<p>
    Why not treat yourself to a Business Class package? Prices start from £4,199 for an 11-night, twin-
    centre package combining Singapore and Thailand. Economy Class packages start from just
    £1,699 for a 10-night package combining Singapore and Bali.
