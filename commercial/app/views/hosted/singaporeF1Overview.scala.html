<h2>
    Friday 16 September:
</h2>

<p class="text">
    During the two sessions of Free Practice, the teams check out the track

    and evaluate how their cars behave in current set-up. Strategy for the race will be planned based

    on the information gained, such as the settings for the aerodynamics, how long each type of tyre

    will last (teams have to use two different types of Pirelli tyre during a race – one harder than the

    other – which adds a tactical element to the race) and therefore when to make their pit-stops.

    Music:
</h2>

<p class="text">
    Australian singing sensation Kylie Minogue opens the festivities on the Padang Stage

    (Zone 4). American disco kings KC and the Sunshine Band perform at the Espanade Outdoor Theatre (Zone 4).
</p>

<h2>
    Saturday 17 September:
</h2>

<p class="text">
    Qualifying is where the drivers try to set the fastest single lap time

    possible to determine in which position they will start the race. After the first 18-minute session, the

    slowest six drivers will be eliminated; they will start at the back of the grid in the order of their best

    lap time. The second 15-minute session will see the remaining 16 drivers reduced to 10, who will

    then go on to a 10-minute final &#39;shoot out&#39; to determine their starting positions and, of course,

    decide who will secure the all-important Pole Position.
</p>

<h2>
    Music:
</h2>

<p class="text">
    Multi-award-winning English indie rock band Bastille will perform, followed by Queen +

    Adam Lambert at the Padang Stage (Zone 4), while KC and The Sunshine Band will perform their

    disco hits at the Village Stage (Zone 1). Grammy-winning American a cappella group

    Pentatonix will be live at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre (Zone 4).

    Five to try: essential items for your tourist checklist
</h2>

<p class="text">
    See Singapore in style, during the GP
</p>
<p class="text">

    1) Get an aerial view of the Marina Bay Street Circuit from the Singapore Flyer, a 165-metre

    observation wheel – the largest in Asia (and the second largest in the world). 2016 Formula 1

    Singapore Airlines Grand Prix Zone 1 ticketholders enjoy free rides on the observation wheel over

    the race weekend.
</p>
<p class="text">
    2) Enjoy a Singapore Sling where it was first created – in the Long Bar of the iconic Raffles Hotel –

    and throw your peanut shells on the floor (the only place in super-clean Singapore where &#39;littering&#39;

    is permitted)
</p>
<p class="text">
    3) Ride the tram or take a stroll in one of the trails at the Night Safari, the world&#39;s first nocturnal zoo
</p>
<p class="text">
    4) Escape the noise of the F1 action by taking a bus or cable car to Sentosa, where you can go

    back in time at the Images of Singapore LIVE, located at the Imbiah Lookout, and see what life

    was like during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in WWII. If you are feeling adventurous, visit

    the Universal Studios theme park and check out the adrenalin-pumping roller coaster rides. For

    those seeking a more relaxed experience, take pictures with the towering Merlion (the mythical

    creature that is the symbol of Singapore) or just kick up your feet and just relax on one of the

    beaches on this island.
</p>
<p class="text">
    5) Get your retail kicks on charmingly narrow Haji Lane, which is lined with former 19th-century

    shophouses that have been transformed into fashionable and eclectic boutiques
