During this class, you’ll examine the poetics, imagery and structure of these two dramatic tales, set during and after the Trojan War. You’ll learn how they informed subsequent Greek literature – including the great Greek tragedies and the lyric outpourings of Sappho, one of the few known female poets of the ancient world. Plus, you’ll discover how Homer’s work continues to inspire writing in the present day, from Michael Longley to Alice Oswald and Margaret Atwood. \nCharlotte is one of the UK’s best-known writers and classicists. She’s the Guardian’s chief culture writer and has written numerous books including It’s All Greek to Me, which brings the history of ancient Greece to life. If you wish you’d studied the Classics at school, or want to reignite your passion for the subject, don’t miss out on this fascinating masterclass. Book your place now and let Charlotte reawaken your interest in the ancient world – and the ways it continues to inform the present. \nMore about your teacher... \nCharlotte Higgins is the chief culture writer of the Guardian and a member of its editorial board. A classicist by education, she has written three books on aspects of the ancient world. The most recent, Under Another Sky: Journeys in Roman Britain, was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson prize for non-fiction.

It’s also one of the most complex. With 14 Republican candidates and three Democrats in line for the presidency, it can be difficult to keep track of it all. \nDuring this evening masterclass, the Guardian’s editor-at-large, Gary Younge, will discuss the key things you need to know about the upcoming election. You’ll receive an overview of the electoral landscape and the key issues at stake. Plus, you’ll deepen your understanding of the key candidates in the race – from Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, to Republican hopefuls such as Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.  \nAt the time of the masterclass, Gary will have just returned to the UK after reporting on the US primaries for a month. Don’t miss out on an incredible learning experience at the Guardian, book your place now and spend the evening learning how things are likely to play out in November 2016 – and why.  \nMore about your teacher…  \nGary Younge is the Guardian’s editor-at-large, and an award-winning journalist who has covered US politics for 12 years. He also writes a monthly column for the Nation magazine, and is the author of several books including The Speech: The Story Behind Martin Luther King’s Dream and Who Are We – And Should It Matter in the 21st Century?.
