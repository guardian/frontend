# **The different applications composing the Guardian website**

The Guardian frontend is a set of Play Framework 2 Scala applications.

A Nginx **router** sits in front of all the applications and dispatches requests to the appropriate service based on the requested path.

# Facia-Press
Facia-press's only task is to press fronts.
_Pressing a front means creating a json representation of the front content and storing it in a S3 bucket for further use by the Facia app._

Since a front page is made up of one or more pieces of content, to render a page efficiently the system reads the cached output of Facia-press to drastically improve the render time of Facia. Without Facia-Press, the Facia server would have to lookup many content IDs from Content API, causing a large amount of work to be done on Facia itself, giving the server group poor performance under load, and breaking the golden response time rule (respond in under 2000ms).

Pressing happens automatically as the Facia-Press app listens to a job queue and responds to pressing requests as they occurs.

Pressing tasks are also scheduled via a cron job to be triggered on a regular basis.

It is also possible to run a pressing task by manually sending a request to one of the supported endpoints.

# Archive
In case none of the other apps can serve a given request, it is finally passed to the Archive app which checks if there is any redirect setup for this url or any old static content attached to it.

If yes the Archive app returns this old static content or redirect, otherwise a 404 is eventually served to the client.

Diagnostics app is used internally to gather data and analytics from the Guardian frontend client side.
