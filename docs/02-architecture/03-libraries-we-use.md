# Libraries we use
If you are developing something and haven't got a clue where to start, some of this might be good pointers.
## front end

### Node dependencies
We also have a set of Node dependencies, used mostly by our static asset pipeline. We use `yarn` to manage these.

When you want to add or update a dependency:

```
yarn add <package>@<version>
```
