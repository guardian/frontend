# Fronts Architecture

![Fronts architecture](/docs/images/fronts-archirecture.png)

The goal of the Fronts architecture is the production of aggregation files (`pressed.json`, one for each front) containing all the structured content required by each front. Each `pressed.json` file is a complete snapshot of the ContentApi data, override data, and configuration metdata for every article and collection on its respective front; each serves as the single blocking call - made by the Facia app - to service a request for that front.

The global list of defined fronts - and the definitions of the collections on those fronts - is held in a single configuration file (`config.json`). This file is edited using the Configuration Editor. It is polled and referred to by each component in the architecture. 

The running order of articles in each collection - and various tweaks to those articles - are represented in multiple `collection.json` files. These are individually edited using the Fronts Editor. These `collection.json` files dictate which articles need to be requested from the ContentApi during the production of each front's `pressed.json` files.

As soon as an individual collection is edited, the Presser re-creates a `pressed.json` file for each front containing that collection. Additionally, every front is periodically queued for re-pressing. The `pressed.json` files - one for each front - are stored on S3. Both preview and live versions are produced.

## Service Level Metrics & Alerts

A large number of ContentApi requests are made in order to produce each front's `pressed.json` file. Due to this dependency, the Presser is the point in the architecture that has the most potential for failure. The metrics and alerts relate principally to its ongoing ability to produce `pressed.json` files.

Some of the metrics are to designed to identify terminally unhealthy processes. Others are informational and indicate problems in the broader network (notably ContentApi). Others monitor the speed at which updates travel through the architecture.

### Succesive press failures - MANUAL presser (facia-tool)

* __Detail__ : immediately after a collection is edited within the Fronts Editor, the Presser is invoked to re-create the `pressed.json` files for any front containing that collection.

* __Metrics__  : if the number of *consecutive* failures of the Presser to produce `pressed.json` files exceeds N, the healthcheck fails. The failure count is reset by any successful pressing. 

* __Consequence__ : Instance terminates.

### Succesive press failures - CRON presser (facia-press)

* __Detail__ : every three minutes, the Admin app puts the ids of every front on an SQS queue. These are pulled in bunches (of up to 10) every 10 seconds by Presser instances, and `pressed.json` files are re-created for each front.

* __Metrics__  : if the number of *consecutive* failures of the Presser to produce `pressed.json` files exceeds N, the healthcheck fails. The failure count is reset by any successful pressing. 

* __Consequence__ : Instance terminates.

### Statictical press failures - CRON presser (facia-press)

* __Detail__ : due to momentary ContentApi unavailability or increased latency somewhere in the network - pressing will on occasion fail. Above a certain frequency, these failures should be considered as indicative of a operational issue.   

* __Metrics__  : 50 failures within 15 minutes, monitored in CloudWatch.

* __Consequence__ : PagerDuty alarm

### Statictical press failures - MANUAL presser (facia-tool)

* __Detail__ : due to momentary ContentApi unavailability or increased latency somewhere in the network - pressing will on occasion fail. Above a certain frequency, these failures should be considered as indicative of a operational issue.   

* __Metrics__  : 50 failures within 15 minutes, monitored in CloudWatch. 

* __Consequence__ : PagerDuty alarm

### ContentAPI invalid responses

* __Detail__ : the Presser (and also the fronts tools) are dependent on ContentApi results being well-formed. Occasionally ContentApi returns intermittently malformed results.

* __Metrics__  : (a) 50 malformed results within 15 minutes, monitored in CloudWatch; (b) a single malformed result monitored by the facia-tool UI.

* __Consequence__ : (a) PagerDuty alarm; (b) a "red" alert in the UI with an option to "try again".

### On edit, press within 10 seconds (not incl. cache time)

* __Detail__ : The end-to-end process from invoking the Presser to producing a `pressed.json` file - after a collection is manually edited - should be under 10 seconds. (It typically takes about 3 seconds under normal network conditions.)

* __Metric__  : the difference between the most recent timestamp of a front's various `collection.json` files, and the timestamp of that front's `pressed.json` file. This is checked 10 seconds after any edit; the result itself should be below 10 seconds.

* __Consequence__ : if the metric exceeds 10 seconds, an "orange" alert appears in the tool UI with an option to "try again". The condition occurs on occasion due to momentary high latency somewhere in network, and generally does not reproduce itself on retry.
