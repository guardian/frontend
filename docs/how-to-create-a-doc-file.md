# META: How to create a new documentation file

## Documentation conventions

- Find the correct subdirectory your new documentation file belongs to.
- Every documentation file should be markdown (with .md extension).
- First line of every documentation file should contain its title (used to generated the table of content).
- Store all the images in an `/images` subfolder in the same directory the document referencing them will be.
- Table of content (TOC) is generated automatically with every commit, all changes will be staged accordingly.
