## Documentation conventions

- Find the correct subdirectory your new documentation file belongs to.
- Every documentation file should be markdown (with .md extension).
- First line of every documentation file should contain its title (used to generated the table of content).
- Table of content (TOC) is generated automatically with every commit, all changes will be staged accordingly.
