What is this?
-------------

This directory is a holding pen for features we've written together, nominally in the Gherkin format.

During development the features are translated in to scalatest's BDD GivenWhenThen vocabulary and, once pushed to master, can be viewed in Team City,

- http://teamcity.gudev.gnl:8111/repository/download/bt651/.lastSuccessful/features.zip

Once the feature has been delivered we can remove the feature files from this directory.
