# Bad advert JS code

 * date: 2013-03-28
 * duration: ~2 hours
 * environment: PROD

## Summary

At ~4pm, Matt C. noticed a dramatic rise in our [JS errors graph](http://graphite.guprod.gnl/render/?width=586&height=308&_salt=1364896453.058&target=ganglia.GU-PROD-Frontend.frontend-diagnostics_eu-west-1.__SummaryInfo__.gu_ads_diagnostics_rate-frontend-diagnostics.sum&yMax=&from=15%3A00_20130328&until=16%3A30_20130328)

Tailing the diagnostic box's access logs, there appear to be an increase in errors of the form

```
SyntaxError%3A%20Expected%20an%20identifier%20but%20found%20'ca'%20instead&filename=undefined&lineno=2
```

and

```
/px.gif?js/message=Uncaught%20SyntaxError%3A%20Unexpected%20identifier&filename=http%3A%2F%2Fm.guardian.co.uk%2F&lineno=3
```

Grepping the previous hour's log, these errors were not appearing.

Running the app on dev, and after a bit of haystack searching amongst the minified js code, narrowed the error down to some badly formatted code within the adstream js.

```
…
if (position == 'Bottom2') {
    document.write ('"<script type=""text/javascript""><!--\n');
    document.write ('google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-2012933198307164"";\n');
    document.write ('/* UK_mobile_bottom */\n');
    document.write ('google_ad_slot = ""3890571450"";\n');
    document.write ('google_ad_width = 320;\n');
    document.write ('google_ad_height = 50;\n');
    document.write ('//-->\n');
    document.write ('</script>\n');
    document.write ('<script type=""text/javascript""\n');
    document.write ('src="http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_mjx.ads/m.guardian.co.uk/m…E013465&a=E013610&a=E013634&a=E010677&a=E00&callback=reqwest_1364490293637"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"">\n');
    document.write ('</script>"');
}
…
```

Note the over-abundance of double quotes

Rez Haque was emailed at 5.35pm and responded half an hour later that AdOps had cleaned up the code.

## Impact

Visually, users were seeing a single double-quote in the space where the ad should have been.

Behind the scenes, our js error graph shot up 5-fold the normal traffic.

## Thoughts

 * Not a major end-user issue, though did impact ad revenue briefly.
 * Process of adding advert code seems error-prone (manual copy/paste process) and lacks QA.
 * It is fiddly to diagnose locally with a minified js file.
 
## Actions
  
 * We really need threshold/rate-of-change monitoring on the ganglia graphs to help awareness of errors.
 * Turn off minification on dev ([issue 569](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/issues/569))
