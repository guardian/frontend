# Lots of 404 pages being served

- date: Starting 3.40pm 2013-01-10
- duration: 2 hours 
- environment: PROD

## Summary

Starting about 3.40pm Content API reported lots of extra 404 pages being served on /null.
Likewise we had noticed extra 404 pages being served by the application.

Inspecting the logs from the router showed that this was happening exclusively on
m.guardiannews.com where we were getting calls that looked like /world/2013/jan/10/null.

Since it was exclusively on m.guardiannews.com and there had been no recent deploys it
was hypothesised that the incident had been triggered by a US specific ad. This was confirmed
and the specific AD was identified by working with Ad Ops and using a US proxy.

This was not directly affecting site performance and since the cause was understood the
decision was taken to do nothing further (basically to let Ad Ops follow up on it)

## Thoughts 

* Users are unlikely to have noticed anything at all.
* It is unlikely that this would qualify as an out of hours fix issue.

## Actions

* There is no alerting that will warn us for a sudden surge in 404s, it might be worth thinking
about putting one in place.
