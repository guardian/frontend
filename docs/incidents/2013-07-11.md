# Frontend incident report - 11/07/2013

## Date
11th July 2013 from 12:00 -> 14:30 (intermittent, not all the time)

## Summary
At about 11am a new version of the software was deployed to production. A short while later the site started serving
stale content and the backends were reported as unhealthy. This was noticed very quickly as the developer was watching
 the deploy. The software was quickly rolled back and the site was running properly again within about 5 minutes.

The issue was diagnosed as a healthcheck problem and it took about 1.5 hours to get a new deploy out with the fixed
  healthcheck (see Lessons learned).

Shortly after deploy there was another short period of downtime and the software was rolled back again. Once again the
site was serving stale. The problem was diagnosed as a different healthcheck.

## Effect on end users
Some end users got error pages for a short period of time (maybe about 1/6)(see screenshot)

## Lessons to be learned.
We have 3 layers of healthchecks, instance ELB, router ELB and Fastly. Always remember this.

When you are not immediately sure what exactly is wrong, rolling back the entire stack feels like a big job
(fortunately it did not come to that, but there was a moment of worry)

Another developer merged to MASTER while this was ongoing and triggered a round of builds and automated deploys that
caused long delays in solving the problem (some of the deploys to CODE failed).

Serve stale on error on Fastly does work (see screenshot)(it is the first time it has been invoked).

## Actions
GK to run through the merge to prod deploy principles with team again, this is a good example of why we have them.
