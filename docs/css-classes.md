# Conventions we use for CSS classes
We use [BEM](https://bem.info/)

## Further explanation of prefixes we use
- js-  - use only in JS to find elements, and never use for styling
- u-  are utilities e.g. u-h for display:none - these are defined by their behaviour rather than their meaning for these common cases.
- fc-  is for facia cards
