# Most Popular trailblock has links to the most popular articles that were read by visitors referred from Facebook


## Hypothesis

## Buckets

- Variant A: Viewing the section Most Popular trailblock (25%)
- Variant B: Viewing the global Most Popular trailblock (25%)
- Variant C: Viewing the Most Popular trailblock according to visitors referred from Facebook where there's nothing to indicate that the Most Popular list is different (25%)
- Variant D: Viewing the Most Popular trailblock according to visitors referred from Facebook, where the trailblock is labelled as 'Most Popular from Facebook' (25%)
