# Cards to linked content

## Hypothesis

People who are presented with inline links to Guardian content
as cards in the left sidebar will read more linked content.

Update 2013-08-20: cards are improved, we now show the type of content
it is linking to (comment, gallery, video). As a result we extend the test
to the end of September.

## Buckets

- Variant A: Viewing the original (50%)
- Variant B: Viewing linked content as cards in sidebar (50%)
