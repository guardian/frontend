# Truncate live blogs and show "read more" call-to-action

## Hypothesis

This truncates live blogs to only display the latest 10 blocks on page load, the users is then presented with a call-to-action to load more blocks if they wish.

This will increase users perception of easy-to-read content, and increase clicks through to onward journeys by presenting that content sooner.

However, this may drive down the dwell time on page.
