# Hypothesis

Adding call-to-actions for swipe functionality will increase discoverability of the functionality and thus increase
 overall page views per session.

# Buckets

- Control: Swipe with no call-to-actions (33%)
- Variant A: Swipe with "ears" fixed to the left and right of the screen (33%)
- Variant B: Swipe with a "bar" fixed to the top of the screen including page count and progress (33%)

# Predictions

## Jim & Nick

- Users that use swipe functionality increase from 2 -> 4%.

## Patrick

- Average page views per session increase by 1 with variant A (ears).
- Average page views per session increase by 2 with variant B (bar).
