# Hypothesis

People who use the lightbox consume more of our photographs.

# Buckets

- Control: Viewing the original galleries (33%)
- Variant A: Viewing pictures in the lightbox - swipe (33%)
- Variant B: Viewing pictures in the lightbox - no swipe (33%)

# Predictions

## Chris

- Number of photographs seen increases by 10% without swipe.
- Number of photographs seen increases by 10% with swipe.

## Jim

- Number of photographs seen increases by 5% without swipe.
- Number of photographs seen increases by 13% with swipe.

# Summary
The results of the test showed that people with lightboxed gallery trails were more engaged and increased average number of photographs viewed by ~10-15%.
There was no clear difference in numbers between users with or without swipe.

The decision has been made to include the feature permanently with the ability to both click and swipe.
