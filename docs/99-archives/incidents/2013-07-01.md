# Frontend incident report - 1/07/13

## Front and article server outage
Date 1st July 2013 from 13:16 -> 14:10

## Summary
At about 13:20 the first responders (DV & PH) noticed a 80% drop in 200 response codes on the front and articles servers. There was no spike in traffic before the incident but it did result in a 30% drop in overall traffic during the period.

There had been no deploys to production over the last 3 days so initial thoughts it may have been a network issue or CDN fault. Level3 and Amazon status pages were both showing green and the content api was independently checked, but appeared to be responding normally.

This the led us to believe it was content related, DOC ssh'd onto the front boxes and tailed the log's to find a high number of 503 errors coming from a helper class we use to generate image URI's. The code did not defend against content url strings with spaces and thus was exploding. A bit of content that had been updated onto the fronts with a new image that contained whitespace in its path.

It was decided to fix the bit of content instantly within the R2 admin tool, and then roll out a permanent fix once proven to work.

The re-launched content caused the front and article boxes to come back into service within 2 minutes of the change.

## Effect on end users
During the incident there was a drop of about 20% in traffic (see attached Ophan graph), articles were still being served stale (with the odd refresh from a working box).

## Actions
- As the boxes were responding quickly we were not notified by PageDuty or CloudWatch. An alert should be set up to monitor 500's over a certain threshold and time period.
- Trim all url paths supplied by the content API to avoid the underlying issue in the future. GK fixed this with this [commit](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/commit/bbad0a7eaf1db7e37b0fc5bf7d611d9a378875d8)
