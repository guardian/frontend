# Front application server failing to serve pages

- date: 2012-11-06
- duration: 30 minutes
- environment: CODE

## Summary

During security testing a line of malformed JavaScript code was
injected in to one of the fields of the trailblock admin tool
resulting this code being directly rendered on the network front.

The resulting HTML caused Play to throw compilation errors while
attempting to compress the malformed inline JS code.

The problem was repaired by copying a good configuration file (from
PROD) over the top of the bad one in the _frontend-store_ S3 bucket. 

## Thoughts

- The attack was fairly spurious and unlikely to occur in reality.
- Diagnosis was fairly swift, after isolating the front app server the
  application logs showed the compilation error, which lead to us
  locating the offending html document.
- The bugs was replicable on a local instance, which was useful. 
- We could tighten up the validation of the data before it's stored, or
  at least escaping the data before rendering. I.e. we trust the data,
  which is a sin given the consequence.
- The malformed JavaScript also broke the admin tool, meaning we
  couldn't repair the error using the tool that caused it. 

## Actions
  
-  Issues resolved assorted tickets.
