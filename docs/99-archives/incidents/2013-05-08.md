# Article server outage

- date: 8 May 2013 about 14:35 -> 16:45

## Changes to the system

There had been article deploys at 9:48 and 11:37  and provisioning at 11:29 and 11:37

## Summary

At about 14:35 we got Gomez and Pagerduty alerts for slow response times on the Article server.

There was no spike in hits on the servers (we normally see a spike in hits prior to an increase in latency)

The first responders (GK & PH) noticed that the autoscaling group had failed to automatically double the number of
instances.

Instance numbers were manually doubled, but they very soon dropped out of service with failing healthchecks.

The content api was independently checked, but appeared to be responding normally.

One of the changes that had gone out the morning (9:48) was a change to article parallelism
(https://github.com/guardian/frontend/pull/819). That was an obvious candidate, but was ruled out by rolling back to a
previous version of the article server (and still getting the same problem).

Other things that bore no fruit in diagnosis were..

- JStack
- Heap dump
- Logs (healthchecks could be seen failing, but the stack traces were not useful)
- AWS status board showed everything healthy

At about 16:45 the instances were doubled again (this had been attempted a number of times) and they slowly came back
online.

## Effect on end users

During the incident there was a drop of about 20% in traffic (see attached Ophan graph), articles were still being
served stale (with the odd refresh from a working box)

## Actions

It is possible that "thrashing" caused the boxes to continually die. The last attempt at increasing the autoscaling
group size was up to 16. It might be worth keeping that in mind in the future (this has not been an issue with articles
before, but has happened on the image servers).

## Exaltations

One of the devs (DOC) solved this sorry whole mess by simply showing up at the desk.

He shall henceforth be known as "The Bringer of Cooling Rain"
