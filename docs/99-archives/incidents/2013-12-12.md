# Omntiture tracking errors

- Start: 9 December 2013
- End: 12 December 2013
- duration: 4 Days
- environment: PROD

## Summary
A refactor of our entire multi-variant testing framework introduced a bug which could potentially throw a JavaScript runtime error resulting the Omniture tracking pixel not to be fired.

The bug was isolated to a very small proportion of users, 
whereby if a user had participated in an expired test that *had not* had it's correlating switch removed the framework would bomb out and throw an error.

As the issue only affected small percentage of our daily users the issue did not cause any of our major alerting systems to report, it was only until Steven Web (in house data analyst) was running a report on our site that the issue was noticed, 4 days after the malicious code was released. 

## Resolution
As we had observed this exact bug in the past we were instantly able to diagnose the issue - once reported - and a release was rolled out to PROD within one hour. See pull request: https://github.com/guardian/frontend/pull/2549 for further info.

The hot fix was to remove all orphaned switches from the frontend repo. This change was effective within an hour.

To prevent this occurring again, we extended the clean-up method inside the test framework to remove any participations which did not appear within the JavaScript test Array at the top of the file. See pull request https://github.com/guardian/frontend/pull/2556 for further details.

## User-facing consequences
As the Omniture tracking code runs very late in the JavaScript applications procedure, there was little to none user facing issues on the site.

## Thoughts

- Due to the desire for accurate reporting there is still a tight coupling between the AB framework and our Omniture tracking.
- Due to daily fluctuations in traffic, setting alerts on threshold change will be tricky.
- This reveals a weakness in our AB framework unit tests

## Actions

- We need to prevent this specific switch related bug from manifesting itself again. RN - DONE
- Review unit test coverage of JavaScript AB test framework. RN - TODO.
- Create a control tracking pixel non-dependant of JavaScript that is logged outside of Ophan and Omniture. This can then be used as a baseline in the future. GK - DONE
- Graph Ophan, Omniture and OAS page impressions in CloudWatch so frontend team can create alerts around threshold changes. GK - TODO
- We need to notify the whole technical team when something like this happens, as the information came in dribs and drabs.
