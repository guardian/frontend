# Downtime during royal birth live blog

## Date
22nd July 2013 from 20:30 -> 21:10  (downtime around 21:52 - 21:05)

## Summary
At about 20:30 the mobile site started receiving increased traffic due to the imminent 
official notice of the royal birth.

The traffic peaked at about 12,000 requests per minute somewhere around 19:47 and then started to fall 
off drastically, users getting the live blog of the event were seeing 503 error pages.

The system stabilised itself and was serving normally again at about 21:10.


## Diagnosis
Due to easy access to dashboards it was quickly realised that the issue was due to a slowdown in the content api. It was
taking up to 10 seconds to return queries and connections were timing out.

The number of Article servers was scaled up, however in this case (slow content api) that did not help (it did not hurt either).

Further analysis by the Content team revealed that clients (including this team) are still using the 'showMedia()' 
query which is very expensive and especially so in this case where the article had a lot of media.

Despite the content-api royal birth queries timing out, the backend reported healthy. This is because the content api was still responsive on most other requests, and the healthchecks passed.

The CDN served stale, but because the backend was not reported as unhealthy, it only did so for 60 seconds.

## Effect on end users
Users trying to access the live blog were timing out and seeing a 503 error page.

## Lessons to be learned/ Actions.
The normal case of 60 seconds stale is not enough, this has been upped to 30 minutes.

All qeueries will be switched to use 'showElements()' instead of 'showMedia()'.
