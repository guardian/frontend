# Recipe for Breton crêpes

Quantities are in metric system, because science.

## Ingredients

- 250 g plain flour
- a bit of buckwheat flour (aka farine de blé noir / sarazin in French stores)
- 100 g sugar
- a pinch of salt
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 l of milk (a pint, for you bloody Brits)

## Steps

### The batter

- Put the flour, sugar and salt in a bowl. Mix it with a manual whisk
  (not an electric one)
- Arrange the mix as if a sort of pit had been dug
- Put the eggs in the pit
- Stir from the inside, to the edges of the pit (this part is important),
  taking a little bit of the mix off of the edges of the bowl at each rotation
- When the eggs + mix start becoming less liquid, add a bit of milk
  and keep stirring
- Add the milk bit by bit to the mix while stirring

Then leave the bowl for 30 minutes minimum (ideally, up to 4 hours).

### The cooking

You'll need a pan, or ideally a [crêpiere](http://www.amazon.co.uk/VonShef-Professional-Quality-Electric-Spreader/dp/B00AMJ2IJK/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1409134365&sr=1-1&keywords=Krampouz)

Spread batter on the crêpiere, wait a few seconds, flip, wait,
flip back again, paint the crêpe with butter, fold.

Don't eat the first crêpe (in Britanny we say: "the first one goes to the dog").

Taste the second crêpe and decide to add sugar if it's not sweet enough,
or milk if the crêpe seems too thick.

Tip: Breton or Normand cider goes well with sweet crêpes.
