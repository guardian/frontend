    <h2>Matchday Feed</h2>

    <p><strong>This is the feed you are most likely to be interested in.</strong> This feed shows detailed information on today&apos;s
        matches and is the feed we use while the match is live</p>

    <p>This api call also includes today&apos;s fixtures and results.</p>
