# Hologram will run from same directory where this config file resides
# All paths should be relative to there

# The directory containing the source files to parse recursively
source:
 - ./common/app/assets/stylesheets/module
 - ./common/app/assets/stylesheets/base

# The directory that hologram will build to
destination: ./docs/styleguide

# The assets needed to build the docs (includes header.html,
# footer.html, etc)
# You may put doc related assets here too: images, css, etc.

# Any other asset folders that need to be copied to the destination
# folder. Typically this will include the css that you are trying to
# document. May also include additional folders as needed.
# dependencies:
# - ./build

# Mark which category should be the index page
# Alternatively, you may have an index.md in the documentation assets
# folder instead of specifying this config.
