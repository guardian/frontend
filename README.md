Frontend
========
The Guardian website frontend.


Core Development Principles (lines in the sand)
===============================================

This applies to all requests on `www.theguardian.com` and `api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk` (our Ajax URL)

On the server
-------------

* Every request can be cached and has an appropriate Cache-Control header set.
* Each request may only perform 1 I/O operation on the backend. (you cannot
make 2 calls to the content API or any
  other 3rd party)
* The average response time of any endpoint is less than 500ms.
* Requests that take longer than 2 seconds will be terminated.

New developers quick-start
===========================
Frontend is a set of Play Framework 2 Scala applications.


Coding conventions
------------------
Install the EditorConfig plugin in your IDE/text editor: http://editorconfig.org/#download

It will read the contents of the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/blob/master/.editorconfig) file and set up your editor with the
correct encoding and indentation settings for the project.


Configuration
-------------
You need 3 files on your machine.

The first file is called `/etc/gu/install_vars` and has the following contentsâ€¦
```
STAGE=DEV
```

The second file is called `[YOUR_HOME_DIR]/.gu/frontend.properties` and you
can get its contents from a shared document. Ask your team mates to share it
with you. If it has already been shared with you just search for
"frontend.properties" in your documents.

The third file called `[YOUR_HOME_DIR]/.aws/credentials` is required to render Fronts and contains:
```
[nextgen]
aws_access_key_id=[YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY]
aws_secret_access_key=[YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
region=eu-west-1
```

Nginx
-----

If you are working on Identity or Discussion, Nginx must be installed and
configured to correctly serve the application, please refer to
[`/nginx/README.md`](./nginx/README.md) in this project.

Vagrant
-------
You can run the project with the supplied Vagrantfile - make sure you
understand what vagrant is http://www.vagrantup.com/

* Make sure you have [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
and [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html) installed
(on Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install virtualbox vagrant`)
* change directory into the folder where this README is located
* `vagrant up` - this will take a while, make some coffee
* You can now get onto the box by `vagrant ssh`
* the project is located in /vagrant so `cd /vagrant`
* `./sbt`


Local Install Requirements
--------------------------
* A Mac or Linux pc
* Installed Open JDK

	Linux: `sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk`

	Mac:   Download and install [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

* Installed Node.js (https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
* Installed npm (Node package manager - you quite possibly already have this). Some packages (imagemin) are not working with newest Node.js. So if you want to run multiple Node.js versions on your system you may want to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

* Installed Grunt (build tool) `sudo npm -g install grunt-cli`
* Installed Ruby >= v1.9.x (on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev`) &
 [bundler](http://gembundler.com/) (You may already have this installed, but
 run `ruby -v` to check version number)
* Xcode (if on a Mac, one of the Node modules requires it) https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835
* Installed Memcached `sudo apt-get install memcached` - this is optional
(most of the time you do not want to use it as caching makes local development
harder)
* Installed [libpng](http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html):
`brew install libpng` (Mac OSX with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)) or
`sudo apt-get install libpng-dev` (Ubuntu)


NPM ownership
-------------
Sometimes when you install npm it ends up owned by root (but in your home
directory).

Check that you own your own .npm directory `ls -ld ~/.npm`

If it is owned by root then take ownership of it
`sudo chown -R username:username ~/.npm`


File handles
------------
On Linux machines you may run into a "too many files open" error during
compilation or reloading. You can find out how many file handles you are
allowed per process by running `ulimit -n`. This can be quite low, e.g. 1024

To increase the limit do the following (instructions from Ubuntu 12.10)...

In the file `/etc/security/limits.conf` add the following two lines
```
*  soft  nofile 20000
*  hard  nofile 65000
```

And in the file `/etc/pam.d/common-session` add the following line.
```
session required pam_limits.so
```

Restart the machine.

For more info see http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-increase-the-maximum-number-of-open-files/

On OSX the open file limit can be even lower (256 or so).
To find out what it is run `ulimit -n` at the command prompt, and if it's a low number, you can fix it like this;
* Edit your `~/.bash-profile` file
* add the following line: `ulimit -n 1024`
* save and close the file
* back at the command prompt enter: `source .bash_profile` and hit return.

Now you should be able to compile and run. Yay.

Running
-------
Assuming you have checked out this project, open a console and change directory
into the root of the project.

Frontend is built in two parts, using Grunt for the client side asset build and
SBT for the Play Framework backend. Neither of these tools are much use for
building the other half of the project and coupling them together with an
integration is one of those bad ideas that is even worse than it sounds.

Install node dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Install additional dependencies:
```
bundle
```

After this, you can compile the assets (see the note about `grunt watch` [below](#client-side-development)):
```
grunt compile
```

In another console, start Simple Build Tool (sbt) using the supplied `sbt`
script. Note that if you start SBT any other way the project will not run.
```
./sbt
```

Once SBT is running (it may take a while to start the first time - you'll know
when you get a prompt), switch project by typing `project dev-build`. Then
compile and run the project locally by typing `run`. This also can take a
while first time.

Now test you are up and running by hitting the following URLs:
   * http://localhost:9000/books
   * http://localhost:9000/media/2012/dec/05/newspaper-editors-sign-up-leveson
   * http://localhost:9000/news/gallery/2012/dec/04/24-hours-in-pictures-gallery

Play Framework will recompile code changes on refresh.

To create project files for use in IntelliJ, run the `gen-idea` task from the
root SBT project. See https://github.com/mpeltonen/sbt-idea.

Further information on using the Play console is available
[here][play2-console].


Client-side development
-----------------------

There is a `grunt watch` task available to build and watch for development
changes, but `grunt-watch` is pretty inefficient to compile our Sass into CSS
so @mattosborn created a script called [grunt-csdevmode][grunt-csdevmode].

`grunt csdevmode` also pushes stylesheets to all connected browsers:
no need to reload a page to preview your changes, just like with Livereload.

```bash
grunt compile --dev
grunt csdevmode
```


Endpoints
---------
The available endpoints are listed in `conf/routes` of each application and
typically include:

* `/management`: Operations support as per standard webapp guidelines. See
  guardian-management.
* `/<path>`: Serve the Guardian URL at `<path>` if supported by this
  application.
* `/assets/<file>`: A convenience for DEV machines. Assets are CDNed in PROD
  and would not be available on DEV.


Deploying
---------
Deployment uses the [Magenta][magenta] library.


Debugging
---------
You can debug your local Frontend application, by attaching a debugger.

* Start Simple Build Tool in debug mode by typing `./sbt --debug`
* Build and run your application. See "Running" for steps.
* Use a debugger to attach to the remote Java process, on localhost:1044.

Any IDE debugger should be compatible. In IntelliJ, add a new Debug
Configuration, based on the Remote default.
Ensure the Transport is Socket, the Debugger mode is Attach, and the port is
set to 1044.
Start a new Debug session, and your breakpoints should be active.
