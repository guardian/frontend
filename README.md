Frontend
========

The Guardian website frontend.

New developers quick-start
===========================

Frontend is a set of Play Framework 2 Scala applications.

Requirements
------------

    * A Mac or Linux pc
    * Installed Node.js (https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
    * Installed npm (Node package manager - you quite possibly already have this) `sudo apt-get install npm`
    * Installed Grunt (build tool) `sudo npm -g install grunt-cli`

File handles
------------

On Linux machines you may run into a "too many files open" error during compilation or reloading. You can find out
how many file handles you are allowed per process by running `ulimit -n`. This can be quite low, e.g. 1024

To increase the limit do the following (instructions from Ubuntu 12.10)...

In the file `/etc/security/limits.conf` add the following two lines
```
*  soft  nofile 20000
*  hard  nofile 65000
```

And in the file `/etc/pam.d/common-session` add the following line.
```
session required pam_limits.so
```

restart the machine.

Configuration
-------------

You'll need a config file called _/etc/gu/install_vars_ with the following content :-

```
STAGE=DEV
INT_SERVICE_DOMAIN=gudev.gnl
EXT_SERVICE_DOMAIN=
```

And one called _~/.gu/frontend.properties_, ( alternatively _/gu/etc/frontend.properties_ ) with the following content :-

```
content.api.key=XXXX
content.api.host=http://XXXX
pa.api.key=XXXX
```

Get the correct key and host from another developer on the project.

To set up a proxy

```
export proxy_host=proxy.somewhere.com
export proxy_port=1234
```

Running
-------

Assuming you have checked out this project, open a console and change directory into the root of the project.

Start Simple Build Tool (sbt) by running `./sbt011 --no-proxy`

Once sbt is running (it may take a while first time) then compile the project by typing `compile` (also can take a while first time)

Switch project by typing `project dev-build`

Now start the local server by typing `run` (this too will take long the first time)

Now test you are up and running by hitting the following URLs:
   * http://localhost:9000/books
   * http://localhost:9000/media/2012/dec/05/newspaper-editors-sign-up-leveson
   * http://localhost:9000/news/gallery/2012/dec/04/24-hours-in-pictures-gallery


To use in Eclipse, use the `eclipsify` command. This will create Eclipse
project and settings files which can be imported using the Import Existing
Project options in Eclipse.

To use in IntelliJ, see https://github.com/mpeltonen/sbt-idea

Further information on using the Play console is available [here][play2-console].

Virtualisation
--------------
Virtualisation provides for robust development environments and a controlled
system dependency solution. See the instructions in `README.vagrant.md` for
using [Vagrant][vagrant] virtualisation with this project.


Endpoints
---------
The available endpoints are listed in `conf/routes` of each application and
typically include:

* `/management`: Operations support as per standard webapp guidelines. See
  guardian-management.
* `/pages/<path>`: Serve the Guardian URL at `<path>` if supported by this
  application.
* `/assets/<file>`: A convenience for DEV machines. Assets are CDNed in PROD
  and would not be available on DEV.
* `/<path>`: A synonym for `/pages/<path>` as a convenience for DEV machines.


Deploying
---------
Deployment uses the [Magenta][magenta] library.


No Proxy Build
--------------
Invoke `sbt011` with a `--no-proxy` parameter to directly download artifacts.
